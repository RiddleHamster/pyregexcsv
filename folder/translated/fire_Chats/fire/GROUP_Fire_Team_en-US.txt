[25.10.21 12:24:45] fire: ``
https://tox.chat/
there is such a messenger

https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore
Here's one of their projects on github
this is their kernel on which different clients are built - so to speak, the root library
it has all the functionality for cryptography, p2p networks, etc.

https://github.com/qTox/qTox
Here is the main client everyone uses
The client is built on this libe.
let's cut to the chase )

We need to find out
1) who is behind this project. Where the funding came from, it is necessary to untwist the chain of this funding as far as possible
I.e. at the end there is always a firm-layout, it has some connections, founders
The founders have their founders, etc., a graph of connections
2) what really happened, there was a story a couple of years ago about the theft of money, so that is concise and unbiased what is in the press
3) how many people they have left who are active developers, testers
4) do they have testing at all, if so how is it delivered
this can all be found out by means of githab and search through the githab - issue and everything
5) what else do the developers. Third-party projects. All available persdata on them.
who are they from where how many years ago
6) how many active projects-forms of tox and its subsystems are in the githab. Active means no commit older than one month. If there are such, they also need to be persdata

```
[25.10.21 12:25:45] fire: Agree who does what, all the information from here
[25.10.21 17:02:31] liam: I propose to divide by three, two questions each, for example me (fire), jeronimo and snow,
And then bio will combine all into one report
[25.10.21 17:03:21] liam: Just the same, there are four of us, except fire, it will be convenient)
Plus or something, if you agree and take on two questions
[25.10.21 17:04:47] bio: no problem
[25.10.21 17:06:35] liam: Ok, let's wait for the others and then we'll start.)
[25.10.21 17:06:42] bio: I'll work on all 6 questions too
[25.10.21 17:07:26] bio: how much time do we have?

[28.10.21 16:16:45] fire: Okay, for newbies:

I get piled up with tasks.
I distribute them among you in the team chat room
and then I'll give them to the adverts.

The reports are submitted as follows:

1) Pack in the archive (with or without password)
2) Upload it to send.exploit.in (1000 downloads/30 days)
3) Here send the obtained link in the following form:

```
COMPANY NAME Report
REFERENCE
PASSWORD (if any)
```

To format the text in this way, select it in its entirety, and click on the multi line icon immediately to the left of the word katex
and I advise everyone to download reports, read and study
maybe someone will learn something new, in terms of information on formatting and obtaining data

Example:

```
Raytheon Report

[08.11.21 09:34:15] mayor: ``
0. Use strong passwords.
At least 16 characters long, different character cases, alpha and numbers, punctuation marks and full ASCII alphabet.

1. You should transfer files to each other as an encrypted .rar archive with a password of at least 16 characters.
The password must be strong (see above).

THE ARCHIVE TABLE OF CONTENTS (FILE NAMES IN THE ARCHIVE) MUST BE ENCRYPTED.
This is a mandatory requirement.
File names say VERY much about you.

The name of the archive should not say anything.

modulename.22.09.2010.rar - bad name

c.rar or 1.rar is a good name

Avoid transferring files through privnote.com and similar services.
Remember that the transmitted text will remain in the server logs forever.

2.1 DO NOT OPEN other people's .doc, .docx, .xls, .pdf, .rtf, and so on - any files on your personal machine,
interpreted by the tuning-complete finite state machine (which almost all programs are).
These formats are used to plant viruses.
If you have to - virtual machine and virustotal to help.

Use only .txt format, and as an exception - images.
```
[08.11.21 09:35:10] cypher: I upload to exploit, as told. And I put a password. When I was hired I was sent a doc file with the report as an example. I submit it in csv format - contact details, and the company report with graphs and structures in PDF.
Now your rules have changed :)
[08.11.21 09:36:04] mayor: those who never change the rules quickly become someone's lunch
[08.11.21 09:36:06] cypher: 1) Pack archive (with or without password)
2) upload to send.exploit.in (1000 downloads/30 days)
3) Here send the link in the following form:



COMPANY NAME Report
LINK
PASSWORD (if any)
[08.11.21 09:37:41] cypher: So we should probably come to a common denominator, to avoid this. You can also transfer everything in text format, no problem, just will be a huge mess when generating a report.
And can you see an example with a report on the company, in txt format?
[08.11.21 09:39:50] mayor: What kind of rich text capabilities do you have in your reports that you can't represent in text?
[08.11.21 09:40:14] mayor: bold, italics, underline, strikethrough?
[08.11.21 09:40:17] mayor: built-in formulas?
[08.11.21 09:42:47] cypher: graphs
Tables

I'm not saying it's IMPOSSIBLE, I'm saying it will be mush.

I would like to see the report in txt, so to speak, as a standard.
[08.11.21 09:44:15] mayor: if you need to display something with a picture so you can't do it otherwise, you make a figure1.jpg file and write "see figure1.jpg file" in the text
[08.11.21 09:44:35] mayor: simple tables are mostly perfectly formatted with monospace fonts
[08.11.21 09:44:55] mayor: so how did this whole world work before the rich text era, in plain text, eh?
[08.11.21 09:44:55] cypher: I understand all this, can you see the standard in which to do all this?
[08.11.21 09:45:05] mayor: they launched people into space, they created ibm/360
[08.11.21 09:45:12] mayor: walked on the moon

[08.11.21 09:46:41] mayor: What task are you working on?
[08.11.21 09:47:18] cypher: None, I haven't been assigned any tasks yet. Those that were set - I completed and handed in. I didn't have any questions about the results.
[08.11.21 09:47:38] mayor: then the new task is to write a standard that you crave and send it to me and fire for review
[08.11.21 09:47:50] mayor: there's enough information in our correspondence above for him
[08.11.21 09:50:08] cypher: I need an example, because the example I was given was in doc format, and there was a lot of extra information I shouldn't have collected. Either specify the data of interest for the firm.
[08.11.21 09:50:32] cypher: Yes and the job was to collect information on the company and management, not to wank with making up formats
[08.11.21 09:51:00] cypher: You just have an understanding of how you want to see information, and what information you want to see. Why not talk about that?
[08.11.21 10:20:36] mayor: so
[08.11.21 10:20:39] mayor: @fire
[08.11.21 10:20:54] mayor: @cypher was tasked with adapting your reports format to security requirements
[08.11.21 10:21:05] mayor: .docx .pdf files any office formats - not secure
[08.11.21 10:21:28] mayor: You put yourself and your clients in danger by transmitting them

[08.11.21 10:22:49] mayor: cypher will prepare report template in .txt format with pictures and rich-text chips as attachments
will give you examples of how to make tables, how to format text with bold/italic/underline/strike (if you don't understand, ask me)
[08.11.21 10:24:02] mayor: also, instruct people again about secure file transfers via third party services (so you can extract the minimum info from filenames, etc., as mentioned above) and make sure you do it
[08.11.21 10:24:12] mayor: no more distractions
[08.11.21 10:40:08] bio: hi all, it was high time to come to some formats. because i tried not to do pdf as a matter of principle, i've had enough of it before))). what concerns data contained in vodk docks - format .rtf has nothing in it, like xt, but to screw in load there with existing exploits is not a problem. That's true. so then we wait what cypher will do there)
[08.11.21 10:54:03] bio: But again, you have to realize that if we come to the format .TXT, it will obviously increase the time to create a report, especially if you have to work with tables, and if there will be graphic data? Then you probably need to make screenshots by pictures or what? In general, you need such a good template, which will be shown as much as possible different formats of data: text, pictures, tables, charts, etc..
[08.11.21 11:14:26] fire: ok, let it be like this
[08.11.21 11:15:15] fire: earlier adverts just asked for pdf)
[08.11.21 11:16:40] bio: so if adverts asked for pdf, then maybe you should agree with them on data format too, after all they are customers
[08.11.21 11:17:25] fire: I'll ask
but the main point is to make the reports readable
[08.11.21 11:17:39] fire: it's much harder to do in txt, but it's possible
[08.11.21 11:18:20] bio: you can, but you can't put all the information into txt

I'm glad there was no such thing for a long time, if you want to discuss something, better write to each other personally, it's unprofessional, you may not get fired for this, but we all will be more pleasant to work, if you behave like an adult)

[21.02.22 14:00:42] fire: good, too :)
[21.02.22 14:23:02] fire: gentlemen, all is not very good
[21.02.22 14:23:06] fire: I sincerely apologize for having to ignore your questions for the last few days. Regarding the Chief, Silver, salaries and everything else.
The reason I had to is because I simply had nothing to say to you. I was dragging my feet, screwing around with the salary as best I could, hoping that the Chief would show up and give us clarity on our next steps.
But the chief is gone, and the situation around us is not getting any softer, and pulling the cat by the balls makes no sense anymore.

We are in a difficult situation, with too much outside scrutiny of the firm, and the boss has apparently decided to lay low.
There have been many leaks, post-New Year's receptions, and many other circumstances that incline us all to take some time off and wait for the situation to settle down.
The reserve money that was set aside for emergencies and urgent team needs was not even enough to cover the last paycheck. There is no boss, no clarity or certainty about what we will do in the future, no money either.
We hope that the boss will appear and the company will continue to work, but in the meantime, on behalf of the company I apologize to all of you and ask for patience. All balances on wages will be paid, the only question is when.
Now I will ask all of you to write to me in person: (ideally in the toadbox:))
- Up-to-date backup contact for communication (preferably register fresh nowhere fried public toadbug
- Briefly about your duties, projects, and the Japanese language (for coders). Who did what, literally in a nutshell.

In the near future, we, with those teamleaders who have remained in line - will think how to restart all work processes, where to find money for payments on wages and with new strength to run all our work projects.
As soon as there is any news about payments, reorganization and getting back to work - I will contact everyone. In the meantime, I have to ask all of you to take 2-3 months off.
We will try to get back to work as soon as possible. From you all, please be concerned about your personal safety! Clean up the working systems, change your accounts on the forums, VPNs, if necessary, phones and PCs.
Your security is first and foremost your responsibility! To yourself, to your loved ones and to the team too!

I ask you not to break up my personal contacts with inquiries about the chief - I will not tell anyone anything new, because I simply do not know.
Once again, I apologize Friends, myself is not thrilled with all these events, we will try to somehow fix the situation.
Those who do not want to move with us on - we naturally understand. Those who will wait - 2-3 months rest, engaged in private life and enjoy the freedom üôÇ .

All working rockets and internal toadstools will soon be disconnected, further communication is only by backup toadstools. All the world.
