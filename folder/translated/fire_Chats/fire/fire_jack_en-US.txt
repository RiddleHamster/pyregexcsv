[06.10.21 20:17:54] fire: You bet.
[06.10.21 20:18:01] jack: they asked for ID and first name
[06.10.21 20:18:14] fire: hmm
[06.10.21 20:18:22] fire: And if you call by changing the number
[06.10.21 20:18:35] fire: then first name is known

[06.10.21 20:21:32] fire: Whose number we're calling from
[06.10.21 20:22:10] jack: well, yeah. in principle, you could try to break through that way. but then we would have to change the script))
[06.10.21 20:22:20] jack: I'll think about it.
[06.10.21 20:22:33] fire: ++
[06.10.21 20:22:37] jack: by the way

[06.10.21 20:23:42] jack: so if you can try to search on the subject (defense and contractors, aero space, chemical, medical equipment manufacturers, oil gas, hotels,)
[06.10.21 20:23:51] fire: I'll try.
[06.10.21 20:24:03] fire: but I can't promise tomorrow, I'm busy now.

[06.10.21 20:24:29] fire: we can do more
[06.10.21 20:24:46] jack: ok thanks for the idea. I'll give it a try. maybe a new script should be invented.
[06.10.21 20:25:03] fire: no problem.)
