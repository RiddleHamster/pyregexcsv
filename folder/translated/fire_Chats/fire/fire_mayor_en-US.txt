[23.06.21 10:46:13] mayor: and take the alter task

[23.06.21 10:46:48] mayor: in the alter's task, pay attention to mapping their networks, external resources
[23.06.21 10:46:55] fire: today I'll map what's left of tsys
[23.06.21 10:47:03] fire: and take one from Alter
[23.06.21 10:47:22] mayor: with network mapping is still such a thing - information on AS (autonomous system) is important
[23.06.21 10:47:43] fire: this is something you have to look into with schodan, I'll look into it on the way
[23.06.21 10:48:23] mayor: yes, it would be nice to work out how to map autonomous systems, it's very important info

* A wide range of searchers

==============================================================================

https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester - collecting email addresses, subdomains, virtual hosts, open ports/banners, employee names from public sources.

It doesn't work for me, it doesn't install correctly
Installation commands:

git clone https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester
cd theHarvester
python3 -m pip install -r requirements/base.txt
python3 theHarvester.py -h


==============================================================================

https://mor-pah.net/software/dmitry-deepmagic-information-gathering-tool/ - Dmitry - analog of the previous tool

Cool tool. Pulls out the information, you can use it.
Installation via compilation, but there is a manual - nothing complicated

==============================================================================

https://github.com/0xInfection/TIDoS-Framework - universal framework with network analysis capabilities (DNS, whois, emails)

Installation:
sudo apt-get install libncurses5 libxml2 nmap tcpdump libexiv2-dev build-essential python3-pip libmariadbclient18 libmysqlclient-dev tor konsole
git clone https://github.com/0xinfection/tidos-framework.git
cd tidos-framework
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Running:
python3 tidv2 #Qt5 interface
sudo python3 tidconsole.py #console interface

installed, but to disassemble and disassemble, a very massive set of aces

==============================================================================

https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot

The tool is good, but it's easier to use the web version.
Provides good mapping, like this:
https://prnt.sc/17bpc7y
minus that you can't export without a subscription, about 80 euros a month
very useful tool, in fact
if there is an option, you can get an account


==============================================================================


  https://osintframework.com/ - OSINT tools rubricator, general search by social networks, large set of different search tools:
  
you can pick, a simple osintype toolbase
  
==============================================================================

https://hunter.io/ - gather email info by domain name
Checked it, gives results, but not many, at raytheon gave out 41 people
paid, 50 euros a month, gives about 10 results without payment
I used google.

==============================================================================

* Company search engines
https://www.zoominfo.com - company data search engine
it's all clear, it's a well-known tool
  
https://opencorpdata.com/ - Open corporate business database
basic data on corporations, also useful in providing insight into the consolidation of subsidiaries

https://domainbigdata.com/ - big database of domains and whois records
standard domain data

https://opencorporates.com/ - largest open database of companies in the world
https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/cik.htm - EDGAR Company Filings | Central Index Key Lookup
http://www.orsr.sk/search_osoba.asp?lan=en - Business register | Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic


* Search by USERNAME/NICKNAME:
https://namechk.com/
it's more of an aggregator, showing if social network domains and nicknames are available or not.
useful in certain situations, but by no means always

https://github.com/snooppr/snoop
We need to dig, the functionality is clear, but the console is not friendly at all


* Network mapping
https://crt.sh/ - search for subdomains
it's not a search for subdomains, it's a search for certificates

https://archive.org/web/ - search in the past (view sites on a certain date)
it's all clear here)

https://viewdns.info/ - data about a given website or IP address
a large set of tools that does not give anything unique.
useful because everything is in one place

[28.07.21 12:19:28] fire: And the big ones?
[28.07.21 12:19:35] mayor: you can also use Storm for info gathering, but keep in mind he's a liaison and feedback will go through him
[28.07.21 12:19:37] mayor: yes
[28.07.21 12:19:41] fire: Got it
[28.07.21 12:20:12] fire: we've already communicated with Storm, he's also the caller's team leader
[28.07.21 12:20:13] mayor: consider him a client on the same level as alter and derek, just playing)
[28.07.21 12:20:16] mayor: yes
[28.07.21 12:20:33] fire: Got it.
[28.07.21 12:21:04] fire: just give it to him?
he said his guys know what to do with the data
[28.07.21 12:23:10] mayor: yes, just give it to him
[28.07.21 12:23:16] mayor: ask him for feedback
[28.07.21 12:23:18] fire: ++

[28.07.21 13:22:09] mayor: well, yes, from the first list it is energetics

[30.07.21 10:50:14] mayor: happy birthday!)
[30.07.21 10:50:15] mayor: come on!

[30.07.21 10:50:22] fire: ++
[30.07.21 10:50:23] mayor: you may, of course
[30.07.21 10:50:29] mayor: what I wanted
[30.07.21 10:50:33] mayor: you've got to learn how to do it
[30.07.21 10:50:39] fire: plan?
[30.07.21 10:51:08] fire: written, oral?
[30.07.21 10:51:23] mayor: Well, look.
[30.07.21 10:51:39] mayor: it turns out the callers don't do the wiring themselves and work on ready-made
[30.07.21 10:51:46] mayor: i.e. this dossier is not enough for them
[30.07.21 10:52:02] mayor: they need to say something in clear text, an introduction to a dialog with possible developments
[30.07.21 10:52:10] mayor: they need both written and oral
[30.07.21 10:52:12] fire: hmm, but they said they know what to say)
[30.07.21 10:52:14] mayor: written is a letter
[30.07.21 10:52:25] mayor: there are variations
[30.07.21 10:52:29] fire: no problem with letters, that's my main occupation
[30.07.21 10:52:36] fire: spam emails)
[30.07.21 10:52:47] mayor: good divorce is usually multi-step
[30.07.21 10:53:06] mayor: warm-up, then main part
[30.07.21 10:53:10] mayor: writing can be a warm-up
[30.07.21 10:53:24] mayor: the main part is a call, could be "there's a letter for you, you probably didn't notice, there's a link"
[30.07.21 10:53:49] mayor: or "that link/attachment is wrong, you need this and that, download at this address/start" etc.
[30.07.21 10:53:59] fire: do you work with links?
[30.07.21 10:54:04] fire: Or just attachments, too?
[30.07.21 10:54:07] mayor: we're going to find out
[30.07.21 10:54:10] fire: ++
[30.07.21 10:54:27] mayor: not the point yet
[30.07.21 10:54:30] mayor: the point is in the roll
[30.07.21 10:54:42] mayor: let's try to do a test roll on someone
[30.07.21 10:54:56] fire: let me think about it
[30.07.21 10:55:00] fire: what's the goal?
[30.07.21 10:55:19] mayor: any of those we tried to give the call center
[30.07.21 10:55:34] fire: no, I mean, what do we expect from the target
[30.07.21 10:55:46] fire: open the file, follow the link
[30.07.21 10:55:48] mayor: it should run the load anyway
[30.07.21 10:55:58] mayor: either open or jump
[30.07.21 10:56:04] fire: and where will the first email come from, from corporate mail or from bigs?
[30.07.21 10:56:16] mayor: don't know
[30.07.21 10:56:21] mayor: not ready to tell yet
[30.07.21 10:56:25] mayor: what's better?
[30.07.21 10:57:17] fire: this is quite an important point, because the wiring will be different
if it's a corporation, it's the easiest, because you can attach a commercial offer, or a contract, or overdue payments, etc.
[30.07.21 10:57:44] mayor: tell me what you need from me
[30.07.21 10:57:48] fire: and if you are a big - you have to think, I can't yet formulate why a person would write to someone on the corporate e-mail
[30.07.21 10:57:50] mayor: what mail/accounts you need to get where
[30.07.21 10:58:10] fire: I think it should be solved with your spammers
[30.07.21 10:58:17] fire: where they can send you emails from
[30.07.21 10:58:28] fire: and use it as a base
[30.07.21 10:58:55] mayor: there is a theoretical possibility of using insiders of some companies, but we have to work it out
[30.07.21 10:59:00] mayor: we haven't tried it
[30.07.21 10:59:12] mayor: maybe this will be the next step
[30.07.21 10:59:33] fire: purely corporate mail is of course preferable
there may be many intersections of interests
[30.07.21 11:00:21] fire: if you write by the same tcis, you can make a request for purchase/order of something on behalf of corporation and send it by dock
[30.07.21 11:01:04] mayor: can you give me a rough version?
[30.07.21 11:01:13] mayor: we won't send/call you right away
[30.07.21 11:01:28] mayor: while we show and find out what is missing, I will punch in the rest
[30.07.21 11:01:53] fire: or the opposite, call, find out who to contact about this
and already write a letter to this person
[30.07.21 11:02:12] fire: about the ordering, for example
[30.07.21 11:02:32] fire: the main thing is that the character has access
[30.07.21 11:04:26] mayor: it will mostly be IT
[30.07.21 11:04:40] mayor: although in principle, you could also target sales and customer service departments
[30.07.21 11:05:01] mayor: well, it's not right today, I put out a fishing rod, you think over it, I'll ask around too
[30.07.21 11:05:02] fire: yes, the main thing is to get access to the network, as I understand
[30.07.21 11:05:07] fire: Got it.
[30.07.21 11:05:13] fire: I'll think about it at the weekend
[30.07.21 11:05:20] mayor: well, salespeople also have the same network, it's just IT people are closer to all sorts of DC
[30.07.21 11:05:22] mayor: AD
[30.07.21 11:05:32] fire: Got it.
[30.07.21 11:05:57] fire: I'll think about IT guys, I have no idea how to get close to them yet
[30.07.21 11:06:26] mayor: Let's go to the ones who are lousier
[30.07.21 11:06:35] fire: Considering their data is not in the public domain, and as a rule, no one from the street will write to them
[02.08.21 12:55:44] mayor: hi.
[02.08.21 14:50:31] fire: hi)
[02.08.21 14:51:01] fire: contact search
[02.08.21 15:19:46] fire: so I take it, he also on search?
[02.08.21 15:21:02] mayor: let's do it tomorrow
[02.08.21 15:21:46] fire: ok, no problem
[03.08.21 12:56:42] fire: hi
[03.08.21 12:56:51] mayor: hi.
[03.08.21 12:57:09] fire: you wrote yesterday, said you want to discuss something tomorrow
[03.08.21 12:57:19] mayor: this)
[03.08.21 12:57:25] mayor: you're already in the next chat room?
[03.08.21 12:57:33] fire: ah, that's the chat room)
[03.08.21 12:57:34] fire: yes
[03.08.21 12:57:38] fire: already in place
[03.08.21 12:57:39] mayor: this is a new direction
[03.08.21 12:57:41] fire: tusk
[03.08.21 12:57:45] mayor: got it.
[03.08.21 13:00:50] fire: I'll give you a couple more
[03.08.21 13:01:01] fire: at least watch Liam learn from me
[03.08.21 13:01:19] mayor: come back later
[03.08.21 13:01:32] mayor: we'll discuss it and then we'll discuss the main direction with you
[03.08.21 13:01:36] fire: ++
[03.08.21 13:02:04] fire: and @link wrote, asked to work in his direction
[03.08.21 13:02:21] mayor: he's kind of a derek's assistant
[03.08.21 13:02:25] mayor: what did he want?
[03.08.21 13:03:45] fire: repeat that
[03.08.21 13:03:49] fire: The detachment
[03.08.21 13:04:31] mayor: what did he want?
[03.08.21 13:05:01] fire: he wanted one of those companies he gave with tsys
[03.08.21 13:10:52] fire: I could chat, but I don't have negotiation skills.
[03.08.21 13:11:16] fire: worked for similar theme but very little, the company folded there
[03.08.21 13:12:34] mayor: they can communicate by themselves
[03.08.21 13:12:38] fire: ++
[03.08.21 13:12:45] mayor: they have no topics for communication now, and you have to give them
[03.08.21 13:12:58] mayor: you must quickly find the list of people to talk to and the list of topics
[03.08.21 13:13:04] mayor: the firm's pain points
[03.08.21 13:14:00] fire: Yeah, I see.
[03.08.21 13:17:52] mayor: the way I see it:
1) you should be told that such-and-such firm is being taken into development. At that point, they already have a date.
2) you request a date listing AND ad_users.txt (Active Directory user dump)
3) using the AD dump you search for contacts of your colleagues.
4) in the date you find the list of counterparties, maybe some compromising information.
5) You give this data to the chief of hackers and the chief of callers.
6) you give the entire date further to the born in our chat room. He collects it.
[03.08.21 13:18:38] fire: Okay.
[03.08.21 13:18:39] fire: sec
[03.08.21 13:18:44] fire: formulate questions
[03.08.21 13:23:52] fire: so
[03.08.21 13:23:55] fire: see
[03.08.21 13:23:58] fire: it turns out
[03.08.21 13:28:42] fire: 1) I get data, specifically listing and dump
2) I extract data
3) look for dirt
4) give it tokyo and aqua
5) give them to born

regarding

1) How do I process the data - I mean, what format will it be in?
text docs, maybe some software is needed
because I was going through the logs, they use software to pull the data

2) On the department itself - I understand that I have liam working under the old scheme, he is not involved here?

3) on coordination - it will take place in that chat room, they both have to work now?
[03.08.21 13:31:35] mayor: half an hour
[03.08.21 13:31:39] fire: ++
[03.08.21 13:31:40] mayor: distracted by urgent and important
[03.08.21 13:31:47] fire: got it, I'm on line
[03.08.21 13:41:25] mayor: 1 - you determine. We can give you coder(s) to write your needed parsers or get/adapt them.
[03.08.21 13:41:46] mayor: 2 - you control the people the way you want, as long as everything works in general
[03.08.21 13:42:03] fire: he's de whitehat just)
[03.08.21 13:42:06] mayor: 3 - it's not clear yet. Here they have access, but they most likely blew it, so apparently we to them
[03.08.21 13:42:11] fire: ahah
[03.08.21 13:42:13] fire: got it
[03.08.21 13:42:38] fire: so I understand, we have first order, even 2
[03.08.21 13:42:52] fire: ?
[03.08.21 13:43:21] mayor: yeah
[03.08.21 13:43:28] mayor: well, these burning orders are
[03.08.21 13:43:40] mayor: it's uncomfortable to work there because most likely they already made mistakes
[03.08.21 13:43:47] mayor: I don't expect much there
[03.08.21 13:43:56] fire: yes, that's clear
[03.08.21 13:44:01] mayor: so don't pay attention to the outcome of those cases
[03.08.21 13:44:11] mayor: Next, new cases, and we'll test the method there.
[03.08.21 13:45:10] fire: Got it, got it.
[03.08.21 13:45:25] fire: at the same time I'll see how the date looks like
[03.08.21 13:45:34] mayor: stock from this topic
[03.08.21 13:46:24] mayor: let's get back to the topic with reconnaissance for new purposes
[03.08.21 13:46:30] mayor: to the very first direction
[03.08.21 13:46:34] fire: okay.
[03.08.21 13:46:54] mayor: look.
[03.08.21 13:46:58] mayor: we have to combine business with pleasure
[03.08.21 13:47:04] mayor: you get the date
[03.08.21 13:47:20] mayor: This firm works with someone
[03.08.21 13:47:35] mayor: it has partners, suppliers, clients
[03.08.21 13:47:47] mayor: that means there are contacts of these contractors
[03.08.21 13:47:58] mayor: and there is a reason - correspondence, some cases, unclosed topics
[03.08.21 13:48:06] mayor: and there is access to sending mail!
[03.08.21 13:48:17] mayor: you're inside the firm already, hackers will do whatever you say
[03.08.21 13:48:25] mayor: get it?
[03.08.21 13:48:46] fire: comprehending)
[03.08.21 13:48:47] fire: sec.
[03.08.21 13:48:55] mayor: I want to move horizontally
[03.08.21 13:49:15] mayor: just these firms should be filtered by turnover, choosing only the most major partners
[03.08.21 13:49:16] fire: That's my understanding.
[03.08.21 13:49:34] fire: you want to get access to partners
[03.08.21 13:49:38] fire: correct?
[03.08.21 13:49:38] mayor: yes
[03.08.21 13:49:42] fire: gut
[03.08.21 13:49:43] mayor: that's perfect social
[03.08.21 13:49:44] fire: understand
[03.08.21 13:49:57] mayor: you have a huge data set - cling to whatever you want
[03.08.21 13:50:03] mayor: real names, real correspondence
[03.08.21 13:50:08] fire: yeah, I get it.
[03.08.21 13:50:11] mayor: you can do Re: to the real letter
[03.08.21 13:50:13] fire: that's very cool
[03.08.21 13:50:19] fire: especially with letters
[03.08.21 13:50:23] fire: trust is trust
[03.08.21 13:50:54] mayor: let's not try to grasp the immensity yet
[03.08.21 13:51:03] mayor: let Liam learn and master the methodology
[03.08.21 13:51:14] mayor: and do reconnaissance for derek and linc
[03.08.21 13:51:24] mayor: you concentrate on escorting locs
[03.08.21 13:51:29] fire: got it
[03.08.21 13:51:50] mayor: Once you've handled a few cases, you'll know what's in that date, you'll get better at handling it.
[03.08.21 13:52:09] mayor: i saw raytheon in the linoleum manufacturer's date
[03.08.21 13:52:23] mayor: and such grunts will be many places
[03.08.21 13:52:56] mayor: i want us to work up a methodology on horizontal walking from linoleum suppliers to raytheon and boeing
[03.08.21 13:53:03] fire: well, yeah.
[03.08.21 13:53:14] fire: can you also order vpns through you?
[03.08.21 13:53:18] mayor: yes
[03.08.21 13:53:26] fire: oh, very good
[03.08.21 13:53:30] mayor: whatever you need, ask french and/or tokyo

[03.08.21 13:56:10] mayor: share the date with born - any available
[03.08.21 13:56:12] mayor: just about any
[03.08.21 13:56:20] fire: got it
[03.08.21 13:56:25] mayor: even better to ask hackers for excess dates
[03.08.21 13:56:35] mayor: you don't need it, but you feel it's useful
[03.08.21 13:56:46] mayor: you must throw him all the listings
[03.08.21 13:56:52] mayor: he'll tell you what to order
[03.08.21 13:56:53] fire: stop
[03.08.21 13:56:58] fire: listing it?
[03.08.21 13:57:19] mayor: > 2) you are requesting a date listing AND ad_users.txt (Active Directory user dump)
[03.08.21 13:57:30] mayor: this is the result of running the DIR command recursively over the entire disk

Hi! If the topic of Tox is still relevant, I suggest to buy an account on GitHub (500r from dude on mipped.com - https://mipped.com/f/threads/prodam-akkaunty-github.88373/ ), under it take some repositories to work on Tox.chat on GitHub and write to the main developer of Tox (it looks like irungento) and everyone who theoretically can be active in relation to the project.

You can write asking to describe the main "holes" in the development of Tox.Chat like for the case. If it works, then you can ask in more detail who is now engaged in the project (ostensibly to join forces). Who, who, and the main developer may know who is interested in it now.

Security related actions:
On mipped, sign up via anonymous email (I have such a valid email at tutanota.com). You need this to email the seller of the GitHub account.
All transitions via tor

What to write approximately:
Hey! My name is Ferréol, I am a programmer in a French IT company. I believe in the Tox project because I feel it is the future of anonymity on the Internet. Usually I work with C# and C++, so how can I help someone who is working on Tox.chat? Can you tell me someone who is actively working on the project right now? thx

[12.11.21 13:30:35] mayor: if you have psy+, in the Name field you change the domain to the new one, and in the XMPP address field you leave it as is
[12.11.21 13:30:35] mayor: i.e. regardless of the client
- the address of the server you're connecting to changes
- your account address (name@domain) stays the same

[12.11.21 13:33:44] mayor: all I did was replace the domain in the Name field:
[12.11.21 13:33:49] mayor: without changing ports or anything else
[12.11.21 13:33:59] mayor: but when I changed it following the instructions it didn't work
[12.11.21 13:34:12] mayor: i.e. you have to roll back to "before instruction" settings
[12.11.21 13:34:19] mayor: and change domain in Name field:
[12.11.21 13:35:47] fire: Nope.
