[15.07.21 15:06:46] born: hi, I'm writing a parser here. I haven't contacted you yet, but I was just told that you're my teammate) I mostly sit with the major in chat)
[15.07.21 15:06:59] born: if anything, I'm on the line.)
[15.07.21 15:31:20] fire: Hi.)
[15.07.21 15:31:27] fire: you work with aspen?
[15.07.21 15:31:53] born: roughly speaking yes) but at the moment I'm working on the database
[15.07.21 15:32:18] fire: got it
[15.07.21 15:32:42] fire: when you're done with parser, write and I'll give you the firm and the template
[15.07.21 15:32:46] fire: :)
[15.07.21 15:32:55] born: ok)
[15.07.21 16:48:33] born: listen, do you know anything about python?
[15.07.21 16:48:41] born: I have a bug in my code and I can't figure out where
[15.07.21 16:48:42] fire: no
[15.07.21 16:48:47] fire: not familiar at all)
[15.07.21 16:48:53] born: okay.)
[15.07.21 16:49:03] born: the problem is in line limitation)
[15.07.21 16:49:10] born: some part is parsed
[15.07.21 16:49:24] born: I'll look for it)
[15.07.21 16:49:40] fire: aren't there any special checkers?
[15.07.21 16:49:53] fire: like Dreamweaver for html
[15.07.21 16:50:12] born: there are checkers for file size, for example, but my file size is all right
[15.07.21 16:50:19] fire: Ah, got it.
[15.07.21 16:50:35] born: I'll try to check your database logs.)
[15.07.21 16:50:39] fire: you can just run html for errors, with this sign)
[15.07.21 16:50:55] born: ah, well, xtml yes) and here dumps txt
[15.07.21 16:51:05] fire: Mm-hmm.)
[16.07.21 12:12:15] born: hi) Sorry, there was a little confusion, mayor said that while I work with him, and you have your own work front)
[16.07.21 12:12:39] fire: No problem)
[16.07.21 12:13:04] fire: If you need something in English, write to me.
[16.07.21 12:13:11] born: ooh, cool.)
[16.07.21 12:13:20] born: thanks.)
[16.07.21 12:13:25] born: I have intermediate
[16.07.21 12:13:31] born: but I want to get it up)
[09.08.21 09:56:42] born: hi
[09.08.21 09:56:46] born: you need a parser
[09.08.21 09:57:04] fire: hi)
[09.08.21 09:57:05] fire: yes
[09.08.21 09:57:07] born: you can show me an example of dade, and tell me what you need from the parser
[09.08.21 09:57:11] fire: I'll show you.
[09.08.21 09:57:36] fire: look, the point is this: I'm going through the ad_users files, and I need to pull certain strings from them
In particular, I'd like the output to look like this:

[09.08.21 09:59:16] fire: here is a sample output
[09.08.21 09:59:34] fire: in general, all these lines are not always there, if some are missing - not critical, but the order of appearance is correct
the person block starts with >objectClass:, ends with >msExchAuditDelegate: - these two lines always exist
that's it)
and a separator between the blocks to show who's who
[09.08.21 10:00:04] born: so we just parse everything from ad_users in normal order, right?
[09.08.21 10:00:23] born: do you want it exactly like this or can you use a table as an example?
[09.08.21 10:00:28] fire: there are a lot of people in the file)
[09.08.21 10:00:29] fire: people
[09.08.21 10:00:32] fire: yes
[09.08.21 10:00:44] fire: I don't really care, just cut off the unnecessary data
[09.08.21 10:00:56] born: I have a parser in python
[09.08.21 10:01:03] born: it pretty much cuts off all data
[09.08.21 10:01:10] born: just writes to the database instead of output
[09.08.21 10:01:16] fire: I was looking at it, I thought about trying to write it myself, but I don't know enough
[09.08.21 10:01:21] fire: I can use a table
[09.08.21 10:01:41] fire: the main thing is to keep your results in order
[09.08.21 10:02:21] fire: and, if it's possible - to save results from one file to one table, not so that 1 person-1 file
[09.08.21 10:02:34] fire: because that would make it even harder
[09.08.21 10:03:03] born: tex, when do you need it?
[09.08.21 10:04:05] fire: well, whenever it's convenient, I'm still doing it by hand
it's just faster.
[09.08.21 10:04:31] born: I'll try to make a table with the main data
[09.08.21 10:04:35] born: I'll think of something
[09.08.21 10:05:00] born: there's a whole division already there, the problem with making one table is that all users have different columns
[09.08.21 10:05:04] born: I just worked with them already
[09.08.21 10:05:17] born: my entry didn't depend on the number of columns
[09.08.21 10:05:31] born: these are the columns that you have now in your example are the main ones?
[09.08.21 10:05:48] fire: yes, but not everyone has them
[09.08.21 10:05:55] born: yes
[09.08.21 10:06:07] fire: some people don't have voip fields, some people have addresses
[09.08.21 10:06:07] fire: etc.
[09.08.21 10:06:49] fire: but in general, besides the others you don't need lines on the thread
[09.08.21 10:07:37] born: I'll try to adapt it to your needs, and when I get something, I'll let you know
[09.08.21 10:08:19] fire: ok
[09.08.21 10:08:19] fire: thanks a lot!
[09.08.21 10:08:41] born: you know what option is for you
[09.08.21 10:08:53] born: that would work right now
[09.08.21 10:09:14] born: and for local solution and automation will work
[09.08.21 10:10:30] born: you can install mongodb, use my script and upload data there, it's ready to work. mongodb is easy to connect, no problem. Then, you use the script to populate the data there, the table will be created automatically
[09.08.21 10:10:46] born: you'll have a local database with ad_users for each company
[09.08.21 10:10:54] born: whatever you want
[09.08.21 10:11:07] born: and you can get the table yourself
[09.08.21 10:11:10] born: from there
[09.08.21 10:11:22] born: for each company
[09.08.21 10:12:09] born: it's just a working solution and there's no problem with it, it's already been run through
[09.08.21 10:12:24] born: I can walk you through the process if you want
[09.08.21 10:12:43] born: once you learn, it'll work all the time
[09.08.21 10:14:24] fire: great, let's try it
[09.08.21 10:14:38] fire: I'll set it up later
[09.08.21 10:14:46] born: I'll send you links to put it in
[09.08.21 10:14:54] fire: okay
[09.08.21 10:15:26] born: you already ran any scripts on the machine7
[09.08.21 10:15:27] born: ?
[09.08.21 10:16:04] fire: in general or specifically on this one?
[09.08.21 10:16:12] born: specifically this one
[09.08.21 10:16:17] fire: this one's empty, I haven't even put python in yet
[09.08.21 10:16:25] born: just if not, you'll need to allow scripts to run if not already allowed
[09.08.21 10:16:30] born: ah
[09.08.21 10:16:37] born: well, here we go.
[09.08.21 10:16:42] fire: okay.
[09.08.21 10:17:54] born: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community base, choose a platform there on the right and done
[09.08.21 10:18:43] born: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass client for nice base access
[09.08.21 10:19:04] born: these are all local solutions, so it's safe if anything
[09.08.21 10:21:07] born: when you're ready, let me know and we'll check it out
[09.08.21 10:33:45] fire: good
[09.08.21 15:21:36] fire: knock knock.)
[09.08.21 15:21:40] fire: I'm here
[09.08.21 15:21:58] born: great
[09.08.21 15:22:05] born: put mongo
[09.08.21 15:22:14] born: I'll send you the script
[09.08.21 15:22:22] born: you can open it and see how it works
[09.08.21 15:22:23] fire: yeah, I'm on it
[09.08.21 15:23:08] born: what's your operating system?
[09.08.21 15:23:15] fire: wine
[09.08.21 15:23:24] born: ah, I wrote for ubuntu
[09.08.21 15:23:33] born: whatever
[09.08.21 15:23:41] born: you just set the path to python at the beginning
[09.08.21 15:23:48] fire: well, if it's a client, then yes, it should make no difference)
[09.08.21 15:23:56] fire: python will also
[09.08.21 15:24:04] born: yeah, whatever)

[09.08.21 15:26:14] born: parser is not complex by itself, originally planned to set everything from outside of cmd
[09.08.21 15:26:31] born: but it went wrong, I didn't fix it, I just threw the list of directories manually
[09.08.21 15:26:43] fire: I'll check it now)
[09.08.21 15:28:09] born: you should have a passwordless mongo on your site, you can comment the password part there
[09.08.21 15:28:41] born: in general, everything should be clear there, I left comments wherever
[09.08.21 15:29:38] born: it accepts user and password if you want, you can also manually insert directory list from dump and it will parse from each directory
[09.08.21 15:30:11] fire: wait wait wait wait)
[09.08.21 15:30:17] born: ok)
[09.08.21 15:30:26] born: I'm just writing for the introductory purposes)
[09.08.21 15:31:40] born: the script parses about 97% of files, there are problematic ones, that have some more mistakes, or if the file is too big, there's a limit of 18 mb per monge file, almost all files are smaller in size
[09.08.21 15:35:30] fire: when installing, do you select run service as a local user?
[09.08.21 15:35:40] born: yes
[09.08.21 15:36:01] born: did you download the parser yet?
[09.08.21 15:36:16] fire: not yet, I'm still setting it up
[09.08.21 15:36:27] fire: Vpn's a little slow, it downloads slowly
[09.08.21 15:36:36] born: it's okay.)
[09.08.21 15:40:20] fire: writes

the domain, user name and/or password are icorrect
[09.08.21 15:40:26] fire: during installation
[09.08.21 15:40:40] born: now sec
[09.08.21 15:42:42] born: try without local user
[09.08.21 15:43:20] fire: ++
[09.08.21 15:43:37] fire: it is set
[09.08.21 15:44:03] born: okay
[09.08.21 15:44:08] born: compass will install quickly
[09.08.21 15:44:22] fire: it's going in right away
[09.08.21 15:44:22] born: shouldn't be hard to do
[09.08.21 15:44:33] born: okay
[09.08.21 15:44:36] born: it took me a while
[09.08.21 15:44:45] born: must have been a different version
[09.08.21 15:44:48] fire: they must have updated the installer)
[09.08.21 15:44:52] born: yeah
[09.08.21 15:53:49] fire: okay, it's up
[09.08.21 15:53:55] fire: compass is running
[09.08.21 15:54:13] born: compass is pretty easy to set up
[09.08.21 15:54:19] born: just type in localhost
[09.08.21 15:54:23] born: 27017 port
[09.08.21 15:54:25] born: and user admin
[09.08.21 15:54:32] born: no password
[09.08.21 15:54:39] born: put the same into the script
[09.08.21 15:54:44] born: and pymongo will connect
[09.08.21 15:54:46] fire: I didn't put anything in
[09.08.21 15:54:54] born: it was already there by default
[09.08.21 15:54:54] fire: pressed connect, it worked
[09.08.21 15:54:59] fire: yes
[09.08.21 15:55:06] born: have you downloaded the script yet?
[09.08.21 15:57:30] fire: yes
[09.08.21 15:58:05] born: is python already installed?
[09.08.21 15:58:21] born: add libraries from the script to it
[09.08.21 15:58:39] fire: yes
[09.08.21 15:58:45] born: ok
[09.08.21 16:03:58] fire: put python
[09.08.21 16:04:17] born: install libraries from the script
[09.08.21 16:04:22] born: then you can run it
[09.08.21 16:05:07] born: you must know how to run it
[09.08.21 16:05:22] fire: let's see)
[09.08.21 16:05:30] born: I don't know how your dumps are stored, but you should check your script and you'll understand everything)
[09.08.21 16:05:50] fire: they're just on the desktop
[09.08.21 16:05:54] fire: XD
[09.08.21 16:06:07] born: well, we'll just have to point the way)
[09.08.21 16:06:12] born: see what he takes at the beginning
[09.08.21 16:06:22] fire: now, sec
[09.08.21 16:06:33] born: the root directory, then the directories where the files are, and refers to the file itself in the directory
[09.08.21 16:07:16] born: so in the script you have to enter the beginning of the path, then the folders with the IPs, at least that's how it was for me, and there apply to the file name
[09.08.21 16:07:19] born: that's all in principle
[09.08.21 16:07:34] fire: I'll look into it
[09.08.21 16:07:43] fire: I'll let you know if there's anything.)
[09.08.21 16:07:48] born: okay)
[10.08.21 06:41:41] born: Hey, what's up? Did you get the script?
[10.08.21 08:39:14] fire: haven't figured it out yet)
[10.08.21 08:39:18] fire: I got a lot of work to do.

[21.02.22 14:16:48] fire: heard that the salary will be delayed
[21.02.22 14:17:17] born: and you're not in general chat?
[21.02.22 14:17:45] born: I sincerely apologize for having to ignore your questions over the past few days. Regarding the Chief, Silver, salaries and everything else.
I was forced to because I simply had nothing to say to you. I was dragging my feet, screwing around with the salary as best I could, hoping that the Chief would show up and give us clarity on our next steps.
But the chief is gone, and the situation around us is not getting any softer, and pulling the cat by the balls makes no sense anymore.

We are in a difficult situation, with too much outside scrutiny of the firm, and the boss has apparently decided to lay low.
There have been many leaks, post-New Year's receptions, and many other circumstances that incline us all to take some time off and wait for the situation to settle down.
The reserve money that was set aside for emergencies and urgent team needs was not even enough to cover the last paycheck. There is no boss, no clarity or certainty about what we will do in the future, no money either.
We hope that the boss will appear and the company will continue to work, but in the meantime, on behalf of the company I apologize to all of you and ask for patience. All outstanding payroll will be paid, the only question is when.
[21.02.22 14:17:59] born: I will now ask all of you to write to me in person: (ideally in the toadbox:))
- Actual backup contact for contact (preferably regenerate a fresh, nowhere fried public toadstool
- Briefly about your duties, projects, and the Japanese language (for coders). Who did what, literally in a nutshell.

In the near future, we, with those teamleaders who have remained in line - will think how to restart all work processes, where to find money for payments on wages and with new strength to run all our work projects.
As soon as there is any news about payments, reorganization and getting back to work - I will contact everyone. In the meantime, I have to ask all of you to take 2-3 months off.
We will try to get back to work as soon as possible. From you all, please be concerned about your personal safety! Clean up the working systems, change your accounts on the forums, VPNs, if necessary, phones and PCs.
Your security is first and foremost your responsibility! To yourself, to your loved ones and to the team too!

I ask you not to break up my personal contacts with questions about the chief - I will not tell anyone anything new, because I simply do not know.
Once again, I apologize Friends, myself is not thrilled with all these events, we will try to somehow fix the situation.
Those who do not want to move with us on - we naturally understand. Those who will wait - 2-3 months rest, engaged in private life and enjoy the freedom 🙂 .

All working rockets and internal toadstools will soon be disconnected, further communication is only by backup toadstools. Peace be with you all!
