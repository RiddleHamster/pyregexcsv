i take it you're a senior on the callers
i.e., you get the caller shuffle - you give it to the team

Look, I talked to @frances , the gist is this

Since your team is the main team of callers, we will not change anything here
So, you do not need to delve into osint, you need to develop a methodology for targeting
You have to work out what to say, what kind of proofs to give over the phone, so as not to be unsubstantiated, and so on.
It is important that callers understand what they are doing, and not just call receptionists

Accordingly, the main thing is to establish a connection between my department, yours and the hackers.
The hackers set up a net - they give me the input. I collect the data, wait for a command.
If the alter says the target doesn't contact me, I contact you, I give you the data on the call.
We think, decide how to talk.
and then the work of your team - they call, scare, give a report on the calls who got through and what they say.

That is, for now - to sit and smoke bamboo and be in touch)
as a job, you can tie your guys to search for contact information, so they will be toned down
zuminfo isn't critical here, order a couple of @frances signhair accts - I'm working on it, for example
[13.07.21 15:37:15] fire: well, you need to understand who to call - that is, in some cases we'll need a typical cretin, like uneducated janitor with access to the network (in order for him to poke around, running malware), and in some cases - top-managers, to panic and make them move for ransom
[14.07.21 09:25:35] storm: Hi everyone.   This conact was made more for the person who would be doing the phone search. As originally wanted... Also, we are connected by dialing.  We have been requesting accounts of sites for normal search... They haven't provided it yet... There will be a search person here... ...but if we need it, he'll pass it on to the caller.  ...or which will be provided by you...
[14.07.21 09:26:26] storm: About the call... The operators know how and what to say...
[14.07.21 13:30:14] fire: you know - great)
