[12.08.21 16:10:35] fire: Hello!)
[12.08.21 16:10:48] donald: Hi, nice to meet you!
[12.08.21 16:10:53] fire: me too!
[12.08.21 16:10:54] fire: look.
[12.08.21 16:11:08] fire: I'm a team leader on aspen.
[12.08.21 16:11:16] fire: familiar with this topic?
[12.08.21 16:11:56] donald: yes, that's why they took me)
[12.08.21 16:12:35] fire: super)
[12.08.21 16:13:39] fire: now, wait a sec, I'll talk to manky, we'll decide how to work
[12.08.21 16:13:51] fire: he wants you to work with us
[12.08.21 16:14:21] fire: ))
[12.08.21 16:14:26] donald: That's good to hear!
[12.08.21 16:14:32] donald: I tried to get to you)
[12.08.21 16:14:44] fire: yes, there's a lot to strive for.)
[12.08.21 16:14:56] fire: work in general is interesting, the motivation is great
[12.08.21 16:15:16] donald: there's a whole new field here - you can open a new page in Ransom
[12.08.21 16:15:23] donald: a chapter even.)
[12.08.21 16:15:25] fire: yes, yes
[12.08.21 16:15:58] fire: in general, I'll write back soon, the man will contact you soon
[12.08.21 16:24:39] donald: no hurry!
[12.08.21 16:29:54] fire: of course)
[12.08.21 17:50:21] fire: Let's while we wait, let's try to make a report
[12.08.21 17:51:54] fire: I'll let you know what format I use
[12.08.21 17:55:09] fire: Download: https://qaz.im/load/4DNn4r/FBArBD
Delete: https://qaz.im/index.php?a=delete&q=1641461125
[12.08.21 17:55:27] fire: Have a look, if you have any questions, write me.
[12.08.21 17:55:33] fire: Suggestions mb
[12.08.21 17:57:12] fire: If you need any specials, like signalhair, we also provide everything
[12.08.21 17:57:25] donald: ok!
[12.08.21 17:57:28] donald: watching
[12.08.21 17:57:58] fire: Yeah, okay.
[12.08.21 17:59:18] donald: aha! everything seems to make sense!
[12.08.21 17:59:30] donald: is that how a valid target is painted?
[12.08.21 17:59:39] donald: target
[12.08.21 17:59:49] fire: Yes, we get targeting orders
[12.08.21 17:59:58] fire: We pull everything we can
[12.08.21 18:00:35] donald: in pdf is that what you pulled straight from the grid?
[12.08.21 18:00:36] fire: If you have something to add to the report, great - information is never superfluous
[12.08.21 18:00:41] fire: No
[12.08.21 18:00:52] fire: This is what I was gathering on the net
[12.08.21 18:01:06] fire: This is the first stage
[12.08.21 18:01:23] fire: So the biggest emphasis is on people
[12.08.21 18:01:45] fire: Posts, phones, personal data
[12.08.21 18:01:50] donald: I'm a little confused - looks like inside information - subdomains, users, etc.
[12.08.21 18:01:55] fire: Any kind of pressure
[12.08.21 18:02:08] fire: This information is roughly almost from Google
[12.08.21 18:02:16] fire: Ahh
[12.08.21 18:02:47] fire: I get my data from spiderfoot type sites
[12.08.21 18:03:06] fire: shodan and so on
[12.08.21 18:03:46] fire: I'll give you a rough list of resources
[12.08.21 18:03:53] donald: and you just practice on ratheon?)
[12.08.21 18:04:24] donald: 77 pages of OSINT? no way!
[12.08.21 18:04:25] fire: Nah, that's just my report.
[12.08.21 18:04:30] fire: I did.
[12.08.21 18:04:39] fire: I'm just showing you an example.
[12.08.21 18:04:50] fire: Customers are asking for more people
[12.08.21 18:05:23] donald: Got it. Got it.
[12.08.21 18:05:30] donald: just to make sure I get it right
[12.08.21 18:05:33] donald: this is the osint
[12.08.21 18:05:45] donald: which are done before getting into the grid, right?
[12.08.21 18:06:04] fire: Ah.
[12.08.21 18:06:06] fire: Yeah.
[12.08.21 18:06:47] donald: and at what stage will the request come to us? when access appears or even before that?
[12.08.21 18:07:47] donald: just to understand the operation chain
[12.08.21 18:08:57] donald: i.e. with the same ratheon - for example, the bots send you access, url, etc. - you define it as a target and then we get a request for analytics and OSINT? and already after the report is ready, they go online?
[12.08.21 18:09:14] donald: this is a bit new to me
[12.08.21 18:09:31] donald: the revels broke first, then looked at the network, and then went the analysis of what to take from the network
[12.08.21 18:09:38] donald: sometimes even after the network was down
[12.08.21 18:09:45] donald: they just gave all the date downloaded
[12.08.21 18:09:51] fire: look how it happens from my point of view
[12.08.21 18:09:58] donald: and you were told to analyze what to upload to the blog
[12.08.21 18:10:47] fire: Such requests, on external osint - they come before the hack
[12.08.21 18:11:22] fire: we collect information, a bit by network, by people
[12.08.21 18:11:53] donald: okay.
[12.08.21 18:12:28] fire: i.e. contacts, emails, links
[12.08.21 18:12:47] fire: Anything that could get them malware through spam, for example
[12.08.21 18:13:22] fire: usually it's the top people, about 10 from IT, about 15 from the staff
[12.08.21 18:13:40] fire: mostly women, they are more trusting
[12.08.21 18:13:54] fire: this report goes to adverts
[12.08.21 18:14:06] fire: who process people and break the net
[12.08.21 18:14:20] fire: and then our main work begins
[12.08.21 18:14:32] fire: chatting with target and extracting money
[12.08.21 18:15:07] fire: respectively, processing their data, looking for something to push
[12.08.21 18:15:22] fire: financial records, dirt, personal data
[12.08.21 18:16:11] fire: Well, and the negotiations themselves, that's mostly how I work now
[12.08.21 18:16:21] donald: got it!
[12.08.21 18:16:37] fire: I currently receive 1 percent of the ransom amount
[12.08.21 18:16:46] donald: shit, any chance to negotiate with ratheon?))
[12.08.21 18:16:53] donald: I'm really excited about this.)
[12.08.21 18:16:56] fire: manky said if we work well together, he'll give me a raise
[12.08.21 18:17:00] fire: per person
[12.08.21 18:17:13] fire: rateon isn't processed yet probably
[12.08.21 18:17:30] fire: I have transam trucks in the works now
[12.08.21 18:17:46] fire: rater yes, very fat
[12.08.21 18:18:03] fire: you can yank 5-10 million off them easy
[12.08.21 18:18:28] donald: For me there is no question about money - I've already told the interviewer that I'm ready to start working at least for experience. If I show myself, then we will raise the issue of money)).
[12.08.21 18:18:59] fire: you should not forget about the motivation, it is the most pleasant bonus to the experience
[12.08.21 18:19:06] fire: ))
[12.08.21 18:19:12] donald: absolutely!
[12.08.21 18:19:27] fire: i finished my firm the other day, 1.5k shakedown
[12.08.21 18:19:49] fire: 24 hours later I got my payout
[12.08.21 18:19:59] fire: tasty)
[12.08.21 18:20:55] fire: look, I started the same way, with osint
[12.08.21 18:21:04] fire: so all ways are open)
[12.08.21 18:21:22] fire: how's your English, by the way?
[12.08.21 18:21:30] donald: perfect.)
[12.08.21 18:21:36] fire: super.
[12.08.21 18:21:55] fire: I'm a professional translator too.)
[12.08.21 18:22:09] fire: we have a department called
[12.08.21 18:22:26] fire: they can bring a person to orgasm or to a heart attack
[12.08.21 18:22:33] fire: it depends on the purpose)
[12.08.21 18:23:04] fire: so when processing companies, at the stage after hacking, you can always call
[12.08.21 18:23:18] fire: we have a goal now to bring down a good working team
[12.08.21 18:23:28] fire: we're all new here
[12.08.21 18:23:50] fire: and get knowledge and profits
[12.08.21 18:23:52] fire: ))
[12.08.21 18:23:53] donald: we can switch to english
[12.08.21 18:23:59] donald: if you want)
[12.08.21 18:23:59] fire: np
[12.08.21 18:24:10] donald: Excellent :-)
[12.08.21 18:24:18] fire: to be honest, it doesnt matter at all
[12.08.21 18:25:16] fire: in fact, it's not so important in what language we communicate with each other)
[12.08.21 18:25:26] donald: from my experience, the target is more negotiable when you communicate in clear English
[12.08.21 18:25:36] fire: that's right.
[12.08.21 18:25:39] donald: somehow, they feel that you mean business
[12.08.21 18:26:31] fire: from my experience, targets are much more negotiable if our position in the dialogue is strict
[12.08.21 18:26:39] fire: even harsh maybe
[12.08.21 18:26:52] donald: true true true
[12.08.21 18:27:13] fire: we are gansters here, and we decide what to do :)
[12.08.21 18:28:10] donald: I knew a guy who used to work from Ryuk (at least that's what he told me) and they only negotiated in a very concise form - like "yes" and "no". When the victim was trying to be eloquent and talkative there just kept replying with a couple of words
[12.08.21 18:29:19] donald: Can you pls send me the list of tools you guys using for OSING/network scanning?
[12.08.21 18:29:59] fire: I am not so concise, but important part of the discussion is to press, press, and press
[12.08.21 18:30:06] fire: sure, wait a minute please.
[12.08.21 18:32:26] donald: "I am not so concise, but important part of the discussion is to press, press, and press" - everybody has their own style, obviously there is no right way. It will be a long and a fun journey, I feel. Now they create entire cyber negotiation divisions to talk to us, LOL. Ares - The XSS admin, even once said - if you see an American IT company with a job listing called "ransomware negotiator" you start to realize how surreal the world became!
[12.08.21 18:33:00] fire: haha, that's right XD
[12.08.21 18:33:30] fire: here are two files, I've prepared them for my dept
[12.08.21 18:34:48] donald: how many people are there in the analysis team (should we rather call it the Intel Team?), besides you and me, btw?

[12.08.21 18:37:00] donald: Wow! I love the tools!
[12.08.21 18:37:02] donald: thank you!
[12.08.21 18:37:38] fire: fine) u r welcome :)
[12.08.21 18:38:27] fire: today or tomorrow I'll give you more search chips
[12.08.21 18:38:31] fire: paid
[12.08.21 18:38:45] donald: " we are just beginning this branch " that's great - maybe in the future we can even do other stuff, like counterntel - you know to keep idots like m1geelka as far as possible
[12.08.21 18:38:57] donald: Great!
[12.08.21 18:39:14] donald: dmitry - nice utility
[12.08.21 18:39:28] fire: yes, the fact that we are the first on the aspen in the team - gives a lot of opportunities
[12.08.21 18:42:04] donald: 100%
[12.08.21 18:42:56] donald: all modern ransom, IMHO went with analytics. When they figured out not just how to break, but how to involve all the social aspects - money, courts, reputation
[12.08.21 18:43:06] donald: that was essentially the breakthrough.
[12.08.21 18:43:20] fire: yes, that's why we're here)
[12.08.21 18:43:23] donald: without it, we would've been breaking 700 bucks
[12.08.21 18:43:30] fire: Aah!
[12.08.21 18:43:32] fire: yeah)
[12.08.21 18:43:48] fire: the firm's in the works
[12.08.21 18:44:01] fire: that didn't break, they got carbon black
[12.08.21 18:44:11] fire: but they got 200gb of information
[12.08.21 18:44:26] fire: the goal is to sell them their own info
[12.08.21 18:44:36] fire: and nonproliferation guarantees
[12.08.21 18:45:04] fire: I'm poking around their data
[12.08.21 18:45:41] donald: oh man, yeah, carbon black is trouble)
[12.08.21 18:45:50] fire: Mm-hmm.)
[12.08.21 18:46:14] donald: and how did you get the data in the end?
[12.08.21 18:46:36] donald: what country, if yusa - what state, by the way?
[12.08.21 18:46:47] donald: there could be some pretty big loopholes here.
[12.08.21 18:46:52] donald: by class-action lawsuit
[12.08.21 18:47:05] donald: they fear it like the plague
[12.08.21 18:47:07] fire: get caught in the net
[12.08.21 18:47:18] fire: data was leaked
[12.08.21 18:47:23] fire: the locker didn't work
[12.08.21 18:47:29] donald: ah, at least that's it.
[12.08.21 18:47:30] fire: because of the carbon
[12.08.21 18:47:33] donald: Consider it a 90% success.
[12.08.21 18:47:47] fire: I'll tell you right now.
[12.08.21 18:49:43] fire: kansas texas florida
[12.08.21 18:49:53] donald: 1 sec.
[12.08.21 18:50:05] fire: it's the logisticians
[12.08.21 18:50:12] donald: texas is good
[12.08.21 18:50:35] fire: you are aware of the legal intricacies, am I right?
[12.08.21 18:51:21] donald: yes.
[12.08.21 18:51:28] fire: super.
[12.08.21 18:51:34] donald: that's actually my thing.)
[12.08.21 18:51:52] fire: me and Advert were just talking about how we need a lawyer on our team)
[12.08.21 18:51:56] fire: fire
[12.08.21 18:54:39] donald: you know, any negotiation essentially comes down to calling red red red, green green, cold cold cold, etc.-in our case, calling things by their proper names-the ransom is always less than the cost they'll spend to sort out the half-affairs. ALWAYS. And they know this, but what they often don't know is that we know it too. And that's where the two secret components come in - laws and reputational risks.
[12.08.21 18:57:09] fire: Yes, it's clear
[12.08.21 18:59:17] fire: I just don't have enough knowledge of state laws
[12.08.21 18:59:34] fire: and now it's really coming together
[12.08.21 19:04:51] donald: I'm looking at it right now
[12.08.21 19:04:54] donald: as we speak
[12.08.21 19:04:59] donald: what's up in texas
[12.08.21 19:06:00] donald: The Deceptive Trade Practices Act
There's a thing called the Deceptive Trade Practices Act that says that if they said that the data of the customer-loggers was safe, but they ended up stealing it, it's like deception.
[12.08.21 19:06:17] donald: it's unlikely we'll win in court, but we can scare them)
[12.08.21 19:06:36] fire: well, we won't go to court)
[12.08.21 19:06:56] fire: got it, I'll add it to the negotiations
[12.08.21 19:07:24] fire: great move.
[12.08.21 19:09:08] donald: one more thing
https://www.bbb.org/process-of-complaints-and-reviews/complaints

These guys take anonymous complaints - and if the case passes inspection, then they give a rating, and that rating is very important, and then you can't get away with it if you don't get on the page
[12.08.21 19:09:33] fire: ++++
[12.08.21 19:09:34] donald: https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/BC/htm/BC.17.htm here is the Texas supplier protection law

[12.08.21 19:09:55] fire: super
[12.08.21 19:10:16] fire: then make a firm, it usually takes me a couple of days for one

[12.08.21 19:39:29] fire: let's see the other parts
[12.08.21 19:41:46] donald: listen
[12.08.21 19:41:53] donald: I don't want to pry
[12.08.21 19:42:00] donald: but why this office?
[12.08.21 19:42:06] donald: they have nothing to pay for.)
[12.08.21 19:42:09] fire: honestly - I do not know)
[12.08.21 19:42:30] fire: advert decided what they need)
[12.08.21 19:43:09] donald: interesting thing)
[12.08.21 19:43:16] donald: okay, it's their right.)
[12.08.21 19:43:31] fire: yes)
[12.08.21 19:45:01] fire: i think it's more likely they want to reach the partners through them
[12.08.21 19:45:14] donald: yeah, that's what I thought.
[12.08.21 19:46:03] donald: nice scheme
[12.08.21 19:46:06] fire: https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:199203&datastreamId=FULL-TEXT.PDF
[12.08.21 19:46:17] fire: plus they're well-funded
[12.08.21 19:46:30] fire: no turnover, but the ventures are ok
[12.08.21 19:47:48] donald: accepted
[12.08.21 19:48:23] fire: simple enough
[12.08.21 19:48:32] fire: no daughters nothing
[12.08.21 19:48:45] fire: significant
[12.08.21 19:49:43] fire: but their advisor, johnathan cross works for the government
[12.08.21 19:49:58] fire: Local Government Association
[12.08.21 19:50:36] fire: that's more interesting.)
[12.08.21 19:52:07] donald: that's who pours the money
[12.08.21 19:52:14] donald: https://seekingalpha.com/search?q=UK%20Biobank&tab=headlines
[12.08.21 19:52:25] donald: at least publicly
[12.08.21 19:53:46] fire: also a variant)
[12.08.21 19:54:30] fire: plus I think the trust to them is serious
[12.08.21 19:54:42] fire: so it's a normal topic for investors
[12.08.21 19:55:30] donald: but their advisor, johnathan tross works for the government
Local Government Association

woo
[12.08.21 19:55:33] donald: that's the topic!
[12.08.21 19:55:43] donald: speaking of investors
[12.08.21 19:56:02] donald: for negotiations - always say that we won't just release the data
[12.08.21 19:56:08] donald: we'll send a link to them to investors
[12.08.21 19:56:14] fire: yes, of course.
[12.08.21 19:56:18] donald: and in the same message a list of just emails
[12.08.21 19:56:18] fire: and clients
[12.08.21 19:56:22] donald: 100% working
[12.08.21 19:56:35] donald: they usually don't care about customers, but investors freak them out
[12.08.21 19:56:42] fire: and if there's also clients' data, it's a real treat
[12.08.21 19:56:45] fire: ahah
[12.08.21 19:57:11] fire: yes, but venture capital firms have big investors
[12.08.21 19:57:11] fire: not everywhere
[12.08.21 19:59:44] donald: smaller investors are actually more reactive
[12.08.21 20:00:32] donald: the big ones are diversifying - they invest into a hundred companies, and they don't really care if each of them pays off - because they already have a critical mass just from the number of investments
[12.08.21 20:00:51] donald: but the smaller ones are just careful to make sure there are no failures
[12.08.21 20:00:52] fire: got it, didn't think so
[12.08.21 20:01:19] fire: thanks for the tip.)
[12.08.21 20:03:04] donald: no problem)
[12.08.21 21 21:45:51] donald: Listen, I started working, and I got some ideas for optimization. For example - the adverts are obviously only using some of the information that's in the report, right? For example - it's clear that the more people, the better, but do we need detailed data on all people? Wouldn't it be easier to send the adverts a list with emails, and if they need a custom query for a specific person - make it based on the circumstances. And the time freed up, for example, to spend on other companies. Ideally, they should make a mini-questionnaire for adverts - what they use and what they ignore
[12.08.21 21:46:36] donald: the same goes for subdomains
[12.08.21 21:48:01] donald: just, if they're not using additional data anyway, you could focus on other aspects - the same legal or financial and reputational
[12.08.21 21:54:06] donald: I'll leave my thoughts out loud for now. It seems to me that we need to maximize the uniqueness of our actions - it's not like we're just doing abstract asinine - what makes us special is that we understand the whole case life cycle and we understand what adverts do with the information. And maximum efficiency is born when we have a clear net connection of our axint and actions of adverts
[12.08.21 21:54:42] fire: yes
[12.08.21 21:54:47] fire: well, look.
[12.08.21 21:55:00] fire: on network information I'll ask
[12.08.21 21:55:25] fire: and for people - basically, we need emails, phone numbers, and position
[12.08.21 21:56:06] donald: no questions about people
[12.08.21 21:56:07] fire: and a name of course)
[12.08.21 21:56:13] donald: except maybe the number of phones
[12.08.21 21:56:48] fire: phones are also controversial, for example, signalhair says that there is a work number, and that there is a personal one
[12.08.21 21:57:02] fire: so it's probably better to list
[12.08.21 21:57:14] fire: about the networks - I'll ask
[12.08.21 21:57:37] fire: honestly - not really see the point in ssl certificates
[12.08.21 21:58:03] fire: it is clear that it takes little time to get a report from Dimitri, we leave it
[12.08.21 21:58:21] fire: well, considering I'm cutting some info from it
[12.08.21 21:58:39] fire: subdomains - also done by couple of clicks
[12.08.21 21:58:47] fire: what else do we have there?
[12.08.21 21:59:22] donald: that's about it.
[12.08.21 21:59:25] donald: about people I agree
[12.08.21 21:59:31] donald: it's always better to be reassured
[12.08.21 21:59:41] fire: let's remove certificates from the report
[12.08.21 22:00:05] fire: yes, you don't need them
[12.08.21 22:00:30] fire: about people - leave contacts and email
[12.08.21 22:00:37] fire: more info on request
[12.08.21 22:01:31] fire: tomorrow I'll ask hells what exactly they need to see
[12.08.21 22:01:37] fire: in reports
[12.08.21 22:01:59] fire: and we will depend on it
[12.08.21 22:02:27] fire: I just give reports, they always say they're great)
[12.08.21 22:02:42] fire: find out what you have to add, what you have to remove
[12.08.21 22:04:10] donald: exactly
[12.08.21 22:04:18] donald: Otherwise we'll be digging up all the dirt
[12.08.21 22:04:28] donald: and the advert will end up with a single imeffl
[12.08.21 22:04:38] donald: And that way you can dig more vendors for example
[12.08.21 22:04:52] donald: and see the loopholes in the supply chain that others didn't notice
[12.08.21 22:05:02] donald: I just turn in reports, they always say they're great)
[12.08.21 22:05:11] donald: yes, it's a problem when the work is done well
[12.08.21 22:05:24] donald: always
[12.08.21 22:05:52] donald: i suggest you just send them all a questionnaire in the style of the top 10 things that are most important to you when starting to develop a target
[12.08.21 22:06:10] donald: the best combat cohesion so to speak)
[12.08.21 22:10:25] fire: ++
[12.08.21 22:10:38] donald: by the way - for yusa
[12.08.21 22:10:41] fire: accepted, will do tomorrow
[12.08.21 22:10:42] donald: https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/entitysearch/namesearch.aspx
[12.08.21 22:10:49] donald: very useful thing
[12.08.21 22:11:20] donald: Delaware has very peculiar tax laws and the state economic court there is 99% in favor of corporations
[12.08.21 22:11:38] donald: As a result, almost all American companies are incorporated in Delaware
[12.08.21 22:11:46] donald: either by primary or secondary registration
[12.08.21 22:12:14] donald: So if you search for a U.S. company here - you get a lot of data on registration with a very high degree of probability
[12.08.21 22:12:45] fire: yes, I've already checked the Raytheon.
[12.08.21 22:13:07] donald: in general, if the idea with the analytics team is to go forward, we should get a single, but cool platform for everything
[12.08.21 22:13:13] donald: I personally am a Factiva fan
[12.08.21 22:13:21] donald: but lexis nexis is good too
[12.08.21 22:13:35] fire: got it
[12.08.21 22:13:40] fire: not a problem
[12.08.21 22:13:51] fire: look at it tomorrow, I'll send you a request
[12.08.21 22:14:24] fire: let's go like this
[12.08.21 22:14:24] fire: tomorrow we'll make a list of what we want
[12.08.21 22:14:40] fire: and I'll send it
[12.08.21 22:14:57] fire: all in all, nobody holds us back in our desires
[12.08.21 22:15:05] fire: within reasonable limits, of course)
[12.08.21 22:15:24] donald: by the way, if you found in the delaware, that they have a second registration in another state - search the same for this state NameState+Division of Corporations
[12.08.21 22:15:42] donald: yeah! got it!
[12.08.21 22:15:44] donald: okay.
[12.08.21 22:16:57] donald: also - if companies are international or out of the English-speaking world
[12.08.21 22:17:03] donald: the entire Middle East is covered here
[12.08.21 22:17:05] donald: https://www.zawya.com/mena/en/
[12.08.21 22:17:13] donald: Up to and including
[12.08.21 22:17:24] donald: we omit CIS for obvious reasons
[12.08.21 22:17:31] donald: in Asia we have to search
[12.08.21 22:17:38] fire: And we'll have to make this list as well.
[12.08.21 22:17:46] fire: international are
[12.08.21 22:17:54] fire: I did honeywell
[12.08.21 22:18:09] donald: yes
[12.08.21 22:18:15] donald: Speaking of international.
[12.08.21 22:18:16] donald: https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/
[12.08.21 22:18:24] donald: you can check with them
[12.08.21 22:18:35] donald: there's often ownership
[12.08.21 22:18:50] fire: ++
[12.08.21 22:19:30] fire: great
[12.08.21 22:19:54] donald: if you find something from them, it's the juice - they're offshore and everything. 99% it's all perfectly legal, clean offshore - it's just easier with taxes, but it's clear that when we're talking about negotiations and you bring there panama paers it all changes colors)))
[12.08.21 22:19:58] fire: a peculiar bible of asyanthus is formed with us)
[12.08.21 22:20:03] donald: aha!
[12.08.21 22:20:19] fire: super
[12.08.21 22:20:19] fire: let's do it.
[12.08.21 22:20:33] fire: I'll make a full pdf with links
[12.08.21 22:20:45] fire: for our department
[12.08.21 22:21:16] fire: tools, resources
[12.08.21 22:21:16] fire: templates
[12.08.21 22:22:08] donald: aha!
[12.08.21 22:25:18] fire: I'm sleeping for today
[12.08.21 22:25:18] fire: see you tomorrow!
[12.08.21 22:25:18] fire: thanks for productive work and ideas!
[12.08.21 22:25:52] donald: no problem! I'll work on my report now!
[12.08.21 22:25:58] donald: for BIOBANK JCC
[12.08.21 22:26:06] fire: Got it.
[12.08.21 22:28:47] donald: one last thing - before I forget. Very often in the West corporations are obliged to present all securities on the so-called minutes - these are central commissions to the state for public access. For example in the U.S. it is done through the SEC or the division of corporations. In the UK it's done through Companies House. And you can look there in Filings all list of changes - it's important because very often it says who was named manager, co-owner, secondary director, etc., and this is more reliable information than the same linkedin
[12.08.21 22:29:23] fire: accepted
[12.08.21 22:30:12] fire: that's it, we'll work it out tomorrow and roll out the guides by monday
[13.08.21 15:04:27] fire: hi_)

[13.08.21 15:11:09] donald: finishing draft for uk biobank

[13.08.21 15:11:21] fire: ++
[13.08.21 15:11:23] fire: great)
[13.08.21 15:14:30] donald: what's the second chat?
[13.08.21 15:14:51] fire: that's where we work by firms

[08.13.21 21:31:25] donald: Okay, sorry for the delay - I planned to send everything yesterday, but something kept holding me back.

Anyway, for now I've prepared this draft as a basic skeleton. Let's try to give it to the adverts and see if this information is enough for them, and if they want something extra, I'll add it right away.

[13.08.21 21:32:06] donald: in the future you can do such bones in one day for speed
[13.08.21 21:32:54] fire: accepted
[13.08.21 21:33:03] fire: I'll pick it up tomorrow
[13.08.21 21:33:16] fire: all off today
[13.08.21 21:33:18] donald: understood
[13.08.21 21:34:30] fire: good
[13.08.21 22:49:37] donald: Ooh! look what I found - it's for you to read in the morning for your Texas-Florida logisticians
[13.08.21 22:49:38] donald: https://statescoop.com/data-breach-exposes-nearly-28-million-texas-drivers-records/
[08/13/1921 22:50:21] donald: The company is offering one year of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services to victims. It's also reported the incident to Texas authorities, including the state Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Public Safety and Office of the Attorney General.

We didn't get it right, and now we have to fuck around for a year, catching leaked data.
[13.08.21 23:44:33] donald: Now to be more specific.

Three things I see in their grid

1. They have a GDPR file - they seem to claim to be GDPR compliant - with all that implies

2. there are folders on drivers promotions and non-promotions, which is a good thing. Right now the public is furious with Amazon and how Amazon doesn't promote workers and doesn't pay them well, etc. We can press them on the fact that we will leak all their corporate surveillance policies to these guys - https://www.aclu.org/
We can also write a letter to the Teamsters Union, one of the most powerful pro-union organizations in the country. Let's also say that you can write to the EEOC, and to your local congressman - it's a very common story. When concerned citizens write to their congressman about a workers' issue.

3. Most importantly, I see their HR and litigations, where there is a bunch of internal correspondence between employees and each other. I haven't gotten into it yet, but obviously someone said something inappropriate and it happened. Looks like they had a trial and stuff. Let's say that we will leak all your litigation correspondence, and then your own employees, participants in that trial will sue you for this - because their personal correspondence attached to the official court case leaked into the network.

Z.I. Apparently they are insured by cyber insurance - it's good for ransom
[14.08.21 00:16:57] donald: There's another thought I wanted to discuss. What do you think about Saint Augustine's University?
[14.08.21 09:31:55] fire: haven't looked at it yet
[14.08.21 09:32:07] fire: if I'm working at the weekend, then it's closer to the evening
[14.08.21 09:32:13] fire: on logisticians
[14.08.21 13:18:29] fire: on the spot?
[14.08.21 13:58:31] donald: hi.
[14.08.21 13:58:32] donald: here
[14.08.21 14:00:30] fire: wanted to know about the folder
[14.08.21 14:00:36] fire: you put together
[14.08.21 14:00:41] fire: on duke
[14.08.21 14:00:47] donald: yeah
[14.08.21 14:02:40] fire: look
[14.08.21 14:03:04] fire: you sampled the files to send them
[14.08.21 14:03:12] donald: okay.
[14.08.21 14:03:13] donald: *yes
[14.08.21 14:03:28] fire: what should I throw to make them understand that it's dangerous not to pay?
[14.08.21 14:03:34] fire: and approximate risks
[14.08.21 14:03:44] fire: I'll draw up a text and text them back
[14.08.21 14:03:55] donald: insurance - litigation claims
[14.08.21 14:04:01] donald: that's the coolest thing I found.
[14.08.21 14:04:08] donald: there - damage claims - in the same folder
[14.08.21 14:04:26] donald: how the production workers broke something, etc.
[14.08.21 14:04:29] donald: that's the most important thing
[14.08.21 14:05:37] donald: The second most important thing - the second run - audit, tax, finance - makes them understand that we understand their accounting and correspondence, understand their work structure, etc. And of course lets them know that we're everywhere - not just in the file))
[14.08.21 14:06:29] donald: the rest - the third stage - there's just a slicing of interesting documents to show them that we see the whole network, all the folders and all aspects of their work - it's meant to alleviate doubt that we took some documents and try to pretend that we stole 300gb
[14.08.21 14:09:17] donald: Oh yeah, I also put their risk management policies in there - you can put that in the third step as well. The idea is that the policies in place - that is, they've committed to data protection and privacy, but they haven't prevented an attack.
[14.08.21 14:09:50] fire: do you think to divide into stages?
[14.08.21 14:10:09] fire: maybe now throw them 10 files
[14.08.21 14:10:25] fire: and explain what's what
[14.08.21 14:11:26] donald: I would do so - throw files and that's it
[14.08.21 14:11:35] donald: I'm more for our internal logic
[14.08.21 14:11:56] donald: to maintain a congruent strategy in our negotiations
[14.08.21 14:15:55] fire: got it.
[14.08.21 14:16:26] fire: I'll write it up.
[14.08.21 14:17:36] donald: let me have a look - for experience?
[14.08.21 14:18:17] fire: yeah, sure, I'll duplicate it for you
[14.08.21 14:18:44] donald: thanks.)
[14.08.21 15:14:26] donald: i'll be gone about an hour before the end of the day - is that ok?
[14.08.21 15:14:33] donald: I'll be there in the morning, Moscow time.
[14.08.21 15:14:41] donald: do you have any more tasks for me today?
[14.08.21 15:14:49] donald: I can change something in my schedule
[14.08.21 16:16:30] fire: no, that's it for today
[14.08.21 16:16:33] fire: I'll send you the text
[14.08.21 16:25:01] fire: Okay. For you to understand all the seriousness of the situation, we want to clarify something.

We have thoroughly examined the information we got from your network. During this investigation, very sensitive files were found. We'll give you some examples and attach several files to this chat.

1) There are litigation claims in the insurance catalog. We think you understand that publishing this data will result in serious reputational and financial losses.
2) All your financial documentation is also uploaded to our servers. Consequently, we know much about your revenues and loans so you can forget about negotiation. We said our offer.
3) Also, we read your risk management policies and know that information leaking will result in hundreds of court claims.

Just penalties for leaking personal data will exceed our offer ten times.
We'll give you some examples:
1. https://www.zdnet.com/article/easyjet-faces-18-billion-class-action-lawsuit-over-data-breach/
2. https://www.businessinsider.com/hm-fined-41-million-for-staff-privacy-breaches-in-germany-2020-10

So, we will be waiting for your decision by Monday. If you choose to ignore us or waste our time, the ransom amount will be raised and a small part of the data will b3e published.
[8/15/1921 15:55:50] donald: That's it, I'm reading!
[8/15/1921 15:55:54] donald: went out for family stuff - now here - next 12 hours are at your disposal
[15.08.21 16:40:03] fire: hi!)
[15.08.21 16:40:43] fire: it's quiet now, tomorrow's a very busy day)
[15.08.21 17:17:29] donald: ok!
[16.08.21 13:52:57] donald: you know the enigma from the main chat room?
[16.08.21 13:53:07] donald: he has an interesting perspective
[16.08.21 13:55:04] fire: yes
[16.08.21 13:55:09] fire: he hired me)
[16.08.21 13:55:14] fire: mayor
[16.08.21 13:55:18] donald: ah, okay.)
[16.08.21 13:55:33] fire: yes, he's pulling for firms by horizontal displacement
[16.08.21 13:55:44] fire: we should work on this idea
[16.08.21 13:55:48] donald: ugh, okay)) I'm just a little paranoid sometimes
[16.08.21 13:55:58] fire: plan?)
[16.08.21 13:56:12] donald: what kind of people are looking for
[16.08.21 13:56:17] fire: you and I also have a special mission
we'll have to write a manual
[16.08.21 13:56:21] fire: ahah
[16.08.21 13:56:27] fire: Nah, we're all friends here
[16.08.21 13:56:36] fire: we're gonna get the cases
[16.08.21 13:56:41] fire: and let's go
[16.08.21 13:56:58] fire: while 5 companies are working, my head is not full of methodics)
[16.08.21 14:07:57] donald: I throw the idea
[16.08.21 14:08:00] donald: for methodologists
[16.08.21 14:08:02] donald: writing it down
[16.08.21 14:08:31] fire: yeah, me too.)
[16.08.21 14:08:40] fire: so I guess there won't be any problem
[16.08.21 15:08:10] donald: ok!
[16.08.21 15:12:13] donald: I already said about this enigma - in general, my idea is to have a methodology to go through the whole case life cycle. here's how
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_cycle

Only our life cycle is tied to the network
1. victim selection analytics and attack methodology
2. network and internal file analysis
3. Negotiation
It turns out the sequence is...
[16.08.21 15:13:19] fire: yes, that's what we'll do
[16.08.21 15:13:27] fire: and we'll describe each stage
[16.08.21 15:13:48] donald: the main thing here is not to get lost
[16.08.21 15:26:24] fire: ++
[16.08.21 16:32:36] donald: do you call through Asterisk, by the way?
[16.08.21 16:38:56] fire: I don't know, frankly
[16.08.21 16:39:14] fire: I know we had a whole team calling
[19.08.21 16:55:14] donald: [ ](https://chat.mydatanalys.com/direct/CvtewuA4CTuPsNJwckTnaiuh2TzEPNwgaY?msg=XHhAAmg3Y4s8xJ86D) here, found it
[19.08.21 16:56:23] donald: Okay, sorry for the delay - I planned to send everything yesterday, but something kept holding me back.

Anyway, for now I've prepared this draft as a basic skeleton. Let's try to give it to the adverts and see if this information is enough for them, and if they want something extra, I'll add it right away.
