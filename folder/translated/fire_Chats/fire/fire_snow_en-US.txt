[19.10.21 13:01:29] snow: Agreed
[19.10.21 13:04:01] fire: gut)
[28.10.21 12:29:21] snow: Hi, I want to ask you a question about information search methods, if you don't mind. Is it possible to make contact with people relevant to the purpose of the research? Like can I create a legend, well, and then write to one of the developers of the same Tox.chat to get something out...
[28.10.21 12:30:06] fire: interesting idea
[28.10.21 12:30:29] fire: you can, of course, industrial espionage is a big array in asynth
[28.10.21 12:30:44] fire: but you should understand that protection should be good too)
[28.10.21 12:31:21] snow: protection in what way?) so they would not guess that we dig?
[28.10.21 12:32:13] fire: Mm-hmm.)
[28.10.21 12:32:21] fire: and the left account)
[28.10.21 12:33:21] snow: ok, I was thinking about it too. Anyway, if I figure out how to do it, I'll write to you first
[28.10.21 12:33:47] fire: accepted
[28.10.21 12:33:54] fire: great)
[28.10.21 12:34:06] snow: )
[30.10.21 19:01:25] snow: Hi! If the topic with Tox is still relevant, I suggest to buy a GitHub account (500p from mipped.com dude - https://mipped.com/f/threads/prodam-akkaunty-github.88373/ ), under it take some repositories to work on Tox.chat on GitHub and write to Tox main developer (it seems irungento) and everyone, who theoretically can show activity to the project.

You can write asking to describe the main "holes" in the development of Tox.Chat like for the case. If it works, then you can ask in more detail who is now engaged in the project (ostensibly to join forces). Who, who, and the main developer may know who is interested in it now.

Security related actions:
On mipped, sign up via anonymous email (I have such a valid email at tutanota.com). You need this to email the seller of the GitHub account.
All transitions via tor

What to write approximately:
Hey! My name is Ferr√©ol, I am a programmer in a French IT company. I believe in the Tox project because I feel it is the future of anonymity on the Internet. Usually I work with C# and C++, so how can I help someone who is working on Tox.chat? Can you tell me someone who is actively working on the project right now? thx

[02.11.21 12:52:23] fire: major asked me to do it by friday
[02.11.21 12:54:30] snow: ok!
[05.11.21 08:36:28] snow: Hi) I'm just checking the translation before sending the text and came across a controversial moment - in English there is a term "stream" and there is a term "thread". In Russian only one word "stream" is used for both terms.

These are different concepts, and I don't understand what kind of flow the text is talking about (here's a clipping):
The technique is similar to Process doppelganging:
- real program text is written to a file and CreateProcess is run
- text is overwritten with noise (e.g. host program text) before real thread is started
- uses race condition in Windows Defender to feed it with fake program text
[05.11.21 08:41:26] snow: Can you give me a hint?) Stream is just a sequence of text (code) which receives data and which is output somewhere in a file or console, Fred is part of the process and serves to process services os
[05.11.21 09:09:53] fire: Hi)
[05.11.21 09:10:02] fire: I'll figure it out in the evening, I'm not home yet

[05.11.21 14:20:11] fire: took a look, gave it to the major for clarification
[05.11.21 14:20:36] snow: most likely, all the same stream), but just in case.)
[05.11.21 14:20:39] snow: Thank you.
[05.11.21 14:21:22] fire: I would have written a thread by the way.
[05.11.21 14:21:46] snow: hmm, okay, why?
[05.11.21 14:21:51] fire: that's the term I remember using for streaming data
[05.11.21 14:22:19] fire: at least that's how it is in my translations from English
[05.11.21 14:25:38] snow: well, i've decided that stream, just because it fits better (it's about code), while thread is used with multi-thread (when speaking about multithreaded os systems)
[05.11.21 14:26:19] snow: awaiting the major's answer)
[05.11.21 14:26:56] fire: Yep.)
