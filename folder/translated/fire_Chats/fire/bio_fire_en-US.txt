[05.11.21 20:40:15] bio: Kay we have been damage-assessing all day long. We understand that you are serious business partners.
To complete the picture, you might have of us, I would like to share the following: we are a medium-sized trading company specialized in men's fashion. We have been hit hard by Covid-19. Our stores have been closed with running operating costs at the same time. Our financial situation is very bad. We receive support loans from KfW and are subject to their strict terms and conditions. It is important for us to get back our data. Publishing our data seems not so bad to us because we think that there is no crucial data on the effected servers. If this assessment is wrong, please let us know.We want to negotiate with you. However, we cannot afford the money you demand.
[05.11.21 20:41:56] bio: I think it's not worth saying that we'll put them out if they don't pay. But I think to write that there are 6 days left, after that the amount will double, and we will sell your data anyway in the shadow segment. But I looked there data, really almost nothing valuable, one crap, and 16-19 years
[05.11.21 20:42:16] bio: the only thing they have is like their cards, like passports and DL like
[05.11.21 20:42:22] bio: nothing of value

[05.11.21 21:00:55] fire: sec
[05.11.21 21:02:23] fire: You probably don't understand the risks of publishing your entire tree of files.
Just penalties for leaking personal data will exceed this amount ten times.
We'll give you some examples:
1. https://www.zdnet.com/article/easyjet-faces-18-billion-class-action-lawsuit-over-data-breach/
2. https://www.businessinsider.com/hm-fined-41-million-for-staff-privacy-breaches-in-germany-2020-10
However, we are ready to offer you the small discount. Let's agree on AMOUNT, but you must send a payment in 48 hours; after this price will return to AMOUNT NOW.
It is your best chance to take a right decision.
[05.11.21 21:02:39] fire: the same

[05.11.21 21:03:12] fire: ok)
[11.05.21:04:09] fire: Let me enlighten you on some tech stuff, since IT management is clearly not your thing (considering that you've already screwed up). In this day and age, data parsing is being done extremely easily. You run a couple basic scripts and get all the nice neat information on any name, content number, emails, and phone which is there in the 100GB of your files. And there are plenty - because when we download your files we do not do exfiltration randomly but with a targeted selection: claims, complains, litigation, employee injuries, HR complains, COVID-19 safety violations, etc.
In any case, what it means to you is that literally every person mentioned in the files will get notified (thanks to automatic email sending technologies) about the scope of your breach and about how much of THEIR personal, private, corporate, contractual, legal, and business information is now available for everyone. For this situation we have also compiled a set of links which help customers whose data was exposed to navigate their rights of signing a class-action lawsuit for data exposure and loss, as well as breach of contractual obligations regarding privacy. And we also provide an extended comment on how the data leak affects their security as no anybody on the darknet can exploit their personal and business info.
In addition to this, the link to our blog and files will be sent to the local and broad media (again, we have all the contact lists prepared and set in advance - you are not the first smart-ass-we-will-not-pay case in out career), local congressmen for the states in which you operate, the Better Business Bureau, state Division of Corporations, IRS (since we have your taxes), FDA (since we have your product lines and complain records), and trade unions. Our newsletter also includes all the political guys like the ACLU who may be very interested in looking at your HR files and how you treat your employees in the times of COVID (hint - you don't really shy like a diamond in this). Since we already did all the analysis of your files in order to get proper negotiations with you, it will require us only another 10-15 minutes to get this all set going.
At this point you can tell to yourself "well, why would they do all this instead of accepting our pitiful handout of 95k?" Well if you read the news - you may know that we lock some systems and get tenth of millions of dollars as a result. So losing 100k is not an issue. At the same time, each time somebody refuses to pay we use them as a use-case for our other "clients", who are currently in negotiations, and to whom we, btw, will also send all of your files, as well as network details portraying the scale of your system lock.
So if you don't pay then somebody else will - as they will get convinced by looking at your mistakes.

JVC did not want to pay and now their files are all over the place. Should I explain to you how this works? One word - lawsuits. You expose private data, financial data, legal data, employee data, vendor data, customer data, etc, etc, etc, to everyone who has internet access.
Do you think your clients and employees will be happy about it? Even if they will, the State will not. There is a million regulatory acts and govt bodies that punish for data exposure. And on our side we will make sure to make it as public AF.
Tbh, we would not even need to try that hard, since you live in a world in which corporate lackeys from the media will leach upon any news for weeks, spreading the word about your data leak simply because they have nothing better to do.
So, please, call your C-Suite fat-cat boss, who understands this corporate abyss into which you are heading and who will give us some decent offer.
[05.11.21 22:00:55] fire: Okay.
[05.11.21 22:01:07] bio: good, you can get some from here.
[05.11.21 22:03:22] fire: everything will be here.)
[05.11.21 22:18:36] fire: Seems that you are lying.
You say two opposite statements in several sentences: "our data is not important but we need it back". However, we are not stupid and understand this.

So, I want to clarify something.
I've just checked your data and found a lot of info that is looking not "crucial" for you, but it will be very "crucial" to people who will suffer if data would be published.

Let me enlighten you on some tech stuff, since IT management is clearly not your thing (considering that you've already screwed up). In this day and age, data parsing is being done extremely easily. You run a couple basic scripts and get all the nice neat information on any name, content number, emails, and phone which is there in your files. And there are plenty - because when we download your files we do not do exfiltration randomly but with a targeted selection: claims, complains, litigation, employee injuries, HR complains, COVID-19 safety violations, etc.

In any case, what it means to you is that literally every person mentioned in the files will get notified (thanks to automatic email sending technologies) about the scope of your breach and about how much of THEIR personal, private, corporate, contractual, legal, and business information is now available for everyone. For this situation we have also compiled a set of links which help customers whose data was exposed to navigate their rights of signing a class-action lawsuit for data exposure and loss, as well as breach of contractual obligations regarding privacy. And we also provide an extended comment on how the data leak affects their security as no anybody on the darknet can exploit their personal and business info.

In addition to this, the link to our blog and files will be sent to the local and broad media (again, we have all the contact lists prepared and set in advance - you are not the first smart-ass-we-will-not-pay case in out career), most of trade unions and. KfW! You gave us this info just now, thanks! Oh, they would be happy that their support loans are used by such a liars. Since we already did all the analysis of your files in order to get proper negotiations with you, it will only require us another 10-15 minutes to get this all set going.

Should I explain to you how this works? One word - lawsuits. You expose private data, financial data, legal data, employee data, vendor data, customer data, etc, etc, etc, to everyone who has internet access.
Do you think your clients and employees will be happy about it? Even if they will, the GDPR guys will not. There is a million regulatory acts and govt bodies that punish for data exposure. And on our side we will make sure to make it as public AF.

Just penalties for leaking personal data will ruin your business to the ground.
We'll give you some examples:
1. https://www.zdnet.com/article/easyjet-faces-18-billion-class-action-lawsuit-over-data-breach/
2. https://www.businessinsider.com/hm-fined-41-million-for-staff-privacy-breaches-in-germany-2020-10
Moreover, don't forget about the screenshot with your words:
"Publishing our data seems not so bad to us because we think that there is no crucial data on the effected servers."
Nice, huh?

At this point you can tell to yourself "well, why would they do all this instead of accepting our pitiful handout?" Well if you read the news - you may know that we lock some systems and get tenth of millions of dollars as a result. So losing your amount is not an issue. At the same time, each time somebody refuses to pay we use them as a use-case for our other "clients", who are currently in negotiations, and to whom we, btw, will also send all of your files.

Tbh, we would not even need to try that hard, since you live in a world in which corporate lackeys from the media will leach upon any news for weeks, spreading the word about your data leak simply because they have nothing better to do.
So, please, call your C-Suite fat-cat boss, who understands this corporate abyss into which you are heading and who will give us some decent offer.

So, regarding your last questions sent on the email:

(1) We have moved you to our TOR platform.

(2) We have all the data about which you have already negotiated with Blackmattery team. As we both know, that negotiations stopped on the 12-million payment stage. You said that all funds are sent to the broker already.

To clarify this point, the most important data we got is located in such folders as HR, Accounting, Internal_Audit, etc.

In any case, we have uploaded a part of your data on the hidden blog, so you can check it. Blog will be automatically published after 6.5 days, so we need to finalize a deal as soon as possible.

Here is a link:
