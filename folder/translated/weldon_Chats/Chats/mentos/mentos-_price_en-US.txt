2020-06-21T15:22:25 price -> mentos
antidebug

2020-06-21T15:22:50 price -> mentos
have you encountered fs:[2] and all the other stuff?

2020-06-21T15:23:47 price -> mentos
I seem to be resetting from the ida for this reason

2020-06-21T15:23:48 mentos -> price
I can't remember the name, I don't have Ida now) not even on wirts

2020-06-21T15:24:06 price -> mentos
ok

2020-06-21T15:24:15 price -> mentos
I asked just in case

2020-06-21T15:24:23 mentos -> price
Did you build a new PC?

2020-06-21T15:24:33 price -> mentos
Reviving the walk with gimmicks

2020-06-21T15:24:57 mentos -> price
(really, I don't have id at hand, I can't tell you what I had in there)

2020-06-21T15:25:12 price -> mentos
asks for locales and if russia, ukraine, kazakhstan, armenia and moldavia rumanian and russian immediately kicks out

2020-06-21T15:25:25 price -> mentos
Man with the new

2020-06-21T15:25:33 price -> mentos
pc advance

2020-06-21T15:25:41 price -> mentos
although of course it's an ass.

2020-06-21T15:26:02 mentos -> price
I don't understand, did you buy it or not?

2020-06-21T15:26:06 price -> mentos
I bought the second one for 30K and it was fine

2020-06-21T15:26:31 price -> mentos
and the one I wanted goes for 450K

2020-06-21T15:26:36 price -> mentos
I don't have the time.

2020-06-21T15:27:28 price -> mentos
but here I decided (take your example) why do I need a laptop when I can build a desktop at half the cost of my dream performance

2020-06-21T15:28:04 price -> mentos
Now I want to build an AMD 12 core 128 GB memory for 210K

2020-06-21T15:28:04 price -> mentos
But it's for the new year.

2020-06-21T15:28:05 price -> mentos
right now on credit

2020-06-21T15:28:09 price -> mentos
two even

2020-06-21T15:29:25 mentos -> price
I keep going and going, now I have no time, now I have no money, on Wednesday I had a stroke :-O I almost moved a horse.

2020-06-21T15:29:25 price -> mentos
but realistically two virtual machines run, I only have 10 percent of memory left

2020-06-21T15:29:25 price -> mentos
And everything slows down.

2020-06-21T15:29:40 price -> mentos
What part of the attack?

2020-06-21T15:29:49 price -> mentos
head, heart?

go check https://github.com, it's not letting me in

2020-07-13T08:13:35 mentos -> price
is that our git?

2020-07-13T08:13:41 price -> mentos
like eyes poked out.

2020-07-13T08:13:55 price -> mentos
I called my wife, she has access to it.

2020-07-13T08:14:06 price -> mentos
no it's a common git

2020-07-13T08:14:19 price -> mentos
no need to look anymore, it became clear that this is my problem

2020-07-13T08:14:31 price -> mentos
although I've tried to use the torus as well.

2020-07-13T08:15:02 price -> mentos
And there is a VPN.

2020-07-13T08:15:13 price -> mentos

2020-07-31T13:54:30 price -> mentos
And if it's a paycheck, it hasn't happened yet.

[20.08.2020 19:04:29] <PRICE> not yet, we will
[20.08.2020 19:04:35] <PRICE> so as not to scorch the bot ?

2020-08-21T17:44:23 price -> mentos
I radiate focus and clarity in my negotiations

2020-08-21T17:44:43 price -> mentos
I take such questions as a call to speed up and deepen

2020-08-21T17:45:49 price -> mentos
Stern pays the money and has the right to demand my utmost commitment. I'm allowed to leave if I'm not satisfied with something. And he's allowed to let me go at any time if there's no return.

2020-08-21T17:46:29 price -> mentos
That's why I work hard for days and nights. It's good for me to either show what I can do, or to gain additional knowledge.

2020-08-21T17:47:06 price -> mentos
Since Hof is talking about you, and he's a programmer, does that mean you work in programming?

2020-08-21T17:49:28 price -> mentos
By what criteria can Hof report weak results?

2020-08-21T17:51:23 price -> mentos
I've been put by mushroom to curate, but sometimes Hof flies out unexpectedly and asks what and how-double control. I use these moments something programmatic to ask. To save my research or make sure he doesn't know it either and I learn something new for the office (in a good way)

2020-08-21T17:52:37 price -> mentos
I see that Stern was talking to you after me.

2020-08-21T17:53:03 price -> mentos
So you were delayed like I was. Did you go out on your own or did he start it first?

2020-08-21T17:53:32 price -> mentos
Where did you go quiet?
