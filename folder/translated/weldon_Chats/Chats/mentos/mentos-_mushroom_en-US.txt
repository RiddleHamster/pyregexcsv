hi

2020-07-14T07:58:50 mentos -> mushroom
Did Buza write to you?

2020-07-14T08:09:42 mushroom -> mentos
Wrote it now.

2020-07-14T08:10:53 mushroom -> mentos
You have to move the obfuscation to the new llvm he said.

2020-07-14T08:11:21 mentos -> mushroom
On 10?

2020-07-14T08:11:40 mushroom -> mentos
On the latest release. It's a 10.

2020-07-14T08:12:33 mushroom -> mentos
I started it yesterday. Just transferred files from Transforms llvm-obfuscator to llvm 10 sources.

2020-07-14T08:12:44 mushroom -> mentos
Almost everything fits.

2020-07-14T08:13:12 mushroom -> mentos
Didn't you already build clang from source?

2020-07-14T08:13:23 mentos -> mushroom
yes

2020-07-14T08:13:51 mushroom -> mentos
So you know everything.

2020-07-14T08:14:21 mentos -> mushroom
first built the project cmake, then in VS19 rjvgbkbhjdfk 'njn ghjtrn

2020-07-14T08:14:31 mushroom -> mentos
I think for now you need to build a working plugin for opt.

2020-07-14T08:15:03 mushroom -> mentos
And then if it works, integrate it into clang.

2020-07-14T08:15:29 mentos -> mushroom
Give me a link to what you did.

2020-07-14T08:15:52 mentos -> mushroom
is there any in our git or redmine?

2020-07-14T08:15:58 mushroom -> mentos
I didn't upload anything anywhere.

2020-07-15T08:12:45 mentos -> mushroom

2020-07-17T09:14:50 mushroom -> mentos
Hi, do you have the assembled llvm-obfuscator 4?

2020-07-17T09:25:53 mentos -> mushroom
Yes there is - it's like an installer.

2020-07-21T14:02:14 mushroom -> mentos
Hi. Are you here?

2020-07-22T07:52:49 mushroom -> mentos
Hi. You're here.
