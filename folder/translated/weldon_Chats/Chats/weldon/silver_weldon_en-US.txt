[27.07.21 08:39:38] weldon: hi
[27.07.21 08:39:44] silver: hi
[27.07.21 08:40:25] weldon: listen, I'm talking about sub-browser and that source code in our git
[27.07.21 08:41:48] weldon: do you know which python you need? 2.7 in fact and what it was built - MozillaBuildSetup-1.9.0 ?
[27.07.21 08:42:20] silver: no, I don't know anything
[27.07.21 08:42:28] silver: you got to get tunri
[27.07.21 08:42:33] weldon: another mosilla-based build - it'll take 1.5 hours to build, of course
[27.07.21 08:43:03] weldon: now I'm comparing with it what might be faults
[27.07.21 08:43:43] silver: so there are two sources, right?
[27.07.21 08:44:31] weldon: there's one huge folder - about 600 Mb
[27.07.21 08:44:51] weldon: we have
[27.07.21 08:45:29] weldon: I was just training "how to build" on the post FireFox
[27.07.21 08:45:54] silver: and what kind of bugs? you said "now comparing with it what could be bugs"
[27.07.21 08:47:17] weldon: one version of python, then pip, then rustc, then MozillaBuildSetup
[27.07.21 08:47:55] silver: dependencies hell?
[27.07.21 08:47:59] silver: all versions are gone?
[27.07.21 08:49:54] weldon: in ours even with what should be (it's python 2.7 and MozillaBuildSetup 1.9) - mach help doesn't work, so I use mach help in parallel to look for other - what commands exist at all
[27.07.21 08:51:10] weldon: is tunry the author?
[27.07.21 08:51:29] silver: yes, in the old toad our nickname is tunri@
[27.07.21 08:51:33] silver: he doesn't appear for a long time
[27.07.21 08:52:04] silver: what minor version of python is it?
[27.07.21 08:52:12] silver: try this
[27.07.21 08:52:35] silver: look at the dates and versions - what version of the original phyrefox matches the source tree
[27.07.21 08:52:51] silver: then look at the release date of the version in the FF repository
[27.07.21 08:53:11] silver: then just put those versions of python and all the bindings, that were relevant on that date
[27.07.21 08:53:17] silver: I understand the problem
[27.07.21 08:53:36] silver: there is another way to do it
[27.07.21 08:53:49] silver: can you make diffs?
[27.07.21 08:55:17] weldon: no, I can't
[27.07.21 08:55:40] silver: briefly, the idea is to transfer my experience to fresh Mozilla
[27.07.21 08:55:49] silver: or ESR version of mosilla
[27.07.21 08:56:22] silver: 1. we make a diff against the mosilla version on which sb is built
2. patch a newer version of mosilla with this diff and see what comes out
[27.07.21 08:56:33] silver: of course this is a more painful way
[27.07.21 08:56:43] weldon: i.e. take FF and mix it into ours?
[27.07.21 08:56:50] silver: many things could have gone off there, up to not even some files
[27.07.21 08:56:55] silver: well, sort of.
[27.07.21 08:57:03] silver: you understood that SB is a Mozilla fork
[27.07.21 08:57:10] silver: well, you can make a re-fork
[27.07.21 08:57:13] weldon: got it
[27.07.21 08:57:32] silver: but this is an extreme variant, it will be a complicated adaptation
[27.07.21 08:57:39] silver: listen
[27.07.21 08:57:49] silver: you still do point 1 - do the diff
[27.07.21 08:57:49] weldon: SB - of course based on FF
[27.07.21 08:58:00] silver: so you'll understand what tunry was changing
[27.07.21 08:58:04] silver: what was the point of his changes
[27.07.21 08:58:10] silver: and show it to me
[27.07.21 08:58:21] weldon: got it
[27.07.21 08:58:37] silver: download diff and patch from gnuwin32 package
[27.07.21 08:58:56] silver: put nearby directories
mozilla-orig
superbrowser
[27.07.21 08:59:16] silver: command
diff -Naur mozilla-orig superbrowser > superbrowser.patch
[27.07.21 08:59:50] silver: directory must be clean from build artifacts - obj suo ipch .vs and other studio stuff
[27.07.21 09:00:08] weldon: one more thing I noticed - some (old) tools are not supported anymore, like up to 1.1.2020 or 1.1.2021 - maybe it affects it too
[27.07.21 09:00:18] silver: of course it does
[27.07.21 09:00:22] silver: start with the patch
[27.07.21 09:00:33] silver: let's see what kind of changes and how hard it will be to roll them on ESR
[27.07.21 09:00:41] silver: and the Mozilla version you diverged from
[27.07.21 09:01:44] weldon: okay, I'll go on, tunri@ means
[27.07.21 09:02:07] silver: you can't catch it
[27.07.21 09:02:33] weldon: did he quit?
[27.07.21 09:02:42] silver: he was on piecework
[27.07.21 09:02:45] silver: on the job
[27.07.21 09:02:48] weldon: okay.
[27.07.21 09:03:01] silver: before the end of the day roll me the patch and version
[27.07.21 12:23:16] weldon: where better to get sources of FF? I have 99% of links Page not found...
[27.07.21 12:23:30] weldon: https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/2020/02/2020-02-12-09-32-01-mozilla-central-l10n/ it's not clear what to download
[27.07.21 12:23:53] silver: they changed repositories several times
[27.07.21 12:23:55] silver: can't remember at a glance, search
[27.07.21 12:24:04] weldon: ok
[27.07.21 17:20:18] weldon: silver: I created superbrowser.patch, it's 700 MB (734 636 543 bytes) - I'll post it tomorrow morning, okay?
[27.07.21 17:20:29] silver: fuck
[27.07.21 17:20:33] silver: What's in it?
[27.07.21 17:20:56] weldon: ) I dunno - it's just created, is it an archive?
[27.07.21 17:21:30] weldon: here's two bra-ras;

[27.07.21 17:21:50] weldon: okay, bye
[27.07.21 17:22:12] silver: go ahead
[27.07.21 17:22:14] silver: thanks
[28.07.21 09:24:34] weldon: hello
[28.07.21 09:24:45] weldon: send pach?
[28.07.21 09:25:09] silver: hi
[28.07.21 09:25:22] silver: before you send it, look it up in the editor
[28.07.21 09:25:32] silver: to make sure no assembly garbage leaked into it
[28.07.21 09:25:58] weldon: ok, I also thought last night before I went to bed that it's huge)
[28.07.21 10:25:17] silver: what's your FF base version?
[28.07.21 11:21:26] weldon: firefox-74.0b2
[28.07.21 11:23:20] weldon: based on date
[28.07.21 11:23:26] silver: what date is it?
[28.07.21 11:23:46] weldon: 12.02.2020
[28.07.21 11:24:10] silver: how did you get this date?
[28.07.21 11:26:34] weldon: it's the date of changing all the files in the Hub, again, maybe something was changed massively and the date was changed to a later one... i.e. the date could be till 12.02.2020
[28.07.21 11:26:41] silver: wrong
[28.07.21 11:26:52] silver: rewind to the very first commit
[28.07.21 11:27:04] silver: that's why your diff is so big
[28.07.21 11:27:14] silver: it's more like 40-50
[28.07.21 11:27:20] silver: this project is about 5 years old, maybe more
[28.07.21 11:27:31] silver: so you need to look for the place where it was forked from the main tree
[28.07.21 11:28:16] silver: which repo do we have?
[28.07.21 11:28:29] weldon: ok
[28.07.21 11:28:31] weldon: sec

[28.07.21 11:30:39] silver: this is the upload date
[28.07.21 11:30:53] silver: so look for the FF version for this date +- and do with it
[28.07.21 11:31:03] weldon: 5 years...
[28.07.21 11:31:10] weldon: ok, I will
[28.07.21 11:31:12] silver: that's why you can't build
[28.07.21 11:31:19] silver: because you need the toolchain for that date
[28.07.21 11:31:38] silver: take into account that most likely it started even earlier
[28.07.21 11:31:39] weldon: maybe there is a file where you can write the date? i searched, but i couldn't find it
[28.07.21 14:08:35] weldon: if you follow that logic, then the file turns out to be 1.5 GB) BUT I found a suitable FF release - it is from 2019)

[28.07.21 14:12:49] weldon: okay?)
[28.07.21 14:12:55] silver: don't know
[28.07.21 14:13:08] silver: you need to look for similar sources
[28.07.21 14:13:21] silver: don't write and listen
[28.07.21 14:14:37] silver: you need to use git blame
[28.07.21 14:14:42] silver: file history
[28.07.21 14:14:54] silver: you take some source code
[28.07.21 14:15:01] silver: how to choose it is a separate question
[28.07.21 14:15:21] silver: and you look at the log of its changes
[28.07.21 14:15:36] silver: you need to find the point when the superbrowser broke away from it
[28.07.21 14:15:54] silver: maybe get hold of changelog, news or whatever file you have
[28.07.21 14:16:33] silver: where in the official tree the last change is the start of our sb, that's where you found the right date and version
[28.07.21 14:16:44] silver: there are files that don't change for a long time, ten years for example
[28.07.21 14:16:49] silver: there are files that change very quickly
[28.07.21 14:16:57] silver: look at those that change a lot
[28.07.21 14:17:10] silver: to control, check for multiple files
[28.07.21 14:17:14] silver: do you get the idea?
[28.07.21 14:17:31] weldon: not quite yet
[28.07.21 14:17:32] weldon: he compiled on 68.0a1 - this is 100%, I took a little older (which even have sources available) 68.0b3
[28.07.21 14:18:03] silver: how did you know it was 68*
[28.07.21 14:18:04] silver: ?
[28.07.21 14:19:29] weldon: i found file with FF release version) he won't change it right? i found available source, which is a bit older than he is and voila 7 Mb - it's not 700
[28.07.21 14:19:41] silver: well, yes.
[28.07.21 14:19:51] silver: 68 is 2019?
[28.07.21 14:20:20] weldon: 18 Maot 2019 - no sources for it
[28.07.21 14:20:35] silver: why not?
[28.07.21 14:21:08] silver: no for this release date or what?
[28.07.21 14:22:02] weldon: hz, like alpha version, there are sources for *b* versions
[28.07.21 14:22:27] silver: that's not the point
[28.07.21 14:22:53] weldon: and 68.0b3 is the latest 21-May-2019 17:54
[28.07.21 14:22:56] silver: then it turns out that tunri merged periodically
[28.07.21 14:23:01] weldon: yeah
[28.07.21 14:23:10] silver: ok let's say we found a base
[28.07.21 14:23:18] silver: open the patch yourself
[28.07.21 14:23:22] silver: in a text editor
[28.07.21 14:23:47] silver: and find what was changed by tunri and what leaked from trash and version differences (there's probably some there)
[28.07.21 14:24:02] silver: 7M is still quite a lot
[28.07.21 14:24:07] silver: I don't expect 7M code there
[28.07.21 14:24:19] silver: we have 200k source codes for complex projects
[28.07.21 14:24:32] silver: but I believe in 200-500k code of tunri
[28.07.21 14:24:37] weldon: ok, I'll dig, you can open 7Mb with Notpad++
[28.07.21 14:24:37] silver: without pictures and blobs
[28.07.21 14:25:22] weldon: okay, I'll see what I can remove.
[28.07.21 14:25:45] silver: your task is to make a clean patch
[28.07.21 14:26:00] silver: define the base version on which the patch is applied and you get the tree we have
[28.07.21 14:26:13] silver: when you have a clean patch, we'll try to put it on a fresh FF
[28.07.21 14:27:24] silver: then we
1) we'll solve the "your browser is out of date" problem and get all the latest fancy features
2) you'll be able to build with modern toolchain without "there's no such library anymore"
[28.07.21 14:28:09] weldon: ) ok, I'll leave for a while, ok?
[28.07.21 14:29:13] silver: yes
[29.07.21 13:32:18] weldon: hi.
[29.07.21 13:32:44] silver: hi.
[29.07.21 13:33:05] weldon: you said, there are some more repos, should I check them?
[29.07.21 13:34:54] silver: who are you in git?
[29.07.21 13:35:17] weldon: jon, git now 502)
[29.07.21 13:37:32] weldon: 68.0a1 - it's the very first alpha and there are no sources for it ( , and version 68.0b3 - really the closest, all below 67 *** there are diffs > 100Mb, all above: 68.0b4 and 68.0b5 - there diffs start to grow too
[29.07.21 13:37:56] silver: I gave you access to all his repos
[29.07.21 13:37:59] silver: I got the git open
[29.07.21 13:38:08] silver: so you found the version
[29.07.21 13:38:56] weldon: ok, got the git, I'll take a look
[30.07.21 10:26:38] weldon: hi
[30.07.21 10:27:32] silver: hi
[30.07.21 10:27:56] weldon: what do you recommend to clean SBvsFF68.0b3.patch ?

[30.07.21 10:46:31] silver: well, what can I tell you
[30.07.21 10:46:36] silver: you have to get very creative here
[30.07.21 10:46:55] silver: it looks like there are a lot of commits, connected exactly with the fact that we didn't guess the right version
[30.07.21 10:46:58] silver: we should throw them all out
[30.07.21 10:47:09] silver: but we can't see the authors' names there
[30.07.21 10:47:36] silver: that's why you should check the sources of a slightly later version and see, if it has these changes from the patch
[30.07.21 10:47:41] silver: if there are, then the commit is not ours
[30.07.21 10:47:45] silver: remove
[30.07.21 10:47:49] silver: if we don't have it, it's ours.
[30.07.21 11:21:05] weldon: by the way, he (tunri) changed versions by hand

[05.08.21 13:04:29] weldon: got out by accident
[05.08.21 13:13:03] weldon: I found one repo, I think 90% can be much closer to find diff, dig? (I've already downloaded 50Gb from mazilla... kermit says 7Mb - space, some configs required...)
[05.08.21 13:14:20] silver: all this just to avoid reading patch, right?
[05.08.21 13:14:51] weldon: no, not that, to read less
[05.08.21 13:15:10] silver: you have to do it anyway
[05.08.21 13:15:19] weldon: sure
[05.08.21 13:17:26] weldon: you did:
	but you can't see the authors' names there
	that's why you should check the source code of a slightly later version and see if it has these changes from the patch
	if so, it means the patch isn't ours
	remove
	no - it's ours, leave it
i.e. patch in 7Mb compare/diff with later source FF, I got it right?
[05.08.21 13:18:27] silver: are you diffing with what? versions, or individual commits?
[05.08.21 13:18:55] weldon: with versions
[05.08.21 13:19:07] silver: you know there're a lot of intermediate commits between versions?
[05.08.21 13:19:27] weldon: yes
[05.08.21 13:19:38] silver: Does that ring any bells?
[05.08.21 13:19:40] silver: that fact
[05.08.21 13:25:56] weldon: that there's an impersonal commits, that in the diff I got 7Mb, there's like tunri commits + another 100500 people
[05.08.21 13:26:36] silver: you didn't get it hence
[05.08.21 13:27:01] silver: diffs should be done between specific commits
[05.08.21 13:27:13] silver: since you want minimal diff
[05.08.21 13:29:03] weldon: that's what I'm working on right now, I need more details/dates and time.
