[28.07.21 16:47:34] weldon: Yeah.
[28.07.21 16:47:46] weldon: hi
[28.07.21 16:48:21] weldon: with Silver we decided to replay "dopil'" a little - there's a lot of mess
[28.07.21 16:48:56] weldon: in brief, the essence is this:
1. I make a difference/patch between the SB and the FF it's built on
2. i shorten it as much as possible
3. I roll this patch onto the new/last FF
4. Angelo tests it
5. give the product
[28.07.21 16:55:22] weldon: but the timing - dunno, my task now is to make a new build (because the old one is not going anywhere...), and who exactly will finish it - that's what Silver will decide
[28.07.21 16:55:55] weldon: and did not understand that we could find the old - is it already assembled SB?
[28.07.21 16:58:36] weldon: silver Owner 11:34
	you can activate an old version of the browser from adam
	weldon it's your turn
	you need to
	- learn how to build a project
	- work it out
	- compared the assembled binary to what adam has and confirm that it is the same source code
	after that, we'll start to refine it and fix the problems.
	all this is extremely important and no delays are acceptable

[22.11.21 11:20:54] weldon: not a master, maybe because of this?
[22.11.21 11:26:41] adam: do you have any other raps?
[22.11.21 11:26:43] adam: what about them?
[22.11.21 11:26:47] adam: everything is fine on the server side
