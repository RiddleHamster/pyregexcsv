[28.07.21 09:58:48] angelo: hi
[28.07.21 09:58:52] angelo: I wanted to ask you
[28.07.21 09:59:05] angelo: any problems with the trike? or just bad scripts?
[28.07.21 10:02:06] silver: you tell me
[28.07.21 10:02:08] silver: Hi.
[28.07.21 10:02:28] silver: give me a dynamometer report on the dincheck
[28.07.21 10:02:34] silver: full internet 240 seconds
[28.07.21 10:02:52] silver: one report is the source
the second report - the most popular crypto stub
[28.07.21 10:08:52] angelo: I don't crypt
[28.07.21 10:09:05] angelo: my question was caused by the client
[28.07.21 10:09:07] angelo: Zeus
[28.07.21 10:09:15] angelo: that their bots die fast
[28.07.21 10:09:35] angelo: guys are frustrated, so I decided to ask if this problem is solved and what is it
[28.07.21 10:09:52] silver: low quality of testing
[28.07.21 10:11:53] angelo: I haven't written a report yet, today is Wednesday
[28.07.21 10:12:29] angelo: me and Jaime discovered when we were doing nonsense with configs for the injector that vinda was blocking itself
[28.07.21 10:12:36] angelo: don't know if you're into that or not
[28.07.21 10:12:44] silver: don't know, tell me
[28.07.21 10:14:00] angelo: after starting the bot on the machine, after a short period of time (maybe a couple of minutes), even with the lock disabled after the axis was idle, the windup was blocked. For modules, I can not say, Jaime said that after starting the injector, but we used not test bot, and there were a lot of modules running, that is, I can not say that there was a dependency
[28.07.21 10:14:28] silver: > the windup was blocked
what do you mean by that?
[28.07.21 10:15:01] angelo: you know, you get a lock screen with pictures) where you have to enter the password to enter the windup
[28.07.21 10:15:08] angelo: i don't know what to call it correctly
[28.07.21 10:15:40] silver: ah
[28.07.21 10:15:45] silver: well, it's nothing
[28.07.21 10:15:49] silver: if you unlocked it, it works
[28.07.21 10:16:02] angelo: that's question number 2
[28.07.21 10:16:21] angelo: and I wouldn't say it works the way it did before the lock
[28.07.21 10:17:08] angelo: now let tester test this point
[28.07.21 10:17:12] angelo: who is the tric
[28.07.21 10:17:28] angelo: I've got Fratzn telling me to test Superbrauser.....
[29.07.21 08:57:52] angelo: hi
[29.07.21 08:57:58] angelo: Can I borrow you for a minute?
[29.07.21 08:58:10] angelo: I need some clarification on superbrowser
[29.07.21 09:03:33] silver: hi
[29.07.21 09:03:34] silver: ask
[29.07.21 09:03:48] angelo: I'm as dumb as always
[29.07.21 09:03:56] angelo: here we are loading the browser config
[29.07.21 09:03:59] angelo: in SB
[29.07.21 09:04:04] angelo: and then what should be ?
[29.07.21 09:04:21] angelo: the story appeared
[29.07.21 09:04:37] silver: you know what
[29.07.21 09:04:40] silver: go to hammer
[29.07.21 09:04:46] silver: he was testing it
[29.07.21 09:05:02] angelo: got it, I'll wait for him
[29.07.21 09:05:07] angelo: and Weldon is SB's developer ?
[29.07.21 09:05:11] silver: no
[29.07.21 09:05:17] silver: he will support it
[29.07.21 09:05:19] silver: another one developed it
[29.07.21 09:05:27] angelo: got it
[29.07.21 09:15:48] angelo: there is one more question
[29.07.21 12:52:38] angelo: which module robs configs for SB ?
[29.07.21 12:52:47] angelo: corrupt ?
[29.07.21 12:52:55] silver: yes
[29.07.21 12:52:57] silver: importDll
[29.07.21 12:53:09] angelo: so, it's to Brooks?
[29.07.21 12:54:29] silver: lf
[29.07.21 12:54:30] silver: yes
[29.07.21 12:57:37] angelo: is it a problem with cookies ?
[29.07.21 12:57:46] angelo: 2 weeks ago client had no such problems
[29.07.21 12:57:54] angelo: what happened ?
[29.07.21 12:58:16] silver: busy
[03.08.21 10:41:11] angelo: Hi.
[03.08.21 10:41:14] angelo: I'll just be a sec.
[03.08.21 10:41:18] silver: Hi.
[03.08.21 10:41:41] angelo: I understand you correctly (I could be wrong easily) - SuperBrowser will not work until Import
[03.08.21 10:41:49] angelo: we have other grabbers
[03.08.21 10:41:56] angelo: I have a puzzle in my head
[03.08.21 10:42:04] silver: other robbers are for another
[03.08.21 10:42:08] silver: yes, you got it right
[03.08.21 10:42:20] silver: until import works like clockwork, there will be no deal with SB
[03.08.21 10:42:24] silver: but SB itself is crooked too
[03.08.21 10:42:36] silver: both components must be debugged separately
[03.08.21 10:42:37] angelo: not ugly, but client was very happy about it
[03.08.21 10:43:12] angelo: 3 weeks ago he could work with it at least somehow, so we are waiting for the import
[03.08.21 10:43:14] angelo: thanks
[05.08.21 12:01:51] angelo: hi, you wrote about Edge changing a lot. Zeus was asking if it's possible to make a ject on the Edge.
[05.08.21 12:01:56] angelo: is it real ?!
[05.08.21 12:02:02] angelo: heime is busy
[05.08.21 12:20:44] silver: Hi.
[05.08.21 12:20:48] silver: unrealistic
[05.08.21 12:21:41] angelo: got it, I'll wait for more haime and then we'll give an answer to the client
[05.08.21 12:23:39] silver: I'm sure it won't work
[05.08.21 12:23:47] silver: I don't think anyone has such support right now
[05.08.21 12:24:03] silver: they screwed in some kind of wunderwaffle for memory protection in 18 or 19
[05.08.21 12:24:09] silver: it's unlikely they gave it up in the chrome engine
[05.08.21 12:24:15] silver: I couldn't overcome it
[05.08.21 12:24:43] angelo: I have a very high opinion of Jaime )
[05.08.21 12:24:56] angelo: just a client said that on Edge a lot of clients pass by
[05.08.21 12:25:21] silver: let the client name those who support edge
[05.08.21 12:25:27] silver: we'll find the sample and reverse it
[05.08.21 12:25:47] angelo: hmm, I'll suggest it )
[05.08.21 12:26:07] silver: or have him drop a demo
[05.08.21 12:26:11] silver: it's for real, we did it that way
[05.08.21 12:26:27] silver: and be sure to specify supported version
[05.08.21 12:26:31] angelo: I understand and accept
[05.08.21 12:26:33] angelo: ok
[05.08.21 12:26:40] angelo: got what you said
[25.08.21 11:43:54] angelo: hi.
[25.08.21 11:44:01] angelo: there's a catch.
[25.08.21 11:44:15] angelo: inject works under vnts2 on vm
[25.08.21 11:44:22] angelo: but not in battle bots
[25.08.21 11:44:47] silver: hi
[25.08.21 11:45:23] silver: so, what?)
[25.08.21 11:45:27] angelo: where to dig ?
[25.08.21 11:45:32] angelo: why can it be ?!
[25.08.21 11:45:36] angelo: what is the difference ?!
[25.08.21 11:45:42] silver: in module version for example
[25.08.21 11:45:52] angelo: for example we restarted it
[25.08.21 11:46:12] angelo: although, you know, now let's double-check exactly with group of Zeus
[25.08.21 11:46:14] angelo: and report back
[21.09.21 08:38:37] angelo: hi!
[21.09.21 08:38:41] angelo: will brooks come out ?
[21.09.21 08:39:11] silver: hi
[21.09.21 08:39:17] silver: yeah, why, did he say something like that?
[21.09.21 08:40:05] angelo: No, I didn't see him yesterday
[21.09.21 08:40:11] angelo: and he's usually gone in the morning
[21.09.21 08:40:17] angelo: about the anchor
[21.09.21 08:40:21] silver: he often does
[21.09.21 08:40:24] silver: you can't see it
[21.09.21 08:40:35] angelo: got it, he's a sly ass
[29.09.21 14:45:58] angelo: hello
[29.09.21 14:46:05] angelo: do you know new anchor from brooks ?
[29.09.21 14:46:32] angelo: bot knocked out, I check the commands, but they do not work ... whether he initiated you
[22.10.21 10:56:07] angelo: otr
[26.10.21 10:06:09] angelo: hi
[26.10.21 10:06:19] silver: hi
[26.10.21 10:06:24] angelo: apr
[26.10.21 10:06:51] angelo: Mont asks about dead bots
[26.10.21 10:06:54] angelo: which are not few
[26.10.21 10:07:06] angelo: Cactus assures him that AB
[26.10.21 10:07:16] angelo: can I be sure of anything ?
[26.10.21 10:07:32] angelo: 22884d16bb7eb90ba2b25b2a93391456

6b041db024df14e7921cfeff0748b69e
[26.10.21 10:07:33] silver: I don't understand the question
[26.10.21 10:07:51] angelo: [01:27:49] <mont> I also have a question about bot survivability
[01:27:56] <mont> I'm tired to write the same
[01:28:04] <mont> I feel like a parrot
[26.10.21 10:08:03] angelo: [01:28:22] <mont> these are the bots in uk that haven't lived an hour
[01:28:27] <mont> and there are plenty of them
[01:28:47] <azot> and what does cactus call it ?
[01:28:58] <mont> ah fuck
[26.10.21 10:08:20] silver: where's the question?
[26.10.21 10:08:36] silver: what do you want from dead bots ?
[26.10.21 10:08:39] angelo: how can you understand the cause of death ?
[26.10.21 10:08:54] silver: go to that machine and see
[26.10.21 10:09:14] silver: read logs
[26.10.21 10:09:24] silver: yeah, you can't go to that machine
[26.10.21 10:09:46] angelo: says there are a lot of such bots
[26.10.21 10:10:14] silver: the ones that die right away
[26.10.21 10:11:01] silver: well, let's think logically, what else could it be?
[26.10.21 10:11:24] silver: if the bot lived for, say, half a day or a day, and then fell away, it was not started by fixing
[26.10.21 10:11:49] silver: if it lived for half an hour, it is AB, because first half an hour is the most dangerous time for bot, while it is going through proactivation
[26.10.21 10:12:42] silver: and you ask sapp, and how would he himself know the reason on the machine he can't enter?
[26.10.21 10:14:02] angelo: all dead bots have a limit of up to an hour...well, logically there can be no other options, i understand
[26.10.21 10:14:38] silver: is that the only question? because somewhere in the air is implied dissatisfaction with their number
[26.10.21 10:14:49] angelo: the client always expects a miracle, I understand that everything must work well, and if not - it means a fault of the performer
[26.10.21 10:15:01] angelo: yes, the quantity also as I understand it takes place
[26.10.21 10:15:13] angelo: I honestly did not ask what % of bot deaths
[26.10.21 10:17:25] angelo: <mont> 80% die
[26.10.21 10:17:46] silver: what should you use?
[26.10.21 10:18:34] angelo: on bad cryptos
[26.10.21 10:18:37] angelo: we have to think
[26.10.21 10:19:04] silver: no, i mean, what percentage should it be? and who exactly has it? and some proofs would be nice
[26.10.21 10:19:23] angelo: zeus band
[26.10.21 10:19:33] silver: mont is zeus' sapp
[26.10.21 10:19:33] angelo: hmm
[26.10.21 10:20:18] angelo: is mont our guy or their guy ?
[26.10.21 10:21:18] silver: their man, sapp zeus
[26.10.21 10:21:23] silver: sapp = sappor, helper
[26.10.21 10:21:28] angelo: sapp understood )
[26.10.21 10:21:56] angelo: can we look at the stats ourselves ?
[26.10.21 10:22:13] angelo: haven't contacted her before
[26.10.21 10:22:21] silver: you don't understand
[26.10.21 10:22:39] silver: well, they tell you, 80% of dead is fucked up
[26.10.21 10:22:41] silver: let's say
[26.10.21 10:22:44] silver: what do you want?
[26.10.21 10:23:33] silver: he'll say not more than half
[26.10.21 10:24:42] silver: the second question - why so much?
answer options
- they worked with so-and-so software and in 2015 it was like this
- worked with so-and-so software and in 2021 it was like this
(answer choices based on past experience)
- it is unprofitable with the percentage higher than so-and-so (a purely commercial motive)
[26.10.21 10:27:10] angelo: I understand what they are getting at
[26.10.21 10:27:16] angelo: i honestly do not know how contracts are made
[26.10.21 10:27:27] angelo: as I understand it, when you make a deal, they give you some figures
[26.10.21 10:27:53] silver: we do not have such a direct agreement about the percentage, everything is based on the feelings
[26.10.21 10:28:04] angelo: And you were right in his answer
[26.10.21 10:28:08] silver: okay, there's another way
[26.10.21 10:28:48] silver: you're testing - run it for 10 minutes, static check went clean, dynamic check went clean, bot knocked out, command accepted-executed - ok
[26.10.21 10:28:50] angelo: [03:27:06] <mont> on that bot we ran last year, online was like this
[03:27:27] <mont> the first day 1000 bots alive 700
[03:28:04] <mont> then 200-300 left for the week
[03:28:41] <mont> and in general bot was alive till we got caught
[26.10.21 10:29:19] silver: if you want to know what's going on with bots, run them on vm farm for a day or two
[26.10.21 10:29:21] silver: on different av
[26.10.21 10:29:43] angelo: [03:28:50] <mont> av did not detect it in any way
[03:29:17] <mont> I've seen with my eyes a million times when they scanned the car completely and no use
[26.10.21 10:29:49] angelo: is it fantastic ?
[26.10.21 10:30:01] angelo: so they used to use immortal bots ?
[26.10.21 10:30:05] silver: it's just a top coder
[26.10.21 10:30:19] silver: I know what bot he's talking about and it's not fantastic
[26.10.21 10:30:59] silver: when was the last time we tested bots for survivability?
[26.10.21 10:31:10] angelo: but how do we argue for mortality without dropping ourselves in the mud?
[26.10.21 10:31:18] angelo: i have no idea
[26.10.21 10:32:39] angelo: the narrow survivability of our bots is going to change the code? if it's really 80% mortality, Colin could do anything, but he always gives the answer - AB and that's the end of it
[26.10.21 10:34:14] silver: man, you still do not understand that you personally have the ball ? )
[26.10.21 10:34:18] silver: when was the last time we tested bots for survivability?
[26.10.21 10:34:38] silver: > how do you test - ran for 10 minutes, static check passed - clear, dynamics check passed - clear, the bot knocked out, the command accepted-executed - ok
[26.10.21 10:34:57] silver: still the same?
and it's still a good option when the knockback test passes, because usually it is limited to statics
[26.10.21 10:35:38] angelo: it is possible to run on the farm once a week, because every day it seems impossible
[26.10.21 10:35:55] angelo: i have to do brooks walkthrough on the farm today
[26.10.21 10:36:08] angelo: and I can pass the survivability test
[26.10.21 10:36:34] silver: honestly, i don't understand how that coder got that result
[26.10.21 10:37:01] silver: even just to pass all combinations of OS and AB tests is a lot of time
[26.10.21 10:37:12] silver: and you have to give out builds every day
[26.10.21 10:37:23] silver: be an industrial spy, find out how it was achieved
[26.10.21 10:38:02] silver: find out any details, little things
[26.10.21 10:38:14] silver: how often were the uploads (daily, not daily)
[26.10.21 10:38:26] silver: how was testing, on what AB, OS
[26.10.21 10:42:58] silver: ``

```
[26.10.21 10:43:04] silver: have you looked into these bots yourself?
[26.10.21 10:43:14] angelo: looked at the three
[26.10.21 10:43:22] silver: I looked at all of them.
[26.10.21 10:43:24] silver: what did you see there?
[26.10.21 10:44:54] angelo: launch one dll
[26.10.21 10:44:55] angelo: and death
[26.10.21 10:45:03] silver: Mm-hmm.
[26.10.21 10:45:12] silver: so maybe the dllk burned them out?
[26.10.21 10:45:25] angelo: already asked what was loaded
[26.10.21 10:45:58] silver: the death can be not instantly by the load start, but in 10-15 min - the load is just caught on the proactive
[26.10.21 10:46:26] silver: and bot-parent will be computed by the process tree (because it is a parent process of the load) and taken out
[26.10.21 10:48:00] silver: so, look
[26.10.21 10:48:11] silver: they're running loads by dlls
[26.10.21 10:48:24] angelo: the stller was loading for a couple of days, before that the loads were dying before autoloading
[26.10.21 10:48:24] silver: dll start is weak point
[26.10.21 10:49:02] silver: yup, let's go complex, I'll spell out the following points
- load cleanliness
- ways to run loads
[26.10.21 10:49:48] silver: here they run a styler, it's a third party styler as far as I know, it's called racoon
[26.10.21 10:50:11] silver: who ensures the purity of the load? who crypts it, who tests it?
[26.10.21 10:51:19] angelo: now he requested bots where there was no load, but bots are dead
[26.10.21 10:52:06] angelo: interesting confrontation turns out, everyone defends his rightness and there must be a truth/first cause between them
[26.10.21 10:52:48] silver: this is not a confrontation, this is a helpdesk job
[26.10.21 10:52:59] silver: we have it so badly set up
[26.10.21 10:55:35] angelo: now I'll watch bots without load
[26.10.21 10:55:47] silver: we haven't talked it through
[26.10.21 10:56:17] angelo: listening very carefully and not even trying to escape from you
[26.10.21 10:56:20] silver: you see, for everything to work perfectly, all heterogeneous programs must be tested as a system, not as a set of dice
[26.10.21 10:56:34] silver: people run some loads, it echoes me
[26.10.21 10:56:48] silver: they run cobalt, sliver, something else
[26.10.21 10:57:48] silver: for AV, there is no difference, AV takes the following chain as a system:
- letter in the mailbox
- document with macro or other type of delivery
- the dropper in the document that launches the bot
- bot
- loads triggered by bot
[26.10.21 10:58:07] silver: of the whole chain we have full control only over the bot, and also over the crypts that cover the bot
[26.10.21 10:58:27] silver: also our crypts cover the workloads and we have some control there too - we have at least an approximate idea of the purity of the workloads
[26.10.21 10:58:52] silver: over everything else we have no control and mostly we don't even understand normality
[26.10.21 10:59:11] silver: non-normality we get only in the form of negative from the client, and when everything is fine we know nothing about how the system works
[26.10.21 10:59:53] silver: I repeat, in order to make it work as a clockwork mechanism - you need to control everything, and test everything, all possible combinations
[26.10.21 10:59:59] silver: of course, it is impossible
[26.10.21 11:00:10] silver: even physically, with all the desire
[26.10.21 11:00:40] silver: it's for understanding the big picture
[26.10.21 11:00:48] silver: now point 2 on methods of starting loads
[26.10.21 11:01:18] silver: there will be point 3 on the operator manual, which nobody reads
[26.10.21 11:02:58] silver: in terms of resistance from AB, the methods of launching the loads are as follows (and they have a reflection in the builder of the commands of admin bk)
1) reflexive dll startup (made only in bk royal, there is no startup option in main admin)
2) reflective launch of exe (process hollowing, available in admin and in all bots)
3) launching dll via regsvr with a drop to disk (not available in bots and add-in)
4) launch dll via rundll with drop to disk (found in all bots and addin)
[26.10.21 11:03:24] silver: 5) launching exe with drop to disk (everybody has it, it is a "last wish" option)
[26.10.21 11:03:38] silver: all use point 4 now
[26.10.21 11:03:43] silver: point 1 is ignored
[26.10.21 11:03:55] silver: point 2 is ignored
[26.10.21 11:04:05] silver: point 1 needs to be tested and implemented
[26.10.21 11:04:52] angelo: well, again, that's if we talk about pure load, here's to understand % of death with and without load for pure statistics figures
[26.10.21 11:05:49] silver: somebody must do it, so keep such records
[26.10.21 11:05:52] angelo: so they use only one launch method, it's no good
[26.10.21 11:06:09] silver: these stereotypes are because it was good once
[26.10.21 11:06:22] silver: also maybe because dlls always show better results on tests than exe
[26.10.21 11:06:33] silver: on tests *without* considering the launching method
[26.10.21 11:06:48] silver: your priority now
[26.10.21 11:08:10] silver: you try to run with exe injection (p1) on your clients, find out the background why they don't want to
this will require load redesigning, because for more than a year already all give out dll - exe may not assemble at once at our coders
implement reflexive dll startup - go to collin, demand it from him
[26.10.21 11:08:19] silver: test it
[26.10.21 11:08:40] silver: already this alone will improve survivability. Not by much, but rubles are taken from pennies.
[26.10.21 11:11:23] silver: p3 operator manual
[26.10.21 11:11:25] silver: do you have it?
[26.10.21 11:11:48] angelo: Colin threw it to me
[26.10.21 11:12:04] silver: it covers it
[26.10.21 11:12:17] silver: about launching methods
[26.10.21 11:13:06] angelo: looking for
[26.10.21 11:13:48] silver: well, why did we write it if they don't even know about it?
[26.10.21 11:14:08] silver: bot is a precision tool, you can't swing it like a hammer
[26.10.21 11:14:43] angelo: i understand, bots launched 10K and started throwing everything at anyone
[26.10.21 11:14:58] silver: yes
[26.10.21 11:15:08] silver: burned a bunch of bots, then yelled oh everything
[26.10.21 11:15:24] silver: any bot's activity is a death knell
[10/26/221 11:15:45] angelo: I'll go through the bots from the 23/24th. Monk assures that there were no load and die like rabbits
[26.10.21 11:15:50] silver: so any command should be given with the understanding that it is done in the best way, load checked for compatibility
[26.10.21 11:16:06] silver: > die like rabbits
yeah i'm not arguing, that's the way it is
[26.10.21 11:16:12] silver: i'm dealing with other things
[26.10.21 11:16:30] silver: > rubles are taken from pennies
[26.10.21 11:18:11] angelo: if only there were Ramon guys
[26.10.21 11:18:18] angelo: there's a rabble to be honest
[26.10.21 11:18:24] angelo: sloppy and chaotic
[26.10.21 11:18:43] angelo: but zeus' staff as a whole is savvy
[26.10.21 11:32:16] angelo: well, for 23-24 numbers on the 39 group I see about 120 bots, 100 of them dead. Of the 100, 20% were with any load.
[26.10.21 11:32:38] angelo: 80 bots out of 120 died within 30 minutes without load
[26.10.21 11:33:07] angelo: he can do the math himself and give that result with the argument that guys didn't even load them
[26.10.21 11:33:58] angelo: again, what counter argument can we have here ?
[26.10.21 11:37:11] silver: none, we have a fuck up here
[26.10.21 11:37:20] silver: what to do about it i said
[26.10.21 11:37:32] silver: where the bots are extinct, collect data on AV
[26.10.21 11:37:43] silver: also see if the machine was hanic or exploratory
[26.10.21 11:39:31] angelo: accepted
[26.10.21 11:40:16] silver: you can pull the alphonse on the stats you want
[26.10.21 11:40:25] silver: he'll query the database
[26.10.21 11:40:38] silver: like "what were the avs in bots that lived less than an hour, on such and such date"
[26.10.21 11:40:54] silver: and number of bots with each type of av
[26.10.21 11:41:04] silver: "what was the os in the bots"...
[26.10.21 11:41:29] silver: i.e. find out information for tests - on whom to test, in order to reproduce not survivability
[26.10.21 11:50:13] angelo: so, make a list of AVs and OSes where bots die fast by themselves and let them test in longtime mode
[26.10.21 11:50:29] silver: yeah
[26.10.21 11:50:53] silver: only there are win10 and vindef everywhere anyway because it's the most common combo
[26.10.21 11:51:03] silver: so you don't have to waste your time and check it right away )
[26.10.21 11:51:48] angelo: and tell me, is there any difference in this test, in this case, VM mine or our farm ?
[26.10.21 11:52:06] angelo: exactly speaking now about Def +10 vinda
[26.10.21 11:52:11] silver: no, the main difference will bring you geo
[26.10.21 11:52:24] silver: it depends what kind of vpn/geo you use to cover virtual machines
[26.10.21 11:52:33] angelo: got it, I'll make a clean OS and run
[26.10.21 14:03:21] angelo: I'll be gone for a while for the little guy
[27.10.21 09:49:50] angelo: hi
[27.10.21 09:53:47] silver: hi.
[08.11.21 15:09:08] silver: yeah.
[08.11.21 15:09:15] angelo: i found the webroute detects on friday
[08.11.21 15:09:19] angelo: i don't know if you saw it or not
[08.11.21 15:09:28] silver: no
[08.11.21 15:09:28] silver: detects for what?
[08.11.21 15:09:33] angelo: matched hash to module, it's definitely detected
[08.11.21 15:09:35] angelo: VNC
[08.11.21 15:09:47] silver: ok
[08.11.21 15:09:58] silver: good that you found it, I mean, learned to localize it
[08.11.21 15:10:02] silver: very good
[08.11.21 15:10:49] angelo: well, not everything
[08.11.21 15:10:51] angelo: what to do next?
[08.11.21 15:11:08] angelo: webroot doesn't give any static detects
[08.11.21 15:11:18] angelo: where to write/who to
[08.11.21 15:12:09] silver: write grem as a module developer
[08.11.21 15:12:18] silver: dear grem, clean the module from webroot
[08.11.21 15:12:22] silver: here is the proof
[08.11.21 15:14:08] angelo: got it
[08.11.21 15:14:17] angelo: another question
[08.11.21 15:14:25] angelo: sometimes i don't understand adam
[08.11.21 15:14:29] angelo: his tasks
[08.11.21 15:14:53] angelo: if you watched the group Tricky Pr. There was a discussion about running shel on bots in uk
[08.11.21 15:15:28] angelo: Def is silent so far, I did not understand what is the shellcode and what is it for if Robin launches the trike from uk with a simple dll.
[10.11.21 14:23:49] silver: otr)
[10.11.21 14:24:39] silver: what admins do you have access to?
[10.11.21 14:24:54] angelo: new and old
[10.11.21 14:25:05] angelo: x6rci
[10.11.21 14:25:11] angelo: lch5n
[10.11.21 14:25:31] silver: if you see a bot marked "free" or "azot" or "problems couldn't raise the session" or any other notes, this is for you
[10.11.21 14:25:44] silver: also you may be written to the toad by the people who put these marks
[10.11.21 14:26:40] silver: you need to catch such bots regularly and
- if you have time, watch the logs of AV at the time of commands
- tell me the ID of these bots
[10.11.21 14:27:25] angelo: that's what I try to do
[10.11.21 14:27:41] angelo: monitoring admins is very productive =/
[10.11.21 14:27:45] silver: the point is it's important to catch these bots in time
[10.11.21 14:27:51] silver: bots are very valuable
[10.11.21 14:28:10] silver: where the hackers tried to enter and failed - and the bot is still alive - for example, this bot can be sold
[10.11.21 14:28:25] silver: but if it's dead, you can't sell it
[10.11.21 14:29:49] angelo: ah, so it's outside of Robin or Derek
[10.11.21 14:30:09] silver: you have access to all groups ?
[10.11.21 14:30:31] silver: you need access to all the groups
[10.11.21 14:30:32] angelo: by the way, i was crypting the damn VNC till 3:30 last night and was testing brooks' program ((
[10.11.21 14:30:36] angelo: no of course
[10.11.21 14:30:44] angelo: let me see what kind

[10.11.21 14:35:22] silver: let them add you to all groups
[10.11.21 14:38:04] angelo: unsubscribe
[10.11.21 14:40:13] angelo: you know, I usually do not start such conversations, but it seems to me that I have grown attached to the laptop and it is unreasonable, even mine is beginning to think that I am a fool
[10.11.21 14:40:43] silver: take it and train an assistant
[10.11.21 14:40:59] silver: and I'll give you a bonus
[10.11.21 14:44:05] angelo: i have no place to take an assistant, i'd probably do it myself, but i'm really bored with 1300 to be honest, and 300 was added after i asked for it
[10.11.21 14:44:13] angelo: i'm basically on call 14-16 hours a day
[10.11.21 14:44:27] angelo: always coming to help like that damn chip and dale
[10.11.21 14:45:01] silver: i passed your words on to frans]
[10.11.21 14:45:37] angelo: I was gonna tell Stern, we had a discussion about it
[10.11.21 14:45:46] silver: Write!
[10.11.21 14:45:49] silver: I'll support it
[10.11.21 14:46:05] angelo: I don't want to give a fuck about my job.
[10.11.21 14:46:36] silver: and about assistants, why not?
[10.11.21 14:46:36] silver: let's look for them]
[10.11.21 14:49:35] silver: don't worry
[10.11.21 14:49:45] silver: beat it out of Manuel
[10.11.21 14:50:01] silver: if we can't get and train someone, we'll hire from the outside
[10.11.21 14:50:38] silver: if you have such a load, then let's share it and make you the head of your tech support team
[10.11.21 14:50:48] silver: and if you're gonna be a support teammate, then there's more money for that
[10.11.21 14:50:51] silver: something like this
[10.11.21 14:51:35] silver: I wrote him
[10.11.21 14:52:00] angelo: I don't have a tech base like that (
[10.11.21 14:53:05] silver: you have persistence
[10.11.21 14:53:14] silver: that's a basic quality
[10.11.21 14:53:53] silver: okay, you got it.
[10.11.21 14:53:56] silver: about hiring
[10.11.21 14:54:50] angelo: didn't think it was crucial
[10.11.21 14:54:52] angelo: okay
[10.11.21 14:55:01] angelo: see where it takes us
[10.11.21 14:55:12] silver: it's crucial, trust me.
[11.11.21 07:58:44] angelo: hi
[11.11.21 07:58:50] angelo: talked to robin yesterday
[11.11.21 07:59:17] angelo: they were using IcedID
[11.11.21 07:59:45] silver: I know
[11.11.21 07:59:52] silver: and he told me how fucking great it was
[11.11.21 08:00:02] angelo: not like that
[11.11.21 08:00:05] angelo: it was
[11.11.21 08:00:12] angelo: it wasn't great afterwards
[11.11.21 08:00:18] angelo: what would help us?
[11.11.21 08:00:21] angelo: there are screenshots
[11.11.21 08:00:29] angelo: just them for now
[11.11.21 08:00:36] silver: help with what?
[11.11.21 08:00:55] angelo: well, you said to find out anything from the last bot
[11.11.21 08:01:03] angelo: I was wondering if you needed any codecs
[11.11.21 08:01:19] silver: nobody except bot author has sources
[11.11.21 08:01:41] silver: screenshots will not help. Is it interesting to assess the actual statistics on the bounces and survivability
[11.11.21 08:04:03] angelo: no matter how fucked up, you know the outcome
[11.11.21 08:04:18] silver: never mind
[11.11.21 08:04:22] silver: we have nothing to reproach ourselves with
[11.11.21 08:04:36] angelo: but there is a little residue
[11.11.21 08:04:44] angelo: agree
[11.11.21 08:04:54] silver: Nope.)
[11.11.21 08:05:03] silver: I disagree]
[11.11.21 08:05:05] silver: I have no residue
[11.11.21 08:05:21] silver: you know, it's like oil
[11.11.21 08:05:28] silver: Go to the market and look for a cheaper, thicker one.
[11.11.21 08:06:31] angelo: I just don't know the market and I don't know my competitors, and my conclusion is local, for us, more information - more understanding of market conditions
[11.11.21 08:15:07] angelo: Can Hymie give the VNC code ? There are problems with it, we can not understand.
[11.11.21 08:15:44] silver: Yes
[11.11.21 08:15:47] silver: and grem does not pull?
[11.11.21 08:16:06] angelo: honestly, he doesn't want to get into the code
[11.11.21 08:16:40] angelo: Hymie otherwise
[11.11.21 08:16:55] silver: i give permission, but i dont have access to code myself) so grem should share in git
[11.11.21 08:16:56] angelo: he's always willing to dive in to figure it out
[11.11.21 08:17:06] angelo: ok, thanks
[11.11.21 09:50:12] angelo: i have two questions
[11.11.21 09:50:25] angelo: when will the bot trades start
[11.11.21 09:50:30] angelo: and second, who will you sell to? )
[11.11.21 09:51:10] silver: i don't know
I still need to assess the scale of trouble
[11.11.21 09:51:15] silver: how many bots are going down
[11.11.21 09:59:27] angelo: sorry there's trouble at all
[11/17/11/21 10:22:23] angelo: hi
[17.11.21 10:22:47] angelo: i know you're very busy there and i even think i know what
[17.11.21 10:22:47] silver: koo
[17.11.21 10:22:56] angelo: two questions
[17.11.21 10:23:00] silver: go ahead
[17.11.21 10:23:04] angelo: should the herald be paid?
[17.11.21 10:23:06] angelo: second
[17.11.21 10:23:10] angelo: me what ?
[17.11.21 10:23:13] angelo: same 650 ?
[17.11.21 10:23:19] angelo: sadness sadness and pain
[17.11.21 10:23:29] silver: don't know anything about herald
[17.11.21 10:23:40] angelo: ok, I took it off
[17.11.21 10:23:43] silver: I asked you for a bonus both now and at the end of the month, they haven't given you one yet?
[17.11.21 10:23:50] silver: and a raise from December
[17.11.21 10:24:15] angelo: no, they haven't, but i honestly need it
[17.11.21 10:24:41] silver: told the French
[17.11.21 10:24:47] angelo: ok, thanks
[17.11.21 10:24:59] angelo: should have been a dentist, they rip you off.
[17.11.21 10:29:34] silver: everything will be fine
[17.11.21 10:29:41] silver: the franchise approves
[17.11.21 10:29:57] silver: don't talk about dentists
[17.11.21 10:30:05] angelo: great, yesterday I gave 30K through the pain
[17.11.21 10:39:08] silver: france said he got you up to 1800
[17.11.21 10:39:26] silver: are you satisfied? )
[17.11.21 10:42:03] angelo: i appreciate it!
[17.11.21 10:42:13] silver: and me to you
[17.11.21 10:42:23] angelo: now my visits to these thieves in robes will be less painless
[17.11.21 10:42:40] silver: crooks
[17.11.21 10:42:47] silver: I hate them because they lie
[17.11.21 10:42:58] angelo: really, thanks, it'll be easier to breathe
[17.11.21 10:43:08] silver: come on!)
[17.11.21 10:43:08] angelo: I hate that they take advantage of our weakness
[17.11.21 10:45:07] angelo: I don't pry, but by any chance your question about Perl/Scala/Go/Lua in general chat is not related to Zeus ?
[17.11.21 10:45:40] silver: no
