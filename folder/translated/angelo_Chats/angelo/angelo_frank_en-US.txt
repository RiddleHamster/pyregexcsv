[13.08.21 17:20:36] angelo: what is this
[13.08.21 17:21:09] frank: It's a super list, where you can see all the bots that uploaded
[13.08.21 17:21:24] frank: It's really weird that he gave it to you, but he didn't give you vault access
[13.08.21 17:21:39] frank: But the bot's id is tricky
[13.08.21 17:22:07] frank: And you just can't match it
[13.08.21 17:22:18] frank: Just ask for VNC Access rights
[13.08.21 17:23:07] angelo: Okay.
[13.08.21 17:23:16] angelo: I'm waiting for adam. In the meantime, I'll ask again.

[13.08.21 17:26:28] frank: Test everything works?
[13.08.21 17:26:37] angelo: our task is to test Inject module under VNC
[13.08.21 17:26:48] angelo: And also to test GNC

[13.08.21 17:31:35] angelo: any rights ?
[13.08.21 17:32:11] angelo: is it possible that VNC does not work for all groups ?
[13.08.21 17:32:57] frank: I'll fix it, it should not be in prod yet
[13.08.21 17:33:17] angelo: now I do not understand what we're talking about.

[16.08.21 17:11:56] frank: Ip does not change, like
[16.08.21 17:12:22] frank: If it changes, then not every day.
The ip does not match at least may be about the gasket
[16.08.21 17:12:38] frank: The question is what kind of data he needs
[16.08.21 17:12:55] frank: And why
[18.08.21 12:48:34] angelo: hi.
[18.08.21 12:50:28] angelo: we need to look at the bot's logs

[18.08.21 13:03:44] angelo: Mm-hmm.
[18.08.21 13:03:53] angelo: there's a config for the inject module
[18.08.21 13:41:40] angelo: this bot is better 3B2C3BFC65EA3BE0839A9B305570CBB2
[18.08.21 13:49:28] frank: So I accessed the bot, but where exactly is this inject config?
[18.08.21 13:49:51] frank: is it for me?

[20.08.21 10:02:13] frank: If I load bot even through black vntz2, bot does not appear in the list
[20.08.21 10:06:17] angelo: question
[20.08.21 10:06:24] angelo: what do you mean by loading bot through black?
[20.08.21 10:06:33] angelo: there you can only run the module itself
[20.08.21 10:06:45] angelo: or I don't understand the launch logarithm
[20.08.21 10:12:09] frank: Yeah
[20.08.21 10:12:15] frank: Basically duplicating
[20.08.21 10:13:59] frank: They say there's a problem with the gasket
[20.08.21 10:14:30] angelo: I'm taking a 10-minute shower and I'll be here
[20.08.21 10:50:16] angelo: so the problem is only in the gasket now ?
[20.08.21 11:06:39] frank: It's okay, we got it.
[20.08.21 11:06:47] angelo: okay.
[20.08.21 11:06:57] angelo: I'll start the zeus group

[20.08.21 11:07:16] frank: Get is not working
[20.08.21 11:11:40] angelo: Tell gett to work
[20.08.21 12:21:48] angelo: maybe you should try to run it?

[20.08.21 13:33:11] angelo: it went like this
[20.08.21 13:33:29] frank: Yes, confirmed that vntz itself is down
[20.08.21 13:33:37] frank: Passed it on
[20.08.21 13:33:46] angelo: I want to try
[20.08.21 13:33:48] frank: Thanks for the test
[20.08.21 13:34:05] angelo: Can I ask you a question?
[20.08.21 13:34:08] angelo: I'll distract you.
[20.08.21 13:34:17] angelo: here are two lines of VNS and Sox
[20.08.21 13:34:22] angelo: what is the difference?
[20.08.21 13:34:25] angelo: what's the connection
[20.08.21 13:34:39] frank: And you watch through the virtual?) I wonder, there are real users sitting there moving the mouse?)
Well, in theory, does not work yet.
[20.08.21 13:35:02] frank: Caesar's working on it.
[20.08.21 13:35:36] angelo: I only go to the test ones.)
[20.08.21 13:35:42] angelo: but client said sometimes they jerk off there )))
[20.08.21 13:35:43] frank: There all actions in the panel are logged if anything
[20.08.21 13:35:46] angelo: there's a webcam ))
[20.08.21 13:36:03] frank: I see everything))
[20.08.21 13:36:09] frank: Okay.
[20.08.21 13:36:46] angelo: I'm too scared to go into combat
[20.08.21 13:36:49] frank: I'll write as soon as it's done,
[20.08.21 13:36:57] angelo: Okay.
[20.08.21 13:37:03] angelo: but still
[20.08.21 13:37:10] angelo: VNC:195.123.212.155:9093:KCj+6no7 Socks:195.123.212.155:9092:C4793B7A:EAFE2828
[20.08.21 13:37:14] angelo: what's the purpose here?!
[20.08.21 13:37:28] frank: Well, I would not advise it)
There are logs on all users.
It's the login data.
[20.08.21 13:37:49] frank: Then Adam will come and shine a lamp in his face at 3 in the morning.)
[20.08.21 13:37:54] angelo: and the logs lead ... What are you talking about now?)
[20.08.21 13:37:58] angelo: Aah!
[20.08.21 13:37:59] angelo: aah

[20.08.21 13:38:14] angelo: logs
[20.08.21 13:38:15] frank: I don't know.)
[20.08.21 13:38:40] angelo: well, the client offered me to come in and see what the hell is not working, but I refused
[20.08.21 13:38:43] angelo: fuck it
[20.08.21 13:38:45] angelo: whatever
[20.08.21 13:38:47] frank: )))
[20.08.21 13:39:02] angelo: although I'd like to see the webcam) ahahahah
[20.08.21 13:39:22] angelo: come on, write down what VNC and Sox are for
[20.08.21 13:39:30] angelo: here
[20.08.21 13:39:30] angelo: VNC:195.123.212.155:9093:KCj+6no7 Socks:195.123.212.155:9092:C4793B7A:EAFE2828
[20.08.21 13:39:36] frank: I don't know.
[20.08.21 13:39:43] angelo: got it.
[20.08.21 13:40:00] frank: Here's the data, you were told to test it
[20.08.21 13:40:03] frank: Yeah.
[20.08.21 13:40:17] frank: Well it's coming out, I'm waiting what they say next
[20.08.21 13:40:23] angelo: Roger that.
[20.08.21 13:40:25] angelo: poor clients
[20.08.21 13:41:08] angelo: what do you think
[20.08.21 13:41:13] angelo: are we being read here?
[20.08.21 13:41:22] angelo: in the rocket
[20.08.21 13:41:24] frank: I think they can.
[20.08.21 13:41:25] angelo: Are they shooting?
[20.08.21 13:41:32] angelo: That's what I think.
[20.08.21 13:43:38] frank: Well if they read it they'll understand that we both don't touch Vnts, because we piss
And we're interested.
And adam's a frequent nightly texting with urgent tascas, and we love him, fondly for it.
Not a big deal.
[20.08.21 13:44:03] angelo: ahahaha))
[20.08.21 13:44:10] angelo: well, bro, i'm not talking about us right now.)
[20.08.21 13:44:13] angelo: but in general
[20.08.21 13:44:25] frank: Yeah.
[20.08.21 13:44:43] angelo: I certainly don't write any information, like: look, it's a picture on my insta
[20.08.21 13:44:57] angelo: but go to my facebook account
[20.08.21 13:45:26] angelo: that's why there's an external toad
[20.08.21 13:47:17] frank: There's a lot of spam there.
And there's pgp and corporate.
[20.08.21 15:42:26] angelo: they are silent ?
[20.08.21 15:42:38] angelo: silence ?
[20.08.21 15:42:43] frank: It's working so far
[20.08.21 15:43:11] angelo: uh, what do i have to do ?
[20.08.21 15:43:13] angelo: I'm on dnog
[20.08.21 15:43:19] angelo: pressing get
[20.08.21 15:43:22] frank: go
[20.08.21 15:43:24] frank: Then get
[20.08.21 15:43:28] frank: And connect
[20.08.21 15:44:31] angelo: Error.
Server give answer, but do not send VNC params. Close dialog and try again.
[20.08.21 15:44:34] angelo: well, dude.
[20.08.21 15:47:41] angelo: ok
[20.08.21 15:54:04] angelo: works directly, not with sock
[20.08.21 17:00:21] angelo: chrome doesn't fucking work
[20.08.21 17:00:51] frank: I'm aware of the problem
[20.08.21 17:00:53] frank: They're solving it.
[23.08.21 08:51:31] angelo: Hey, bro.
[23.08.21 08:51:38] angelo: how's the vntz ?
[08.23.08.21 08:57:54] frank: They say it doesn't work like it should
[08.23.08.21 08:57:55] frank: Hey.
[23.08.21 08:58:00] frank: And if you change the port, it works.
[08.23.08.21 08:58:18] frank: 8083... It's strange in general.
[23.08.21 09:10:33] angelo: Anyway, I can check
[23.08.21 09:11:20] frank: Okay, I'll text you when I'm done.
[23.08.21 09:11:29] angelo: Okay.
[23.08.21 11:49:24] angelo: here ?
[23.08.21 11:49:34] angelo: how long does it take for the bot to upload to the repository ?
[23.08.21 12:48:44] angelo: B39571EFB42B19B8FD5FEA1933DD187F
[23.08.21 12:48:50] angelo: here I can't find it in two admins
[23.08.21 12:48:54] angelo: in vaults
[23.08.21 12:48:59] angelo: why ?!
[23.08.21 12:49:16] angelo: Tell me wai
[23.08.21 12:52:18] frank: It's on dnog7
[23.08.21 12:52:33] frank: I mean, which one should it be?
[23.08.21 12:52:48] angelo: well, it's probably on the bottom
[23.08.21 12:52:55] angelo: but I look both there and on Auction
[23.08.21 12:53:00] angelo: not in both
[23.08.21 13:13:55] frank: ok sec
[23.08.21 13:15:10] frank: Most likely on dnog they replaced the network module
[23.08.21 13:15:17] frank: I'll fix it.
[23.08.21 13:17:54] frank: The right server isn't working
[23.08.21 13:17:58] frank: Waiting for a lift
[23.08.21 13:26:05] angelo: I was told by the client about Zeus that often the bot didn't reach the panel
[23.08.21 13:26:08] angelo: This is the first time I had a problem
[23.08.21 13:27:23] frank: There's a part of the system fell off on the bottom
[23.08.21 13:27:26] frank: We're fixing it
[23.08.21 15:20:04] angelo: how long do you think it will take ?
[23.08.21 15:26:56] frank: I don't know.
[23.08.21 15:27:06] frank: Adam's on a roll.
[23.08.21 15:27:36] angelo: well, can i run vntz now somehow ?
[23.08.21 15:27:39] angelo: or not yet ?
[23.08.21 15:32:07] frank: while you can try on Auction
[24.08.21 14:33:41] angelo: hi
[24.08.21 14:33:52] angelo: well, I can not get into vnts (
[24.08.21 14:33:57] angelo: maybe I'm a crook
[24.08.21 14:39:34] frank: I don't know, ask Adam or Caesar
[24.08.21 14:40:38] angelo: I'll fuck you up)))
[24.08.21 14:40:41] angelo: I think I got it.
[24.08.21 14:41:34] frank: No. The point is, they are responsible for vnts)
[24.08.21 14:41:50] angelo: yeah, got you.
[24.08.21 17:26:15] angelo: who's in charge of the gaskets?
[24.08.21 17:26:21] angelo: maybe they're dead again
[24.08.21 17:33:11] frank: duplicate not come
[24.08.21 17:38:17] angelo: Who's the gasket?

[24.08.21 17:40:37] angelo: Yeah.
[24.08.21 17:40:39] angelo: fuck

[24.08.21 17:41:20] frank: I don't know

[02.09.21 12:50:48] angelo: 69F371F799F2833B6FB974F5FF9B31D1
[02.09.21 12:50:52] angelo: can't understand

[02.09.21 12:52:27] frank: They should be in the black
[02.09.21 12:52:38] angelo: Yeah, I already started VNC
[02.09.21 12:52:42] angelo: but it's gone somewhere

[30.09.21 12:17:32] angelo: ahahaha

[30.09.21 12:18:35] frank: In 10 min I will answer on tests.
[30.09.21 12:18:44] angelo: I remember I was depressed about it for a month, almost told him to fuck off
[30.09.21 12:18:47] angelo: ok
[09/30/21/12:19:04] frank: 8BB389BF844BF7031DF8F3373B73EEAF
This is the one on dnog you have access to?
And in black can you see it?
[30.09.21 12:19:18] angelo: duh.
[30.09.21 12:19:20] angelo: I'll check it out
[30.09.21 12:19:40] frank: If so, you have to restart pvgrab and check if he gets the processes.
[30.09.21 12:26:07] angelo: is there a full name of the bot?
[30.09.21 12:26:36] angelo: can't find it by ID
[30.09.21 12:29:16] frank: 4B2MC32_W617601.8BB389BF844BF7031DF8F3373B73EEAF
[30.09.21 12:29:53] angelo: can't find it for some reason
[30.09.21 12:30:01] frank: hmm
[30.09.21 12:30:09] angelo: cceqv5 and kwwka7
[30.09.21 12:30:10] angelo: no
[30.09.21 12:30:24] frank: kwwka
[30.09.21 12:30:27] frank: must be
[30.09.21 12:30:28] frank: sec
[30.09.21 12:30:35] frank: What's your nickname there?
[30.09.21 12:30:45] angelo: root
[30.09.21 12:30:57] frank: ah
[30.09.21 12:34:01] frank: https://kwwka7ark3ynr7k7.onion/log/17261576
[30.09.21 12:37:38] angelo: yes
[30.09.21 12:37:54] angelo: running pwgrabb
[30.09.21 12:37:55] angelo: ?
[30.09.21 12:39:38] frank: Well, if you drill into it all, and do it thoroughly
It turns out you need to take directly to the repository and watch the sample.
For example 20 bots need to find where the grabber worked and make a report.

Like
Bot - 8BB389BF844BF7031DF8F3373B73EEAF
2. info in black about pwgrabc (yes/no)
3. the presence of info in black about pwgrabb (yes/no)
4. Presence of passwords in the repository (yes/no, for which browsers)
5. 5. Presence of cookies in the repository (yes/no, for which browsers)
6. Result Works/No works (Works if there are cookies and passwords on all browsers)
[30.09.21 12:41:01] angelo: hmm, got it.
[30.09.21 12:41:27] angelo: so what's the problem ?
[30.09.21 12:41:39] angelo: looking for where robber robbed passwords ?
[30.09.21 12:42:10] frank: Yes, and cookies, so the client is complaining about passwords and no cookies
[30.09.21 12:42:28] angelo: where to look for cookies ?
[30.09.21 12:42:35] angelo: I'm not familiar with them
[30.09.21 12:43:32] frank: This is the first tab on the bot card
[30.09.21 12:43:45] frank: In the vault, there's a business card icon
[30.09.21 12:45:04] frank: Look at zev* group
[30.09.21 12:45:06] angelo: in dnog yes ?
[30.09.21 12:45:23] frank: yes
[30.09.21 12:50:47] angelo: so on that bot you said to restart the grabber
[30.09.21 12:50:49] angelo: restart ?
[30.09.21 12:51:08] frank: Yes
[30.09.21 12:51:16] frank: Don't report yet
[30.09.21 12:51:17] angelo: sec
[30.09.21 12:51:19] frank: It seems to be unnecessary.
[30.09.21 12:51:56] angelo: couple of minutes, bro, I'm getting distracted here
[30.09.21 12:55:22] angelo: and what command to grabber ?
[30.09.21 12:55:42] angelo: pwgrabb start ?
[30.09.21 12:55:48] frank: yes
[30.09.21 12:55:52] frank: and pwgrabc
[30.09.21 12:56:20] angelo: only pwgrabb
[30.09.21 12:57:06] angelo: ran both
[30.09.21 13:07:08] angelo: how they differ from each other ?
[30.09.21 13:07:18] angelo: pwgrabb and pwgrabc
[30.09.21 13:07:27] frank: they pull different things
[30.09.21 13:07:50] frank: There's a browser password in one and all kinds of filesilla git and stuff in the other one
[30.09.21 13:08:21] angelo: Yeah, I get it now
[30.09.21 13:09:18] angelo: I just opened cookies from the bot you wrote
[30.09.21 13:09:31] angelo: there are a lot of cookies and you don't know what the hell it is
[30.09.21 13:09:43] angelo: like

[30.09.21 13:10:33] angelo: shit, I don't understand you either.)
[30.09.21 13:10:42] frank: Something in base 64)
[30.09.21 13:11:00] angelo: ah, so even in bot we see encrypted cookies

[30.09.21 13:11:15] angelo: anyway modules were restarted at 4B2MC32_W617601.8BB389BF844BF7031DF8F3373B73EEAF

pwgrabc is running
no pwgrabb
no cookies
no passwords
[30.09.21 13:18:36] angelo: like this ?
[30.09.21 13:20:08] angelo: I just do not understand why the robber modules are not loaded on all bots ?
[30.09.21 13:20:19] angelo: I look now, and bots work without them
[30.09.21 13:22:25] frank: Good question.
[30.09.21 13:22:49] frank: You can write in general, but as far as I know grabber is in autorun
[30.09.21 13:23:09] frank: And it should start automatically after the bot is fixed in the system
[30.09.21 13:23:46] angelo: well, yeah
[30.09.21 13:23:52] angelo: I remember it's on autostart
[30.09.21 13:24:37] angelo: man, you know what I want to say - you're the most concrete guy here) on problem solving and problem structuring
[30.09.21 13:25:48] frank: I guess. I have enough knowledge and experience.
And when I talk to customers I am a star))).
[30.09.21 13:26:24] frank: I'm coming back from vacation, I see a lot of new things that I never noticed in routine.
[30.09.21 13:26:56] angelo: I look at you and feel envy ) hell, I want to be like you =)
[30.09.21 13:27:03] angelo: head !
[30.09.21 13:33:28] angelo: sorry, where to look Silver said ?
[30.09.21 13:35:16] frank: Well every bot has a parameter
[30.09.21 13:35:23] frank: it's like the importance of this bot
[30.09.21 13:35:34] angelo: 44
[30.09.21 13:35:36] angelo: and 22
[30.09.21 13:35:37] angelo: remember
[30.09.21 13:35:46] frank: 44 is normal.
[30.09.21 13:35:50] frank: That's a normal bot
[30.09.21 13:35:51] angelo: Yeah
[30.09.21 13:35:55] angelo: so not a bot
[30.09.21 13:35:56] frank: 22 isn't enough
[30.09.21 13:43:27] angelo: listen, Silver said about the old module
[30.09.21 13:43:39] angelo: there are bots where grabber was running in July and there was no reset
[30.09.21 13:43:45] angelo: and cookies are new and passwords
[30.09.21 13:43:50] angelo: from senbyar
[30.09.21 13:43:57] angelo: and the modules were started in July
[30.09.21 13:44:25] frank: well, pvgrab is fresh from August 31st
[30.09.21 13:45:20] angelo: https://kwwka7ark3ynr7k7.onion/log/13974744
[30.09.21 13:45:23] angelo: well, here's an example
[30.09.21 13:45:42] angelo: I don't see the last robber runs for a couple of months
[30.09.21 13:45:50] angelo: but cookies are freshly robbed
[30.09.21 13:46:04] angelo: that's because Silver there mentioned old unupdated grabber
[30.09.21 13:46:28] frank: Yes, if there is no reset it might be
[30.09.21 13:46:35] frank: Old format gets robbed
[30.09.21 13:46:56] frank: I usually ask all bots to restart some adam module in this case
[30.09.21 14:20:18] frank: By the way, can you check your mail?
[30.09.21 14:34:37] angelo: um not
[30.09.21 14:34:37] angelo: didn't even know what you were talking about
[30.09.21 15:12:35] angelo: i don't understand adam
[30.09.21 15:18:55] angelo: I have 2019 7 and 10
[30.09.21 15:19:17] frank: You have to enter from 3 browsers in them
[30.09.21 15:19:35] frank: And check that sends all the data processes, cookies, formgrabber
[30.09.21 15:19:55] angelo: I start itport module and which graber ?
[30.09.21 15:20:07] angelo: both ?
[30.09.21 15:29:33] frank: Yes
[30.09.21 15:30:06] angelo: tell me what about the browsers ? History, passwords/logs
[30.09.21 15:30:09] angelo: what else ?
[30.09.21 15:30:28] angelo: what/how to collect cookies ?
[30.09.21 15:31:17] frank: processes, formgrabber, cookies
[30.09.21 15:38:07] angelo: what are processes ?
[30.09.21 15:38:15] angelo: better to ask
[30.09.21 15:38:26] frank: these are passwords and logins
[30.09.21 15:38:32] frank: And other sites
[30.09.21 15:38:37] frank: Accesses are
[30.09.21 15:38:40] angelo: didn't know that slang
[30.09.21 15:39:15] frank: In the admin area they are called like that, that's probably why they use that name
[30.09.21 15:39:19] angelo: I got it, not the Access Office.)
[30.09.21 15:39:27] frank: That's basically all the data that goes into the appropriate section
[30.09.21 16:15:52] frank: Look, you need 3-4 references to check
[30.09.21 16:16:07] frank: I ran them on three browsers
[30.09.21 16:16:18] frank: And played the data
[30.09.21 16:16:25] frank: I did it for all systems
[30.09.21 16:16:31] frank: Then told me the bots
[30.09.21 16:16:38] frank: And I looked again at what was coming in
[30.09.21 16:16:46] frank: Just in case something got lost
[30.09.21 16:17:26] angelo: sorry for stupid questions
[30.09.21 16:17:30] angelo: I got attacked here
[30.09.21 16:17:39] angelo: 3-4 links

[24.11.21 07:45:21] angelo: ok
[24.11.21 09:35:59] frank: And you still gotta try to make one fix
[24.11.21 09:36:21] angelo: got it

[24.11.21 12:34:38] frank: Okay.
[24.11.21 12:39:45] frank: The first one got a cookie.
[24.11.21 12:39:50] frank: They take a long time there
[24.11.21 12:41:16] angelo: got it
[24.11.21 12:41:20] angelo: let's check it out
[24.11.21 13:01:47] angelo: there are two files
[24.11.21 13:01:53] angelo: not separated by browsers
[24.11.21 13:02:03] angelo: 3BB3B733F7F7FBB3B73BB373FBB3B377_cookies and 3BB3B733F7FBB3B73BB373FBB3B377_cookies_raw
[24.11.21 13:02:19] angelo: on auction
[11/24/21/221 13:02:29] frank: Yeah. Got it.
[24.11.21 16:00:41] frank: Try again at auction, corrected his upload
[24.11.21 16:00:54] frank: As soon as possible.
[24.11.21 16:01:31] angelo: ok
[24.11.21 16:01:34] angelo: ok

[25.11.21 09:18:07] angelo: HJSdshdo8282023
[25.11.21 09:22:53] angelo: like this file, there is also Login Date
[25.11.21 09:23:31] frank: Is it big by volume?
[25.11.21 09:23:41] angelo: 40Kb
[25.11.21 09:24:08] frank: Download both of them again, I can't find it
[25.11.21 09:24:59] angelo: two
[25.11.21 09:25:08] angelo: is it from VM and admin ?
[25.11.21 09:25:29] frank: Well you say there is more file)
[25.11.21 09:25:41] angelo: aah
[25.11.21 09:25:47] angelo: but it doesn't take cookies at all
[25.11.21 09:25:50] frank: Just send it again
[25.11.21 09:25:54] angelo: ok
[25.11.21 09:26:30] angelo: MSUdh82oh2rrr
[25.11.21 09:27:06] angelo: https://file.io/osr4CUT8mqAk
[25.11.21 09:30:45] frank: It seems to work...
Try again with the mediocrity.
Or as an option once again on another machine...
Or roll this one back.
[25.11.21 09:30:48] frank: I don't know the best way
[25.11.21 09:31:31] angelo: yeah
[25.11.21 09:31:31] frank: I remember that nicholas used to take those cookies
[25.11.21 09:31:38] angelo: already started another car
[25.11.21 09:31:41] angelo: let me try
[25.11.21 09:31:51] angelo: where is it by the way ?
[25.11.21 09:54:08] frank: I think it's online
[25.11.21 09:58:42] angelo: I downloaded the modules on the new car
[25.11.21 09:58:50] angelo: waiting for cookies to bounce
[25.11.21 09:58:57] frank: ok
[25.11.21 10:14:40] angelo: heimey says not session cookies are rolling
[25.11.21 10:14:45] angelo: from panel
[25.11.21 10:21:36] frank: What do you mean non-sessionary7
[25.11.21 10:22:38] frank: Like not all? Or outdated?
[25.11.21 10:23:00] angelo: I can't tell, I asked Heimi
[25.11.21 10:23:13] angelo: <flip> well, when you log in, there's a cookie per session, what you kinda logged in to not ask for password later
[25.11.21 10:27:00] frank: haime?
[25.11.21 10:27:45] angelo: jaime
[25.11.21 10:28:00] angelo: flip in toad
[25.11.21 11:19:59] frank: Jamie said there's something wrong with cookies\
[25.11.21 11:20:08] frank: The way I understand it, there's nothing there.
[25.11.21 11:21:03] angelo: Yeah, I showed him the part
[25.11.21 11:21:08] angelo: and it's obviously empty
[25.11.21 11:21:19] angelo: and on VM they are encrypted
[25.11.21 11:27:20] frank: What's your time frame? Is it possible to check it 2 times?
[25.11.21 11:27:41] angelo: Time is fine.
[25.11.21 11:27:48] angelo: Second time cookies ?
[25.11.21 11:27:52] angelo: were there changes ?
[25.11.21 11:27:57] angelo: or just repeat ?
[25.11.21 11:28:39] frank: maybe on another VM
[25.11.21 11:29:12] frank: MB got it wrong there
[25.11.21 11:29:22] angelo: Aah
[25.11.21 11:29:26] frank: You don't leave the mail, do you?
[25.11.21 11:29:26] angelo: same cookies
[25.11.21 11:29:30] angelo: yes
[25.11.21 11:29:35] frank: Okay.
[25.11.21 13:05:28] frank: How's it going on the other vm?
[25.11.21 13:05:31] frank: Did it work?
[25.11.21 13:23:51] angelo: Nope.
[25.11.21 13:23:59] angelo: it's the same on the other one
[25.11.21 13:24:11] angelo: and the same cookies are rolling
[25.11.21 13:32:11] frank: Another question.
[25.11.21 13:32:22] frank: Do you copy that file into sphere?
[25.11.21 13:43:40] angelo: Yeah.
[25.11.21 13:45:15] angelo: what happened ?
[25.11.21 13:45:22] frank: 1:43 PM
Did he check that it was only the cookies that were formed when he logged in ? Cleared the rest of the cookies?
[25.11.21 13:45:25] angelo: after what got this ?
[25.11.21 13:46:36] frank: What exactly did it get?
[25.11.21 13:46:43] angelo: both clean and with other cookies
[25.11.21 13:46:51] angelo: What's the problem with cookies?
[25.11.21 13:47:03] angelo: somehow missed the point
[25.11.21 13:48:05] frank: Well, I rewrote cookie upload to storage
[25.11.21 13:48:17] frank: It's important to understand that they work on VM
[25.11.21 13:48:31] frank: You can just go to vm, go to gmail
[25.11.21 13:48:39] frank: Unload cookies and try to enter the sphere
[25.11.21 13:48:45] frank: Don't even need bots and modules
[25.11.21 13:49:00] frank: 1:45 PM
Isn't it enough that the VM is new?
1:48 PM.
No. He could go to another browser, for example, and cookies are formed there.
[25.11.21 13:49:02] angelo: well, locally dump the cookies from the car
[25.11.21 13:49:14] frank: Yeah.
[25.11.21 13:49:16] angelo: where are the cookies formed ?
[25.11.21 13:49:24] angelo: I get them from chrome
[25.11.21 13:49:39] frank: Probably in that file
[25.11.21 13:49:45] frank: The one you upload
[25.11.21 13:49:56] frank: I think all browsers are stored there
[25.11.21 13:50:03] angelo: C:\Users\Bil\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cookies
[25.11.21 13:50:11] angelo: how can they store everything here?!
[25.11.21 13:50:18] angelo: each browser has its own folders
[25.11.21 13:50:23] angelo: different storage location
[25.11.21 13:51:00] angelo: this point is not clear to me
[25.11.21 13:52:09] angelo: via admin - I grated cookies from Edge and FF
[25.11.21 13:52:26] angelo: so both locally and via bot (panel) everywhere only Chrome
[25.11.21 13:53:32] frank: ok, try just unload local cookies after logging into chrome, on a clean machine...
[25.11.21 13:53:51] frank: I dunno, if just local cookies don't work, what's the point of trying to find the problem in the code.
[25.11.21 13:56:00] angelo: wait a minute
[25.11.21 13:56:05] angelo: wait a minute
[25.11.21 13:56:14] angelo: we were pulling them out through a program
[25.11.21 13:56:16] angelo: from the database
[25.11.21 13:56:30] frank: No.
[25.11.21 13:56:36] angelo: why ?
[25.11.21 13:57:09] frank: 1:37 PM
When I took them out of the database manually, we just compared them to what the module had built.
And you can't use them directly in the sphere because they are encrypted.
You just need to run the module, and repeat the experiment completely, if necessary.
[25.11.21 13:57:17] frank: I see.
[25.11.21 13:57:50] angelo: Yeah, encrypted.
[25.11.21 13:57:55] angelo: so let's go again for the fool
[25.11.21 13:58:09] angelo: but how we can fill them locally into the Sphere?
[25.11.21 13:58:29] frank: In general, I understand. We can't pour these cookies directly into Sphere.
[25.11.21 13:59:03] angelo: so some kind of bug with the unloading of cookies in the panel yes ?
[25.11.21 14:01:47] frank: Mm-hmm.
[25.11.21 14:02:03] frank: So there is no way we can check the cookies before they get to the panel
[25.11.21 14:02:33] angelo: Yeah, well, obviously it should work
[25.11.21 14:03:34] frank: Send me the id of the last bot that checked for cookies, I will continue to tinker with the server.
[25.11.21 14:04:02] angelo: DESKTOP-5BAB9PU_W10019043.CEB3BC91CBF6B3BC79355B9BB465237C
[25.11.21 14:05:19] frank: Ok thanks for the help
[25.11.21 14:07:33] frank: So I'm supposed to insert the offload by idea and get into the mail when I log into gmail, from the sphere right7
[25.11.21 14:09:34] angelo: yes
[25.11.21 14:09:39] angelo: without password confirmation
[25.11.21 14:10:25] angelo: write if you want to run and check again
[25.11.21 14:10:47] frank: Okay.
[25.11.21 14:19:31] angelo: here's a trivial cookie comparison
[25.11.21 14:19:31] angelo: well, they're different from admin
[25.11.21 14:19:31] angelo: what I used to take from the server
[26.11.21 07:53:08] angelo: i'm writing you in toad
[26.11.21 07:53:20] frank: I've seen it, it's better to have it in one place
[26.11.21 07:53:26] angelo: found the last cookies
[26.11.21 07:53:28] frank: Is there an id in that log?
[26.11.21 07:53:29] angelo: working exactly
[26.11.21 07:53:32] frank: User.
[26.11.21 07:53:33] angelo: then
[26.11.21 07:53:45] angelo: in that old ?
[26.11.21 07:53:55] frank: Yes
[26.11.21 07:54:04] frank: You know, like look in the admin area
[26.11.21 07:54:32] frank: I need to run the auction again I just changed a bit, just tell me before starting to clean the logs
[26.11.21 07:54:50] frank: There is a strange thing in the logs are not those cookies that are in the admin
[26.11.21 07:55:09] angelo: lost somewhere
[26.11.21 07:55:15] angelo: id can't see
[26.11.21 07:55:24] frank: vj;tn bg
[26.11.21 07:55:26] frank: ip maybe?
[26.11.21 07:56:16] angelo: no ip
[26.11.21 08:01:22] frank: I deleted old logs, can you run the machine again, I'll try to check the logs
[26.11.21 08:01:43] frank: И ещё https://auk64p35qebertdsh576avhnswxdprft3kpmvsm5sixxof6bsbgryxqd.onion/logpost/more_ex/19D0A3B4937FD197BB2157B717F3BB73
If you try to enter it will not work?
[26.11.21 08:01:51] frank: There are 5 lines there now.
[26.11.21 08:17:58] angelo: bro I need 15 minutes
[26.11.21 08:18:04] angelo: ran out of fucking sticks
[26.11.21 08:18:06] angelo: okay?
[26.11.21 08:18:31] frank: Just now the trick)
If I enable the logs in the base on the repository will stop this whole system with cookies most likely )

And in the logs at the entrance to the proxy, there is nothing and no way to verify, I either need your help, or let you tell me how to test, I found the dedication, but still do not understand how and what to do there.
[26.11.21 08:18:34] frank: No problem
[26.11.21 08:18:52] frank: Let me know when you get back
[26.11.21 08:19:04] angelo: It's a deal.
[26.11.21 13:03:11] frank: Not in 20-40 minutes I'll have to leave.
[26.11.21 13:03:22] angelo: now
[26.11.21 13:03:27] angelo: throw the cookie on 180 ?)
[26.11.21 13:03:36] frank: Send me a dump of the dead bot
[26.11.21 13:03:52] frank: And try to run it on a clean machine and send me the dump
[26.11.21 13:03:59] frank: I think there's either something missing
[26.11.21 13:04:03] frank: Or it's not sending
[26.11.21 13:04:13] angelo: SDtoy829py28hesff
[26.11.21 13:04:19] angelo: ok
[26.11.21 13:04:50] angelo: https://file.io/3rmnSxPL9BFZ
[26.11.21 13:11:40] frank: How do I open it?
[26.11.21 13:12:23] angelo: ok
[26.11.21 13:13:03] angelo: https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
[26.11.21 13:16:10] frank: Okay. Write on the new bot, how's it going, and probably for today, that's all.
I'm going to, and at most I will compare the dump and try to figure out where the losses.
[26.11.21 13:16:47] angelo: already running the grabber
[26.11.21 13:18:43] angelo: in fact we only need pwgrabb ?
[26.11.21 13:20:05] frank: Yeah
[26.11.21 13:20:13] angelo: yeah
[26.11.21 13:20:15] frank: The network was just a test.
[26.11.21 13:20:18] frank: That bot works
[26.11.21 13:20:21] frank: But the module on the dnog doesn't
[26.11.21 13:20:26] frank: Not getting it right
[26.11.21 13:20:28] angelo: there's no second pwgrabc
[26.11.21 13:20:42] frank: Run it just in case
[26.11.21 13:20:47] frank: It's like a pass
[26.11.21 13:20:48] angelo: already
[26.11.21 13:21:04] frank: They didn't come to the previous ones, by the way
[26.11.21 13:21:21] angelo: I don't know
[26.11.21 13:21:32] angelo: strange bots die
[26.11.21 13:21:36] angelo: no caesar
[26.11.21 13:22:30] frank: He doesn't answer in toad7
[26.11.21 13:23:10] angelo: Damn, I didn't see him there
[26.11.21 13:23:12] angelo: Hof ?
[26.11.21 13:26:15] frank: Yeah.
[26.11.21 13:26:24] frank: I always text him there.

[26.11.21 13:32:14] angelo: 53 locally
[26.11.21 13:33:06] frank: 53 in base
[26.11.21 13:33:15] angelo: 52 in cookies
[26.11.21 13:33:18] angelo: like
[26.11.21 13:33:24] angelo: I'll count it now.)
[26.11.21 13:33:47] frank: )
[26.11.21 13:33:52] frank: And how much did the sphere take
[26.11.21 13:33:58] angelo: I didn't fill it up
[26.11.21 13:34:05] frank: Check it out
[26.11.21 13:34:45] angelo: 52 exactly
[26.11.21 13:39:00] frank: 53 in base
[26.11.21 13:39:00] frank: Okay.
[26.11.21 13:39:00] frank: Okay.
[26.11.21 13:39:17] frank: Try the sphere
[26.11.21 13:39:19] frank: What is it?
[26.11.21 13:39:23] angelo: Okay.
[26.11.21 13:39:29] angelo: but I don't think it'll work

[01.12.21 17:55:59] angelo: in about 15-20 minutes
[01.12.21 17:56:02] frank: Ah.
[01.12.21 17:56:19] angelo: I'll make a fist of it.)
[01.12.21 17:56:25] frank: ) Got it, well, see how you can
[01.12.21 18:06:36] angelo: you know
[01.12.21 18:06:58] angelo: only after giving birth can a woman understand how a man feels at 37.2
[01.12.21 18:12:09] frank: Viral trip.)
Before covid, people were muhmorrhaging, now it's like this.
[01.12.21 18:12:49] frank: I heard that if a person gets corona and cannot smell, it is enough to take 200 and it is ok, smells come through again, I have not checked it myself
[01.12.21 18:14:48] angelo: no, i don't want to check it) i'll just have laryngitis)
[01.12.21 18:14:53] angelo: but thanks =)
[01.12.21 18:16:53] frank: ))
Mine and I, when we were sick with covid, decided to get some cheap wine.
There were no smells and tastes, but from something we thought it was a hell of a good wine.
And when we recovered, we decided to repeat the pleasure, so to speak.
Except that no one in their right mind would not drink such a wine) And we praised it straight
[01.12.21 18:17:32] frank: You know, they cooked the meat, so it was a bummer
[01.12.21 18:17:45] frank: Get well.
[01.12.21 18:18:00] frank: Why are you at work?) If you're sick?)
[01.12.21 18:18:01] angelo: we threw away so much food last year.)
[01.12.21 18:18:07] angelo: I don't know.
[01.12.21 18:18:11] angelo: I always used to be here
[01.12.21 18:18:27] angelo: afraid of missing something
[01.12.21 18:18:31] angelo: and I'll become redundant
[01.12.21 18:18:52] frank: I see, and what did you throw away?
[01.12.21 18:19:07] angelo: they thought it was spoiled)
[01.12.21 18:19:15] frank: )))
[01.12.21 18:19:24] angelo: smells changed
[01.12.21 18:19:48] angelo: we made soup twice and all were puzzling how they could go sour =)
[01.12.21 18:20:00] angelo: and the meat is all rotten
[01.12.21 18:20:02] angelo: deer
[01.12.21 18:20:21] frank: I'm about to leave here myself.
As far as I feel about a month or two left, as I'll finish with old system and new guys will start to write, so I'll go.
[01.12.21 18:20:37] frank: Anything I can do to help.
[01.12.21 18:20:47] frank: But I decided I don't want to go on
[01.12.21 18:20:53] angelo: why ?
[01.12.21 18:20:57] angelo: too bad
[01.12.21 18:21:23] frank: My conscience is killing me. I don't want to spend my labor on it.
So. I've seen where this is going.
[01.12.21 18:21:40] angelo: conscience.... I understand you perfectly.
[01.12.21 18:21:51] angelo: And where this is going is already interesting
[01.12.21 18:21:54] frank: You cannot justify yourself, like I am an engineer, like Kalashnikov, I make weapons, but I do not shoot
[01.12.21 18:22:05] frank: Well, I was given a perspective
[01.12.21 18:22:11] frank: Kind of a lot of projects
[01.12.21 18:22:30] frank: Big plans, a lot to do.
[01.12.21 18:22:41] angelo: it will be hard to replace you.
[01.12.21 18:23:03] angelo: you made the right choice
[01.12.21 18:23:24] frank: Well, Tomas may work, if you stabilize it, you should be fine.
[01.12.21 18:23:52] angelo: Yeah, I think there's a change coming.
[01.12.21 18:24:07] angelo: something should change for sure and hopefully for the better
[01.12.21 18:24:15] angelo: but your choice is right, honest
[01.12.21 18:24:48] frank: I think it's hard to go from this easy money to a regular job)
[01.12.21 18:24:56] frank: Well, I hope I make it.
[01.12.21 18:25:13] angelo: Yes you can!
[01.12.21 18:25:19] angelo: with that kind of zeal
[01.12.21 18:25:23] angelo: with such responsibility!
[01.12.21 18:27:02] angelo: you have about 2?
[01.12.21 18:27:10] frank: Yes.
[01.12.21 18:27:17] angelo: as an admin it won't be that hard to find
[01.12.21 18:27:35] frank: The market is basically done. Right now, the salaries in php have skyrocketed a lot.
[01.12.21 18:27:47] angelo: Yeah.
[01.12.21 18:27:55] angelo: I look myself
[01.12.21 18:28:03] frank: I'm sorry I didn't finish it all, but I want to put the next 2 months into it.
[01.12.21 18:28:03] angelo: watching the market
[01.12.21 18:28:40] angelo: good for you, you're doing it, not everyone would
[01.12.21 18:29:11] frank: thanks for the confession :)
[01.12.21 18:29:16] angelo: you know, if i knew how to program and knew that i could become a meld or a project manager, i would probably quit
[01.12.21 18:29:20] angelo: Why would I lie, bro?
[01.12.21 18:29:24] angelo: i can see that
[01.12.21 18:29:54] angelo: you're a good guy with principles, that's worth a lot
[01.12.21 18:30:34] frank: I think you'll grow up. I think there's a so called career path and all that. If you try hard, everything is real, and some people earn 5 and 10.
[01.12.21 18:31:22] frank: It is important to learn something and be able to find opportunities to work through the experience you get.
[01.12.21 18:31:45] frank: In fact, there's always a higher level.
[01.12.21 18:32:02] angelo: I have my own plan, +- clear, understanding of the situation as a whole. But sometimes there is a reasonable question in my head, there is not conscience but common sense
[01.12.21 18:32:24] angelo: you see, the flip side of the Robes medal
[01.12.21 18:32:29] angelo: orange
[01.12.21 18:32:59] frank: Well, I have two ways.
One, that I somewhere will not agree, and given everything, this is the real way.
If in russia and you are valuable and you made a deal, they can pull me out...
[I was thinking about the possibility to get a job in Russia, but I was thinking about the possibility to get a job in Russia.
[01.12.21 18:34:04] frank: There's a path where I engineer, too, but it's not about my goals, I'm too eager to implement all that.
[01.12.21 18:34:34] frank: So everywhere you look, I see years ahead where I shake my ass)
[01.12.21 18:34:46] frank: And I step over my principles
[01.12.21 18:35:23] angelo: you really have other goals, I certainly do not have self-realization in professional terms. Only money for my family and children define my path, alas
[01.12.21 18:35:25] frank: Where is the moment when I push the button and someone loses his life, health, or family? I do not know, but if I do it, I want to be in the legal field.
[01.12.21 18:36:00] frank: It's like, it's one thing to fire someone or beat someone else in competition, and it's another thing to do it like this.
[01.12.21 18:36:07] frank: So these are my thoughts
[01.12.21 18:36:12] angelo: But I also have principles, otherwise I would have bred on Avito, but I don't change any outright fraud
[01.12.21 18:36:24] angelo: okay, it will be so !
[01.12.21 18:36:29] angelo: as it should be
[01.12.21 18:36:31] angelo: and not otherwise
[01.12.21 18:36:35] frank: )
[01.12.21 18:36:50] angelo: I'm sitting here myself and for months now I've been wondering who I see myself in the future
[01.12.21 18:38:36] frank: We are in a very big team, if you stay you will have everything in terms of money... Such structures don't die so easily, everything is too tied up as I understand it.
[01.12.21 18:39:48] angelo: I'm more than sure, all that's left is to learn some tricks.
[01.12.21 18:39:53] angelo: you too.)
[01.12.21 18:40:07] angelo: Haimi thinks the same of you
[01.12.21 18:40:18] angelo: we talked about you more than once )
[01.12.21 18:40:25] angelo: Flip
[01.12.21 18:40:26] frank: well, what can you do
[01.12.21 18:40:41] frank: Sad that I found my place in the black hat only for now))
[01.12.21 18:40:50] angelo: i remember jeremy leaving...........
[01.12.21 18:41:10] angelo: experience bro
[01.12.21 18:41:17] frank: Yeah.

[20.01.22 15:43:57] angelo: where to go if anything
[20.01.22 15:44:46] frank: I'm really down in the skin)
[20.01.22 15:44:57] angelo: I'm over 30 and dumb
[20.01.22 15:45:01] angelo: who is harder ?
[20.01.22 15:45:02] frank: I wonder if I can get the same job or I'll have to downgrade
[20.01.22 15:45:19] frank: I don't know.
It's always a question of necessary expenses
[20.01.22 15:45:38] angelo: What are you gonna do?
[20.01.22 15:45:41] angelo: which way ?
[20.01.22 15:46:00] frank: I was thinking about going to school, like skyang or lingvaleo.
[20.01.22 15:46:16] frank: The second option tourist sphere
[20.01.22 15:46:20] frank: I want to get away from money
[20.01.22 15:46:25] frank: Crypto banks and sales
[20.01.22 15:46:37] angelo: go to english then
[20.01.22 15:46:41] angelo: tourism lost a lot
[20.01.22 15:46:46] frank: Maybe if things get really bad I'll go to the plants and ERP
[20.01.22 15:46:53] angelo: The same Airbnb cut the staff and the same IT
[20.01.22 15:47:09] frank: Yeah.
[20.01.22 15:47:13] frank: Wildberries too
[20.01.22 15:47:18] angelo: ouch
[20.01.22 15:47:22] angelo: it's fucked up
[20.01.22 15:47:31] angelo: all the bands are taken.)
[20.01.22 15:47:36] angelo: ALL
[20.01.22 15:47:41] angelo: took out all of them)
[20.01.22 15:47:46] angelo: there were gray PIs
[20.01.22 15:48:05] angelo: it's easier for you
[20.01.22 15:48:09] angelo: there is a background
[20.01.22 15:48:16] angelo: that's why I wanted to ask you where to look
[20.01.22 15:48:17] angelo: what
[20.01.22 15:48:33] frank: It depends what you want. If you want money and just
[20.01.22 15:48:39] frank: Relatively
[20.01.22 15:48:47] frank: PHP is good stuff
[20.01.22 15:48:52] frank: And the web in general
[20.01.22 15:49:24] angelo: You want money and not to be left behind
[20.01.22 15:49:25] frank: If you want to learn a lot, you can go to Js or python developers
[20.01.22 15:49:31] angelo: I'm old...
[20.01.22 15:49:38] angelo: hmm
[20.01.22 15:50:01] angelo: and Web is for development ?
[20.01.22 15:50:06] frank: If you are out of business, you can go to 1C developer)
[20.01.22 15:50:16] frank: They always will...
[20.01.22 15:50:21] frank: But in general, I look like this
[20.01.22 15:50:31] frank: You need compensation while you study.
[20.01.22 15:51:20] frank: In php if you make a simple project in laravel and come to the interview with knowledge of REST API, the basic principles of coding and not a lot of talk about the database, no problem for 40k will take
[20.01.22 15:51:40] frank: It's kind of a question of task-solving skills.
[20.01.22 15:53:29] frank: It's good to have 2 weeks for theory.
About 4 weeks for the first test project, 10-15 hours a week if your memory is good.
[20.01.22 15:53:48] frank: You can even do it with google and stackoverflow.
[20.01.22 15:54:37] frank: Like. I want to make a recipe book for my wife.
What kind of tables and gist will it consist of?
What are the main pages and what kind of functionality it will have?
[20.01.22 15:55:00] frank: If you can answer it, you already have the skill to decompose the tasks.
[20.01.22 15:55:00] angelo: oy .... you just surprised me a lot about 40K
[20.01.22 15:55:30] frank: Next, what classes and methods will be, list the actions in rota.
[20.01.22 15:55:34] angelo: you need to go through the basics of Rest QCUL
[20.01.22 15:55:54] frank: answer write understanding of programming principles, you can without code even just interfaces.
[20.01.22 15:56:06] frank: And what function does what.
[20.01.22 15:56:12] frank: I'm already thinking
[20.01.22 15:56:19] frank: Maybe I should write a course
[20.01.22 15:56:37] frank: For all who want 40 k a month and quit a boring job)
[20.01.22 15:56:57] frank: Just well, from the side people lack a plan and faith in themselves.
[20.01.22 15:56:59] angelo: well, as an option
[20.01.22 15:57:05] frank: And not the lack of work or money in the field.
[20.01.22 15:57:19] angelo: this is a problem for many people
[20.01.22 15:57:23] angelo: insecurity
[20.01.22 15:57:28] angelo: what's it called
[20.01.22 15:57:32] angelo: syndrome
[20.01.22 15:57:37] angelo: a passerby
[20.01.22 15:57:41] frank: Then you sit down and write code, you'll have a million and one problems while you're doing it.
[20.01.22 15:58:30] frank: Go to google and search for coders chat, ask them questions, see who's answering, make a list with their nicknames and ask more complicated questions in their inbox
[20.01.22 15:58:46] angelo: well, yeah, so far I figured out one important thing
[20.01.22 15:58:51] angelo: google is arch important
[20.01.22 15:58:55] frank: You know how to fuck up your life, I think you'll get it easy with those who will move you.
[20.01.22 15:58:59] angelo: All questions are already answered in essence
[20.01.22 15:59:05] frank: turn
[20.01.22 15:59:34] angelo: well, my level of communication is not bad
[20.01.22 16:00:03] frank: And then you just wrote a conditional project and put in your resume, worked a year as a tester in a major project, in big strokes describe what you did, and at the interview tell them how you wrote your book of recipes
[20.01.22 16:00:20] angelo: yeah.
[20.01.22 16:00:22] angelo: that's by the way !
[20.01.22 16:00:31] frank: Everything, they look, independence is a plus, not a lot of money he wants, he knows how to communicate and he can fit into the team
[20.01.22 16:00:32] angelo: how will you describe the job ?
[20.01.22 16:00:34] frank: Happy ending
[20.01.22 16:00:39] angelo: )))
[20.01.22 16:00:44] angelo: you'd think so.)
[20.01.22 16:01:03] angelo: because often ask where exactly and who can recommend it
[20.01.22 16:01:07] frank: I'll tell you there was a sales department, you had to write a bunch of calls and keep the data
[20.01.22 16:01:13] angelo: or we want to talk to your team leader
[20.01.22 16:01:28] frank: There was a server where the calls were stored, there was an admin, you had to dock it all.
[20.01.22 16:01:35] frank: I have a Team Lead
[20.01.22 16:01:41] frank: They'll talk to him
[20.01.22 16:01:43] frank: )
[20.01.22 16:01:49] angelo: ))) clever
[20.01.22 16:01:52] frank: There was a legacy code
[20.01.22 16:02:03] frank: Company IE Ivanov, not represented on the wide market
[20.01.22 16:02:48] frank: I signed my NDA, I can not tell much, and it often does not matter to nobody.
[20.01.22 16:02:57] frank: I'll look for someone who will vouch
[20.01.22 16:03:09] angelo: yeah, I think so
[20.01.22 16:03:11] angelo: correct
[20.01.22 16:03:15] frank: I have previous places I can give contacts from there
[20.01.22 16:03:25] frank: That's important
[20.01.22 16:03:36] frank: Experience, independence, and how people fit in.
[20.01.22 16:03:46] angelo: I would never think
[20.01.22 16:03:55] angelo: that communication is important
[20.01.22 16:03:55] frank: Previous places ask for backup
[20.01.22 16:04:03] frank: Not everyone cares
[20.01.22 16:04:17] frank: Many people have contacts at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, they check for criminal records
[20.01.22 16:04:28] frank: And for criminal records.
[20.01.22 16:04:48] angelo: No way.
[20.01.22 16:05:01] frank: I had a drunken conversation with a guy at work.
[20.01.22 16:05:06] frank: I don't know how it works
[20.01.22 16:05:11] angelo: I got a job last time in 2007 or so
[20.01.22 16:05:35] frank: Well, you'll say I worked different jobs, and I was a tester
[20.01.22 16:05:53] frank: To find a coder who can confidently pretend to be a team leader, I think it's not a big problem...
[20.01.22 16:06:13] frank: like if they start punching
[20.01.22 16:06:29] frank: For 40k many other companies will want to take you without verification
[20.01.22 16:06:41] frank: It's not much money by the standards of different companies
[20.01.22 16:06:45] frank: Developers are cheeky
[20.01.22 16:06:53] frank: They won't do anything for less than 100
[20.01.22 16:07:01] frank: It's profitable to take qualified Juns
[20.01.22 16:07:12] frank: Especially if there is a system of guiding and mentoring
[20.01.22 16:07:18] frank: Within the firm\.
[20.01.22 16:07:25] angelo: thank you for the longread on the subject, it's something to think about and think about.
[20.01.22 16:07:40] angelo: to Sberbank is good of course.
[20.01.22 16:07:49] angelo: I have a couple of guys working there
[20.01.22 16:07:57] angelo: one lives worse than us
[20.01.22 16:08:03] frank: )
[20.01.22 16:08:09] frank: Also an option
[20.01.22 16:08:13] angelo: annual bonuses of 1 lakh+
[20.01.22 16:08:20] angelo: zap 300+
[20.01.22 16:08:29] angelo: haven't seen below 150 there
[20.01.22 16:08:31] frank: If it were calmer inside my family and not all on me I would go into reverse engineering
[20.01.22 16:08:54] frank: I liked watching the malware research
[20.01.22 16:09:02] angelo: by the way
[20.01.22 16:09:02] frank: While I was working here I read different stuff
[20.01.22 16:09:07] frank: I didn't understand half of it
[20.01.22 16:09:08] angelo: It's really interesting
[20.01.22 16:09:15] frank: But as I understood it
[20.01.22 16:09:17] angelo: on IB
[20.01.22 16:09:19] frank: Everything is predictable
[20.01.22 16:09:31] frank: Like there are standard virus writers' tricks
[20.01.22 16:09:35] frank: And exploitation
[20.01.22 16:09:36] angelo: sorry for prying..... what's with the family?!
[20.01.22 16:10:02] angelo: I would go to IB, the topic is more relevant than ever
[20.01.22 16:10:03] frank: Well, a loved one is sick, you need to pay for the treatment.
[20.01.22 16:10:18] angelo: sorry.
[20.01.22 16:10:31] frank: Yes, it's sad, but I got used to it.
[20.01.22 16:10:46] frank: Yeah EB is cool
[20.01.22 16:10:49] angelo: stay, find it and go
[20.01.22 16:10:56] angelo: why to the void
[20.01.22 16:10:58] angelo: or whatever
[20.01.22 16:11:03] frank: I can find it quickly.
[20.01.22 16:11:09] angelo: I liked it myself
[20.01.22 16:11:18] frank: I'll start looking 3 weeks before the last day
[20.01.22 16:11:38] frank: Exactly in reverse you have to sit a lot
[20.01.22 16:11:45] frank: And a lot of digging
[20.01.22 16:12:01] frank: I think it's about diligence and patience
[20.01.22 16:12:17] frank: I have a lot of both, and their salaries are high
[20.01.22 16:12:28] angelo: That's for you )))))
[20.01.22 16:12:32] angelo: you are patient
[20.01.22 16:12:35] frank: I don't understand it well yet
[20.01.22 16:12:37] angelo: you work!
[20.01.22 16:12:41] frank: What's the base threshold
[20.01.22 16:12:55] frank: Last month, 1.% I do nothing much
[20.01.22 16:12:58] frank: I support it rather
[20.01.22 16:13:17] frank: I did a lot before that.
[20.01.22 16:13:33] frank: I don't know, I'm just kind of depressed.
[20.01.22 16:13:52] angelo: It's still winter.
[20.01.22 16:13:55] frank: Kind of.
[20.01.22 16:14:09] angelo: I'm depressed myself
[20.01.22 16:14:20] angelo: that's why I don't drink any alcohol, not to make it worse
[20.01.22 16:14:24] frank: )
[20.01.22 16:14:35] angelo: don't look at general chat room )
[20.01.22 16:14:57] frank: ))))
[20.01.22 16:15:58] frank: I'm telling you, if you know how to communicate, getting a job as a coder is not that hard.
I've seen different ones there with it bad for a lot of people who are good at softskills, live well there.
We had cadres working.
[20.01.22 16:16:05] frank: There was one who was obsessed with cleanliness
[20.01.22 16:16:12] frank: Another wasn't drunk on principle
[20.01.22 16:16:17] frank: washed
[20.01.22 16:16:24] frank: They had such wars there
[20.01.22 16:16:42] angelo: that's so funny
[20.01.22 16:16:49] frank: I thought it was only in movies about madhouse.)
[20.01.22 16:16:58] frank: And these are coders with salaries over 150k
[20.01.22 16:17:05] frank: That was really rough
[20.01.22 16:17:27] angelo: poor project managers
[20.01.22 16:17:30] frank: Anyway, I don't know how I helped you.
[20.01.22 16:17:47] frank: That's the way it is with the web.
If in other spheres I don't know.
[20.01.22 16:18:05] frank: As they say, did not swim. do not know.
[20.01.22 16:18:06] angelo: I did.
[20.01.22 16:18:25] angelo: praise already, thanks, I have trouble with confidence in my abilities
[20.01.22 16:18:48] frank: just let yourself try.
[20.01.22 16:18:56] frank: Take a ball, make a resume
[20.01.22 16:19:05] frank: Kind of a tester, know basic php.
[20.01.22 16:19:16] frank: Salary 40
[20.01.22 16:19:24] frank: See how much they write and call
[20.01.22 16:19:42] frank: If there'll be a lot, you'll learn and go to the interview
[20.01.22 16:19:42] angelo: I met A.Chars here, girls.
[20.01.22 16:20:08] angelo: thanks bro!
[20.01.22 16:20:13] angelo: when did you decide ?
[20.01.22 16:20:18] frank: You don't have much to lose.
[20.01.22 16:20:25] frank: 25 February is the last day
[20.01.22 16:20:38] frank: I'll make an external toad for connection and format both computers)
[20.01.22 16:20:42] angelo: well, sur - there's still time )
[20.01.22 16:21:02] angelo: you want to keep in touch with someone?
[20.01.22 16:21:02] frank: I'll write how I'll wind up.
[20.01.22 16:21:12] frank: yeah, first month-2
[20.01.22 16:21:12] angelo: I'll definitely communicate with a couple
[20.01.22 16:21:22] frank: And plus if they catch me to unsubscribe.
[20.01.22 16:21:22] angelo: write !
[20.01.22 16:21:35] angelo: also a variant, man
[20.01.22 16:21:35] frank: I'll stay in touch anyway.
[20.01.22 16:21:58] frank: As if I really want to get back
[20.01.22 16:22:06] angelo: ahahah
[20.01.22 16:22:07] frank: Or maybe I'll get serious
[20.01.22 16:22:14] angelo: I'm used to communicating in General's format
[20.01.22 16:22:15] frank: Anything happens in life.
[20.01.22 16:22:20] angelo: exactly
[20.01.22 16:22:26] angelo: fools burn bridges
[20.01.22 16:23:19] frank: ) Relationships are very important, I pity that only with age I understood before, like from the heart of my eye and here goes
[20.01.22 16:23:52] frank: Four years of experience have been wasted in the field.
[20.01.22 16:26:12] angelo: yeah. i used to fuck everything up, people too
[20.01.22 16:26:36] angelo: but life is complicated, a lot more complicated and sometimes more interesting than in books
[21.02.22 17:58:47] frank: See how it is.
[21.02.22 17:58:52] angelo: hi!
[21.02.22 17:58:54] angelo: yeah
[21.02.22 17:59:01] angelo: that's to be expected
[21.02.22 17:59:13] frank: At least drop your toad, I'll add you too when I clean up my highlights.
[21.02.22 17:59:23] angelo: sure !
[21.02.22 17:59:30] angelo: I was dumb, and yesterday I thought you were done
[21.02.22 17:59:47] frank: Nah, I'm up to 25)
[21.02.22 18:00:00] frank: I felt it.
[21.02.22 18:00:43] angelo: https://privnote.com/BWfR4Wt5#eTYPds8bU
[21.02.22 18:00:51] angelo: you knew )
[21.02.22 18:00:55] frank: They started crypto in summer, I remember reading it and thinking, well, something will happen before New Year.
[21.02.22 18:01:15] frank: It's like all these laws about miners and our guys.
[21.02.22 18:01:29] angelo: Yeah, it wasn't just for fun
[21.02.22 18:01:35] angelo: I don't know what will happen next and how it will happen next
[21.02.22 18:02:00] frank: Well, it's true...
[21.02.22 18:02:06] angelo: it's all intertwined
[21.02.22 18:02:11] angelo: bands with other bands
[21.02.22 18:02:14] angelo: whole web
[21.02.22 18:03:16] frank: Well, Silver said that if something like this happens, everyone will lay low, and they won't give any more help
[21.02.22 18:09:08] frank: But in any case, it was a fun experience
While of course it looks like we're pussies who leave the camp, and say that well we'll call, write
In general, thanks for the company, it was a pleasure to work with you, probably few people here I'll say that.
[21.02.22 18:10:06] angelo: geez))) bro you touched me )))) I am so glad ! Heimi and I always look at you and say to each other - well, Frank is a cyborg !
[21.02.22 18:10:10] angelo: you're good !
[21.02.22 18:10:37] frank: :))
[21.02.22 18:11:13] angelo: i knew a lot of guys here
[21.02.22 18:11:17] angelo: under 60 people
[21.02.22 18:11:28] angelo: you're one of the right ones
[21.02.22 18:11:38] angelo: and competent
[21.02.22 18:13:47] frank: Thank you, I think we'll talk when everything is settled.
[21.02.22 18:13:51] angelo: join toad after ;)
[21.02.22 18:13:55] angelo: ok )))
