[12/24/21 10:40:49] angelo: Strip all network adapter Mac adress
[24.12.21 10:41:17] angelo: I don't know what's the right way, I need the image machine to be a new machine not a clone
[24.12.21 10:41:36] mitzi: I got you, look
[24.12.21 10:42:52] mitzi: when I deploy from a VM clone
I immediately change the hostname, delete the network interface and reinstall to a new one
but it's so in vmvar and proxmox, in vmbox you should probably do the same
[24.12.21 10:44:02] mitzi: if you kill the netmap completely and install netmap #2, the settings are not saved from the old
[24.12.21 10:44:35] angelo: So I actually have to select Strip all network adapter mac adress
[24.12.21 10:44:42] angelo: so the machine is not a clone yes ?
[24.12.21 10:45:44] mitzi: Yes need to reconfigure the adapter settings
Strip all network adapter Mac adress
you can also do it manually
[24.12.21 10:46:03] angelo: Yeah, got it.

[24.12.21 10:46:11] angelo: so not even nat save ?
[24.12.21 10:47:07] mitzi: and why, nat rules by default settings will pull up himself, and a new ip from his table will give
[24.12.21 10:47:36] angelo: got it, thanks! Good for asking!
[24.12.21 10:47:46] mitzi: +

[24.12.21 10:52:14] angelo: ouch!
[24.12.21 10:52:35] angelo: is there a difference in .ova or put in iso image ?
[24.12.21 10:53:14] mitzi: ova is an open format, I save it during migration, for example, no problems
[24.12.21 10:53:25] angelo: got it
[24.12.21 10:53:27] angelo: so I will
[24.12.21 10:54:03] mitzi: ova is eating all hypervisors for sure, better in it
