[21.09.21 15:05:24] elijah: Hi!
[21.09.21 15:06:08] elijah: collin said, can I ask you to run the binary on antivirus virtual machines? Can you help?
[21.09.21 15:07:59] angelo: hi !
[21.09.21 15:08:05] angelo: bro, do you have 15 minutes ?
[21.09.21 15:08:15] angelo: just got up from the table
[21.09.21 15:08:21] angelo: 20 at the most
[21.09.21 15:08:26] angelo: step back
[21.09.21 15:08:28] angelo: okay ?
[21.09.21 15:09:35] elijah: Of course) If you can help with that, tell me when you have time

[21.09.21 16:19:45] angelo: where do you want it?
[21.09.21 16:19:47] angelo: on 10 ?
[21.09.21 16:19:51] angelo: 64 normal ?
[21.09.21 16:20:56] elijah: yeah 10, x64
[21.09.21 16:21:12] elijah: seems like last week my loader when running on simantec and trend micro give a detection. Some on statics, some on dynamics
[21.09.21 16:21:54] elijah: I corrected the loader. I would like to run some binary on these two AVs in static and dynamic
[21.09.21 16:22:21] elijah: I'll send you binary files - there will be one *.exe and two *.dlls
[21.09.21 16:22:33] angelo: on the farm
[21.09.21 16:22:40] angelo: :face_vomiting:
[21.09.21 16:22:42] elijah: apparently yes
[21.09.21 16:22:43] angelo: )))
[21.09.21 16:23:49] elijah: farm, is it booooooo?)
[21.09.21 16:24:16] angelo: yeah ((!
[21.09.21 16:24:22] angelo: lag terrible
[21.09.21 16:26:29] elijah: `Lj7562sd3$&Bdd2#&ghfjvp[asFJfaI843rFDFjsdufg

[21.09.21 16:28:15] angelo: now
[21.09.21 16:28:22] angelo: making coffee
[21.09.21 16:28:38] elijah: thank you.)
[21.09.21 16:28:39] angelo: on two farms
[21.09.21 16:28:44] angelo: yes ?
[21.09.21 16:29:11] elijah: yes, each binary on simantec and trend micro in static and dynamic. Will there be detects.
[21.09.21 16:35:47] angelo: yes
[21.09.21 16:35:52] angelo: sorry.
[21.09.21 16:36:00] angelo: statics and dynamics
[21.09.21 16:36:23] angelo: wait, damn it!
[21.09.21 16:36:30] angelo: and on the dinchik ?!?!?
[21.09.21 16:36:32] angelo: check
[21.09.21 16:37:51] angelo: or do you have to run on the machine ?
[21.09.21 16:38:04] angelo: I'm so stupid today
[21.09.21 16:38:29] elijah: neither simantec nor trend micro
[21.09.21 16:38:58] elijah: I've checked simantec and statics and trend, but I need to check if our AV farm also has no detects
[21.09.21 16:39:19] elijah: in principle, just check dynamics
[21.09.21 16:40:01] elijah: you absolutely need to run the execution, so that dynamic detects would pop up, if they are there
[21.09.21 16:42:05] angelo: ok bro
[21.09.21 16:42:07] angelo: it'll happen
[21.09.21 16:42:13] angelo: I hate our farms.)
[21.09.21 16:42:19] angelo: I once sat with them for 8 hours
[21.09.21 16:44:25] elijah: thanks to you, bro))

[21.09.21 16:58:14] angelo: plus there are problems
[21.09.21 16:58:25] angelo: like right now, Trend Micro doesn't want to update bases
[21.09.21 16:58:46] angelo: long, I was chasing one ddla through all about 8 hours]
[21.09.21 17:01:13] elijah: aww..... I'll wait)
[21.09.21 17:01:33] angelo: i can check without update, but is it necessary ?
[21.09.21 17:03:27] angelo: one update sometimes cost 40 minutes
[21.09.21 17:03:30] elijah: Better with update. I'll wait, there is time)
[21.09.21 17:03:45] angelo: wait with update, I'm checking with admin now)
[21.09.21 17:03:50] angelo: does not want to update
[21.09.21 17:04:00] elijah: And how do testers run the builds? They will wait for the result.
[21.09.21 17:04:17] angelo: ask for something easier
[21.09.21 17:04:22] elijah: ))))
[21.09.21 17:04:24] angelo: static
[21.09.21 17:04:30] angelo: sometimes on farms
[21.09.21 17:04:42] angelo: sometimes
[21.09.21 17:04:53] angelo: I don't believe they were raced often
[21.09.21 17:05:07] angelo: well, here, bam, and admin went offline )))
[21.09.21 17:05:16] elijah: ))))
[21.09.21 17:05:31] elijah: off until tomorrow)
[21.09.21 17:05:34] angelo: so I will try to check it on simantics if I get it to update patrons
[21.09.21 17:05:36] angelo: hz)
[21.09.21 17:06:03] angelo: but there is such a thing, you give a problem and the man was probably like, "eppttii me for a couple of hours, fuck it, i'll be off
[21.09.21 17:06:03] angelo: =)
[21.09.21 17:06:20] elijah: ahahhhhhh)))
