[26.07.21 14:19:10] hammer: Hi.
[26.07.21 14:19:25] hammer: did you and jime test the map collection?
[26.07.21 14:20:18] hammer: The client asks about the section in the admin
Card List

He wants to collect card data there, I see that we have now implemented a search by logpost through the regulars of this data.
But now the data is not collected, but there are 4 maps for July 8 or so. (That is to say this functionality works at all)
Question, what can it be related to and who does the module that sends the data on the forms
formgrabber
[26.07.21 14:20:30] hammer: found out.
[26.07.21 14:42:25] angelo: hi
[26.07.21 14:42:53] angelo: formrabber didn't even touch it
[26.07.21 14:43:43] hammer: okay.
[28.07.21 14:08:06] angelo: hi.
[28.07.21 14:08:11] angelo: you stopped writing that
[28.07.21 14:18:06] hammer: Hi.
[28.07.21 14:18:09] hammer: I didn't write today
[28.07.21 14:20:46] angelo: that's why I asked, I seemed to write every day and stopped
[28.07.21 14:24:20] hammer: okay, tell me about your progress, how's the inject?
[28.07.21 14:24:36] hammer: there's robin complaining about bots going into hanypot
[28.07.21 14:24:48] hammer: he needs all modules to be detected
[28.07.21 14:24:55] hammer: check it carefully
[28.07.21 14:24:58] angelo: that's bullshit
[28.07.21 14:25:26] angelo: well, i'll watch from roibon superbrowser
[28.07.21 14:25:30] angelo: that's not right
[28.07.21 14:25:38] hammer: did it give you anything?
[28.07.21 14:25:45] angelo: now Dillon has a problem with the injector.)
[28.07.21 14:25:53] angelo: gave out what?)
[28.07.21 14:25:56] hammer: no injection?
[28.07.21 14:26:00] hammer: superbrowser
[28.07.21 14:26:41] hammer: maybe another problem with config on the injector?
[28.07.21 14:27:08] angelo: i still don't get it
[28.07.21 14:27:12] angelo: I'll get it online
[28.07.21 14:27:19] angelo: I'm not familiar with SB
[28.07.21 14:27:25] angelo: yesterday was the first time
[28.07.21 14:27:38] angelo: how do you understand bots go into haniki - I don't understand it
[28.07.21 14:50:53] hammer: hanypots, they are like traps for bot, instead of real machines, it infects all sorts of shit, where the bot doesn't work
[28.07.21 14:51:40] hammer: write me back about the injector as soon as you know
[28.07.21 14:53:44] hammer: he needs to activate in Adam, otherwise he won't start his browser
[28.07.21 14:55:29] angelo: yes, he already did it last night
[28.07.21 15:27:04] hammer: did you run it yourself?
[29.07.21 09:21:04] angelo: hi
[29.07.21 09:21:06] angelo: I need you.
[29.07.21 09:21:25] angelo: tell me how superbrowser should work ideally
[29.07.21 09:25:20] hammer: Ghbdtn? gjujlb ytvyjuj
[29.07.21 09:25:27] hammer: Hey, wait a minute.
[29.07.21 09:27:00] hammer: Is there a problem?
[29.07.21 09:28:54] angelo: We always have problems
[29.07.21 09:29:03] angelo: The client said it's not working
[29.07.21 09:29:15] angelo: but no one told me how it should work
[29.07.21 09:29:19] hammer: that's why we're building a new one
[29.07.21 09:29:24] angelo: what's the result
[29.07.21 09:29:34] hammer: but he recently wrote that everything was fine
[29.07.21 09:29:42] angelo: dunno
[29.07.21 09:29:51] angelo: Robin said 2 weeks nothing
[29.07.21 09:30:03] angelo: why did they give me the job?
[29.07.21 09:30:08] angelo: bored or something
[29.07.21 09:30:11] hammer: two weeks no configs from import?
[29.07.21 09:30:15] hammer: who gave?
[29.07.21 09:30:34] angelo: Def
[29.07.21 09:30:41] angelo: Franz wrote
[29.07.21 09:30:59] angelo: about the importation, I won't tell
[29.07.21 09:31:33] hammer: okay, I'll finish the urgent ones and report back
[29.07.21 09:40:34] hammer: no detects by inject?
[29.07.21 09:41:40] angelo: I don't think so
[29.07.21 09:42:08] angelo: we have two problems now, we have three
[29.07.21 09:42:35] hammer: what are they?
[29.07.21 09:42:39] hammer: besides sb
[29.07.21 09:43:29] angelo: Dillon's Inject doesn't work
[29.07.21 09:43:37] angelo: Zeus' bots are dying
[29.07.21 09:43:53] hammer: bot crashes, not our fault
[29.07.21 09:44:16] hammer: is the Dylon Injection related to the config?
[29.07.21 09:45:08] angelo: yes
[29.07.21 09:45:16] angelo: but it's not clear what's wrong
[29.07.21 09:45:36] hammer: hmm, okay, I'll let you know what's going on
[29.07.21 09:46:24] angelo: me and heimi are on the phone
[29.07.21 09:53:10] hammer: Okay, I'm here.
[29.07.21 09:54:42] hammer: the job of the cb is to take the configs you imported and convert them into profiles and launch a browser that will let you access the same pages you used to go to on the imported machine
[29.07.21 09:55:19] hammer: if the client was on e.g. Walmart, on Sat you could also access it with its cookies, with its socket, if it's received
[29.07.21 09:55:58] hammer: that means technically you'll be the same person and you won't log in from the Hub, but from the original machine
[29.07.21 09:56:19] hammer: there must be a password saved in idevle, so you wouldn't be bothered by the protections
[29.07.21 09:56:38] hammer: but if not saved, you can get it from the vault and use it to log in
[29.07.21 09:56:54] hammer: did you get the vault and sb?
[29.07.21 10:02:05] hammer: try to find out about the instructions for it, I do not have them for a long time, but maybe saved by someone
[29.07.21 10:14:15] angelo: ok
[29.07.21 10:14:23] angelo: I think he pulled it up
[29.07.21 10:14:28] angelo: here's his password and logs
[29.07.21 10:14:30] angelo: how to view
[29.07.21 10:14:33] angelo: take it from there
[29.07.21 10:14:40] hammer: now
[29.07.21 10:14:49] hammer: I'll send you the manual
[29.07.21 10:15:02] angelo: I have a manual
[29.07.21 10:15:33] angelo: you can't understand your passwords and logs
[29.07.21 10:21:13] hammer: the machine is crashing and it all gets transferred to sb
[29.07.21 10:21:26] hammer: as if you logged in from the original, not the original
[29.07.21 10:21:35] hammer: vault passwords
[29.07.21 10:21:49] hammer: you use such a pink admin panel?
[29.07.21 10:22:58] angelo: yes
[29.07.21 10:23:00] angelo: pink
[29.07.21 10:23:24] angelo: storage is pink admin
[29.07.21 10:23:29] angelo: where to get them there
[29.07.21 10:24:04] hammer: i can't tell you that, i can't access it
[29.07.21 10:24:30] hammer: there should be either bookmarks separately, or at the bottom a field with lots of links
[29.07.21 10:24:31] angelo: but it should not automatically substitute ?
[29.07.21 10:24:48] hammer: well, not always, as I remember
[29.07.21 10:25:14] hammer: the password fields are empty, it's normal
[29.07.21 10:25:35] hammer: check with adam, because I can't see it
[29.07.21 10:25:42] angelo: ok
[29.07.21 10:25:48] hammer: where are the passwords in it
[29.07.21 10:25:52] angelo: this is the job
[29.07.21 10:25:59] angelo: I know by passwords
[29.07.21 10:26:13] hammer: The software is designed to imitate work in a browser, using someone else's fingerprints.
To do this:
- Grabber module collects browser profiles (cookies, locale, timezone, etc.)
- The superbrowser allows to use those fingerprints to work as this user.
[29.07.21 10:26:28] hammer: here's the main thing
[29.07.21 10:26:36] angelo: I got it
[29.07.21 10:26:45] angelo: but the data is a bit unclear
[29.07.21 10:26:54] hammer: you can also use your id to save the sock module, to get it from the right machine, and then paste it into the Launcher
[29.07.21 10:28:04] angelo: and what gives a nipple module ?
[29.07.21 10:28:06] angelo: socks
[29.07.21 10:28:08] angelo: I don't get it
[29.07.21 10:28:27] hammer: same sock as the robbed car
[29.07.21 10:28:58] hammer: you can put it into a separate window
[29.07.21 10:29:08] hammer: that's to match the original even more
[29.07.21 10:29:37] angelo: that means if for dumbasses he copies ip ?
[29.07.21 10:33:38] hammer: yeah
[29.07.21 10:35:22] hammer: the problem is that it doesn't start or there are no configs for it, it doesn't build
[29.07.21 10:35:49] hammer: brooks is working on it
[29.07.21 10:44:45] angelo: I don't get it right
[29.07.21 10:44:51] angelo: texted Robin
[29.07.21 10:46:13] angelo: said he had a problem with cookies
[29.07.21 10:46:28] angelo: what he meant by that and how exactly the error is manifested I don't got it
[29.07.21 11:37:44] angelo: (4:34:39 AM) ugly@1jabber.com: cookies don't work themselves
(4:34:41 AM) ugly@1jabber.com: okay
(4:34:49 AM) ugly@1jabber.com: I see that the Holder lets in google soap
(4:34:50 AM) ugly@1jabber.com: yahoo soap
(4:34:52 AM) ugly@1jabber.com: to bank aces
(4:35:07 AM) ugly@1jabber.com: open google soap in browser with his cookies, he doesn't even know the login, same for yahoo
(4:35:09 AM) ugly@1jabber.com: all sites like this
[29.07.21 11:38:41] hammer: what if I take the logins from the repository?
[29.07.21 11:39:06] angelo: that's how
[29.07.21 11:39:56] hammer: adam didn't answer?
[29.07.21 11:40:08] angelo: well, what do you think?)
[29.07.21 11:40:25] hammer: i don't think so
[29.07.21 11:40:38] angelo: yeah
[29.07.21 11:40:49] angelo: (4:40:05 AM) ugly@1jabber.com: that's where I'm coming from
(4:40:07 AM) ugly@1jabber.com: configs
[29.07.21 11:40:50] hammer: now
[29.07.21 11:40:53] angelo: about the storage
[29.07.21 11:41:00] hammer: not only configs can be taken there
[29.07.21 11:41:02] angelo: I don't understand what's going on
[29.07.21 11:41:04] hammer: wait a minute
[29.07.21 11:41:08] angelo: okay
[29.07.21 11:41:19] hammer: how about me, if I can't even see the vault?)
[29.07.21 11:41:44] hammer: I asked adam for access, apparently, I can't, testers have to do it themselves
[29.07.21 11:42:24] hammer: contact Eugene, ask him, he'll answer faster
[29.07.21 11:42:29] hammer: he's been working with sb
[29.07.21 11:42:41] hammer: eugene
[29.07.21 11:42:58] hammer: okay, stop, he has no access
[29.07.21 11:43:09] angelo: just don't understand if def didn't give him the job
[29.07.21 11:43:25] angelo: I actually saw this browser a couple of times ((
[29.07.21 11:43:33] angelo: like a blind man trying to understand
[29.07.21 11:43:34] hammer: it's the same
[29.07.21 11:49:19] angelo: that doesn't make me feel any better, there are clients' problems and I AM HEAVILY involved in their problems
[29.07.21 11:49:20] angelo: that is, I care
[29.07.21 11:49:32] angelo: I feel their pain through the screen
[29.07.21 11:51:33] hammer: man
[29.07.21 11:51:50] hammer: the office won't forget you
[29.07.21 11:52:04] angelo: you know, i'm getting really fucked up
[29.07.21 11:52:13] angelo: this is some kind of rat race
[29.07.21 11:52:21] hammer: i believe i've been in your shoes
[29.07.21 11:52:38] angelo: and the big picture kills
[29.07.21 11:52:48] angelo: it shouldn't be like this
[29.07.21 11:53:02] angelo: we're not trading stuff through Ozone
[29.07.21 11:53:39] hammer: and for nothing)
[29.07.21 11:53:49] angelo: )))
[29.07.21 11:54:52] hammer: frank will write where to get what
[29.07.21 11:55:03] angelo: yeah
[29.07.21 11:55:07] angelo: he already did
[29.07.21 11:55:25] angelo: and you know, about the office do not forget, rose-colored glasses I took off ))
[29.07.21 11:55:42] hammer: i went to sylver, he is also powerless in terms of storage, also without access
[29.07.21 12:12:59] angelo: no
[29.07.21 12:13:01] angelo: the problem is different
[29.07.21 12:13:07] angelo: I'll give him access, he'll show you
[29.07.21 12:13:13] angelo: what are we talking about?
[29.07.21 12:13:19] hammer: Take screenshots
[29.07.21 12:13:57] angelo: how to take screenshots in batches?
[29.07.21 12:14:00] angelo: not just one
[29.07.21 12:14:33] hammer: I don't know, one at a time
[29.07.21 12:14:40] angelo: ok
[29.07.21 12:15:09] hammer: you can open Paint and paste and save
[29.07.21 12:15:29] hammer: take a screenshot, paste, save, take a screenshot, paste, save
[29.07.21 12:25:54] angelo: 1 configs are not loaded
[29.07.21 12:36:01] angelo: what is the answer for config loading?
[29.07.21 12:41:15] hammer: not uploaded where?
[29.07.21 12:42:13] hammer: did you skim?
[29.07.21 12:45:29] angelo: there's no need to take a screenshot
[29.07.21 12:46:40] hammer: you got no configs in storage?
[29.07.21 12:46:48] angelo: not all
[29.07.21 12:46:52] angelo: not from all browsers
[29.07.21 12:47:03] angelo: and the main problem is SB doesn't load cookies or something
[29.07.21 12:47:13] angelo: so it doesn't recognize the user
[29.07.21 12:47:18] hammer: hmm
[29.07.21 12:47:36] angelo: we don't support SB anymore
[29.07.21 12:47:40] angelo: and its developer left
[29.07.21 12:47:43] angelo: cool
[29.07.21 12:47:57] hammer: we're redoing it now
[29.07.21 12:48:18] hammer: the one you're watching with Robin, he's old
[29.07.21 12:48:28] hammer: Weldon is working on a new one
[29.07.21 12:48:55] hammer: he got the sources, he's trying to figure it out
[29.07.21 12:49:56] angelo: the client thinks there's a problem with the robber
[29.07.21 12:50:13] hammer: let's double-check
[29.07.21 12:50:59] angelo: what module is this grabber ?!
[29.07.21 12:52:19] angelo: import ?
[29.07.21 13:20:33] hammer: yes
[29.07.21 13:41:18] angelo: and brooks pem off
[29.07.21 13:47:15] hammer: nothing new with brooks yet, i found out
[29.07.21 13:47:33] hammer: he'll let me know when he's done
[29.07.21 13:47:49] angelo: Why 2 weeks ago SB was working and now he is not
[29.07.21 13:47:53] angelo: that's where to find out what's wrong
[29.07.21 14:42:02] hammer: Come on.
[29.07.21 14:42:15] hammer: tomorrow brooks will look at the code
[29.07.21 15:01:55] angelo: it's a long time
[29.07.21 15:02:08] angelo: everybody's taking too long
[30.07.21 10:01:36] angelo: hello
[30.07.21 10:01:41] angelo: and who tests the import ?
[30.07.21 10:05:21] hammer: hi, eugene, as far as I know
[30.07.21 10:05:30] hammer: did you upload any changes ?
[30.07.21 10:05:53] angelo: brooks will tell you
[02.08.21 09:44:55] hammer: Hey, how's it going?
[02.08.21 09:45:09] angelo: hi
[02.08.21 09:45:15] angelo: progress not yet clear
[02.08.21 09:45:24] angelo: I'm having a hard time with import
[02.08.21 09:45:32] angelo: I got a message
[02.08.21 09:45:55] angelo: he really needs SuperBrowser
[02.08.21 09:46:25] hammer: he won't have it before he does
[02.08.21 09:46:42] hammer: everybody's waiting
[02.08.21 09:46:42] angelo: well said!)
[02.08.21 09:47:16] angelo: you should answer his wife when I come home - I will not come before 5 AM, I will not come before
[02.08.21 09:47:17] angelo: )
[02.08.21 09:47:42] hammer: yes)
[02.08.21 09:48:09] angelo: did brooks say anything ?
[02.08.21 09:48:16] angelo: import is very important for all
[02.08.21 09:48:39] hammer: brooks dump assemblies, I'm running directly through grabber exechunk, there's still a problem
[02.08.21 09:48:47] hammer: both caesar and brux know
[02.08.21 09:49:25] angelo: at least he makes new builds
[02.08.21 09:49:29] angelo: that's good
[02.08.21 09:49:47] angelo: it's not his design
[02.08.21 09:49:58] angelo: redoing and modifying someone else's code is always a problem
[02.08.21 09:50:03] hammer: there with varying success, one fixes the other fails
[02.08.21 09:50:34] hammer: when it's done, you'll upload it to the module and check how it works
[02.08.21 09:50:35] angelo: I understand, that's how it works for us
[02.08.21 09:50:41] hammer: did you figure out the sub?
[02.08.21 09:56:38] angelo: unfortunately cookie robbery sucks
[02.08.21 09:56:47] angelo: what kind of module is robbing ?
[02.08.21 09:56:51] angelo: )
[02.08.21 09:58:25] angelo: import, right?
[02.08.21 10:01:38] hammer: yeah
[02.08.21 10:01:54] angelo: well)
[02.08.21 10:02:09] angelo: there are two problems - cookies are not robbed and configs not always
[02.08.21 10:02:13] angelo: zero effect
[05.08.21 09:57:21] angelo: hi!
[05.08.21 09:57:24] angelo: report in progress
[05.08.21 09:57:27] angelo: coming soon
[05.08.21 09:57:48] angelo: as soon as possible
[05.08.21 09:58:27] hammer: ok
[05.08.21 11:59:45] angelo: here's the Inject
[05.08.21 11:59:49] angelo: don't know what else to say
[05 08.08.21 11:59:49] angelo: I was testing a new build of the module and working out the reworked Dylon config.
The new build of Inject was tested with the current Defender update.
No detects were found.
New injecta release does code insertion (not working before).
[05.08.21 12:00:02] angelo: I don't know yet, we have to work out Edge, it's not working
[05.08.21 12:00:57] angelo: Write about Superbrowser mini-test and yesterday VNC ?
[05.08.21 12:01:40] hammer: yes
[05.08.21 12:01:41] hammer: Write everything
[05.08.21 12:11:22] angelo: InjectDLL
Tested a new build of the module and debugging of reworked Dylon config on MOD8 bots.
New Inject build was tested on actual Defender update.
No detects were found.
New Inject release does code insertion (not working before).

SuperBrowser
Tested SB on client bot via TW.
1. Configurations were loaded through the panel partially. That is, somewhere robbed, somewhere not.
2. When accessing the same BoF using a log/pair, the user was not recognized and was not allowed to log in.
As we have already figured out the gaps in the Import module.

VNZ
Started looking at the GNC module on the tst61/mod8 group bot workout.
1. At intervals of 5-10 minutes there was a break in communication.
2. Browser overloads as noted earlier by the client was not spotted (here already need to look at different versions of browsers).
Observed partial failure to go to the links, when you open a new tab Chrome/Edge, the problem disappeared.
We continue to keep watch.
[05.08.21 12:11:26] angelo: +-
[05.08.21 14:02:45] hammer: and how do you watch vntz module. if old one doesn't work and new grem didn't give?
[05.08.21 14:03:11] angelo: how do you understand the old one does not work ?
[05.08.21 14:03:25] angelo: I'm uploading via VNC bot
[05.08.21 14:03:32] angelo: and the viewer gave me lon
[05.08.21 14:03:38] hammer: well, as far as i know, the old vnts module is crooked, they didn't put it on start
[05.08.21 14:03:46] hammer: hmm, okay
[05.08.21 14:03:54] angelo: well, i was given the task
[05.08.21 14:04:00] angelo: and me and the coder are watching
[05.08.21 14:04:15] angelo: everything just got really weird and old ((
[05.08.21 14:04:34] hammer: it's just a mess. a lot of stuff all at once
[05.08.21 14:25:58] angelo: i'm running vntz now
[05.08.21 15:06:45] hammer: how is it?
[05.08.21 15:07:05] hammer: does the right mouse button bring up a window with possible actions?
[05.08.21 15:07:23] angelo: sure
[05.08.21 15:07:34] angelo: chrome works
[05.08.21 15:07:37] angelo: but it's broken
[05.08.21 15:07:41] hammer: and everything works?
[05.08.21 15:07:45] hammer: Ah, the usual.)
[05.08.21 15:07:56] angelo: everything seems to be working
[05.08.21 15:08:00] angelo: I used to have a bad connection
[05.08.21 15:08:02] angelo: now normal
[05.08.21 15:08:09] hammer: Tell me the module name
[05.08.21 15:08:13] angelo: now
[05.08.21 15:08:17] hammer: vncDll?
[05.08.21 15:08:21] angelo: yes
[09.08.21 12:15:05] angelo: hi
[09.08.21 12:15:06] angelo: how was the import ?!
[09.08.21 12:26:18] hammer: Hi, in progress
[09.08.21 12:26:28] hammer: can't wait to feel ?
[09.08.21 12:26:54] angelo: can't wait for the guys to start working]
[09.08.21 12:26:58] angelo: gotta feel ?
[09.08.21 12:27:01] angelo: feel
[09.08.21 12:27:11] angelo: no problem
[09.08.21 12:27:19] hammer: everything will be, assembly is cleared of all problems
[09.08.21 12:27:33] angelo: shit, I gotta fix the trick
[09.08.21 12:27:38] angelo: caesar says to clean it
[09.08.21 12:28:14] hammer: yes, there were detects
[09.08.21 12:28:38] angelo: well yeah, the client was just saying
[09.08.21 12:28:48] angelo: he's telling me everything that's not working ))
[09.08.21 12:29:00] hammer: you tell me too
[09.08.21 12:29:18] angelo: ok
[09.08.21 12:29:27] angelo: i'm a very empathetic guy
[09.08.21 12:30:38] hammer: muzhaisa, there are not many places where you can find so many nerves, tears, tragedies and emotions as here
[11.08.21 09:52:26] hammer: Hi, the import assembly is uploaded, you can watch
[11.08.21 09:55:13] hammer: if you build on the test, do it with closed browsers
tested on the latest build of the windup with the latest updates of the axis and browsers
[11.08.21 10:11:45] angelo: hi
[11.08.21 10:11:55] angelo: I'll make a new axis
[11.08.21 10:12:02] angelo: I'm getting a little dirty
[11.08.21 10:12:05] angelo: okay?
[11.08.21 10:17:35] hammer: yeah, I just wanted to know what kind of test
[11.08.21 10:17:42] hammer: build 21H1
[11.08.21 10:17:48] angelo: ok
[11.08.21 10:17:57] angelo: I'm upgrading to maxima
[11.08.21 10:18:09] hammer: it's because different builds can have different browser processes names
[11.08.21 10:18:36] angelo: when I start, I'll torture you with questions
[11.08.21 10:18:56] hammer: and in general, Silver suggested to support the last two versions of browsers, because they can be like dogs, you can not keep track of them all
[11.08.21 10:19:19] hammer: I tested the fact of collecting imported stuff
[11.08.21 10:19:20] angelo: Yeah.
[11.08.21 10:19:21] angelo: read
[11.08.21 10:19:25] angelo: and that's right
[11.08.21 10:19:34] angelo: most update browsers
[11.08.21 10:19:40] hammer: now you need to see what he collects, I won't check that, the content itself
[11.08.21 10:20:13] hammer: told Eugene to check it too
[11.08.21 10:20:21] hammer: eugene
[11.08.21 11:42:00] angelo: okay
[11.08.21 11:42:04] angelo: haven't touched it in years
[11.08.21 11:43:22] angelo: what bot do you check?
[11.08.21 11:45:02] angelo: I'm going to clean up a little and I will have to leave, two days trying to finish my work in the morning, but my customers put tests xls in the morning
[11.08.21 12:11:32] hammer: start any bot, then start importing
[11.08.21 12:11:51] hammer: received configurations in the antic
[11.08.21 12:12:17] angelo: yeah
[11.08.21 12:12:20] angelo: got it
[11.08.21 12:12:32] angelo: sometimes I ask too much
[11.08.21 12:12:38] angelo: I can't get out of that habit
[11.08.21 12:12:48] hammer: now for your full joy wait for new antique
[11.08.21 12:13:03] angelo: antique
[11.08.21 12:13:06] hammer: that's good, better to specify
[11.08.21 12:13:06] angelo: what is it ?
[11.08.21 12:13:09] hammer: sb
[11.08.21 12:13:16] angelo: ah
[11.08.21 12:13:23] hammer: superbrowser
[11.08.21 12:13:51] angelo: got it, definitely not the security service, though SB is always associated with it
[11.08.21 12:13:55] angelo: )
[11.08.21 12:14:55] hammer: )
[11.08.21 12:49:07] angelo: and you know what's weird, I don't have 21
[11.08.21 12:49:08] angelo: version 20
[11.08.21 13:35:50] hammer: i had it too. last update didn't give me the latest build, i downloaded and rolled it myself
[11.08.21 13:36:21] hammer: i don't know why it wouldn't update itself
[11.08.21 13:36:32] angelo: I thought silver said that updates are not static
[11.08.21 13:36:44] angelo: what affects ip and what the hell else
[11.08.21 13:36:55] angelo: the same detect is floating
[11.08.21 13:37:01] angelo: sometimes
[11.08.21 13:37:05] hammer: quite
[11.08.21 13:39:34] hammer: don't forget about the report
[11.08.21 13:39:47] angelo: shit!
[11.08.21 13:39:49] angelo: Wednesday already ?!?
[11.08.21 13:39:52] angelo: i thought tuesday
[11.08.21 13:40:02] angelo: Shit.
[11.08.21 13:40:21] angelo: Days flew by like one!
[11.08.21 13:40:28] angelo: Honestly.
[11.08.21 13:54:59] hammer: +
[11.08.21 14:10:36] angelo: just so you understand, if I'm chatting in the chat room, it doesn't mean I'm sitting here drinking coffee
[11.08.21 14:10:46] angelo: let me ask frank how to download the logs
[11.08.21 15:08:29] angelo: I'll finish the xls
[11.08.21 15:08:31] angelo: and look at the logs
[11.08.21 15:08:39] angelo: I have the logs
[11.08.21 15:08:48] angelo: did it with the test bot
[12.08.21 10:38:34] angelo: hello! I'm restarting import again
[12.08.21 10:38:48] angelo: and i'll write a report bro
[12.08.21 10:38:51] angelo: don't make a fuss!
[12.08.21 10:41:38] hammer: Hey, okay.
[12.08.21 10:48:09] angelo: sorry for procrastination, but honestly, I'm not procrastinating, the report is so brain-eating, yesterday I had a lot of trouble with the xls
[12.08.21 10:48:31] angelo: I'll try, bro.
[12.08.21 11:01:54] hammer: it's okay, as long as he doesn't swear
[12.08.21 11:06:52] hammer: they say they launched vntz module today, did you watch it?
[12.08.21 11:06:58] hammer: new
[12.08.21 11:08:22] angelo: launched yesterday
[12.08.21 11:08:31] angelo: but it didn't work
[12.08.21 11:08:42] angelo: adam said he had to do something
[12.08.21 11:08:42] angelo: with him
[12.08.21 12:06:15] angelo: something's wrong with the configs
[12.08.21 12:06:18] angelo: the import
[12.08.21 12:06:26] angelo: now caesar will look at the debug
[12.08.21 12:12:12] hammer: that's not it
[12.08.21 12:15:19] hammer: isn't it working or what?
[12.08.21 12:15:35] angelo: it's not clear
[12.08.21 12:15:36] angelo: tried to download
[12.08.21 12:15:38] angelo: doesn't give
[12.08.21 12:15:44] angelo: there is a debugger
[12.08.21 12:15:49] angelo: but I honestly have no idea
[12.08.21 12:15:57] angelo: waiting for an answer
[12.08.21 12:16:13] angelo: no funk, caesar's not talking yet
[12.08.21 12:16:50] hammer: yes, i need frank too
[12.08.21 13:05:27] angelo: ImportDll

VNC(first)
Tested the first VNC module with the encoder through the fork.
The bugs of the connection falling off were noted.



Inject
Inject was tested on a bot with a new config from the developer.
It was run on Windows 10 64 on a crypto-trick on test group 31.
There were no detects on config processing.
No changes were made to the mudul.
[12.08.21 13:05:36] angelo: mush in my head again (
[12.08.21 13:12:50] hammer: FF Version 91.0 64
When I open the browser opens a tab with the address: http://127.0.0.1:58163/25027 well this is normal
[12.08.21 13:13:16] angelo: what is it anyway ?
[12.08.21 13:13:26] angelo: and how do you mean normally? is it a bug that you've put up with ?
[12.08.21 13:13:48] angelo: Frank came
[12.08.21 13:13:50] hammer: well, it's still unknown how to remove
[12.08.21 13:13:57] angelo: yeah
[12.08.21 13:14:04] hammer: but there were no browser openings during looting?
[12.08.21 13:14:06] angelo: it's a hidden tab
[12.08.21 13:14:11] angelo: no
[12.08.21 13:14:13] angelo: it wasn't
[12.08.21 13:14:19] angelo: it wasn't on import
[12.08.21 13:14:30] angelo: there was a tab I described, chroma
[12.08.21 13:14:44] angelo: and there was a broken tab, but it's doing the Inject module
[12.08.21 13:14:54] hammer: no more bruzers should not start by themselves, you can see it only in the Process Manager
[12.08.21 13:15:44] hammer: but it's ok if after starting your browsers tell you they were closed unexpectedly
[12.08.21 13:16:24] angelo: forgot to add that the launch was with closed browsers
[12.08.21 13:16:41] hammer: Yeah, right.
[12.08.21 13:16:47] hammer: and the module was started by user?
[12.08.21 13:16:57] angelo: yes
[12.08.21 13:17:06] angelo: always seems to be started by the user
[12.08.21 13:17:12] angelo: let's do it from the admin
[12.08.21 13:17:23] hammer: well, admins start throwing pranks of varying severity
[12.08.21 13:17:27] hammer: no, no need
[12.08.21 13:17:28] angelo: now
[12.08.21 13:17:31] angelo: okay.
[12.08.21 13:17:36] angelo: better figure out what's with the cookies
[12.08.21 13:17:43] angelo: can you read the debugger?
[12.08.21 13:17:44] hammer: caesar didn't answer you yet?
[12.08.21 13:17:46] angelo: I can send it to you
[12.08.21 13:17:49] angelo: no
[12.08.21 13:17:53] hammer: send it to brooks
[12.08.21 13:18:45] angelo: right !
[12.08.21 13:18:51] angelo: unsubscribe
[12.08.21 13:39:50] angelo: config is transferred
[12.08.21 13:39:55] angelo: now thinking how to download ))
[12.08.21 13:48:00] angelo: got it
[12.08.21 13:48:02] angelo: I'll let you know
[12.08.21 13:48:07] angelo: no chrome
[12.08.21 13:57:22] angelo: I'll fix it, something is wrong with Chrome, maybe it was running
[12.08.21 13:57:22] hammer: what chrome version?
[12.08.21 13:57:29] angelo: last version exactly
[12.08.21 13:57:33] angelo: give me time
[12.08.21 14:06:03] angelo: f rerb
[12.08.21 14:06:06] angelo: and cookies
[12.08.21 14:06:11] angelo: they go in configs ?
[12.08.21 14:10:03] hammer: they should, as far as I know
[12.08.21 14:13:36] hammer: no cookies?
[12.08.21 14:15:16] angelo: maybe there is
[12.08.21 14:25:53] angelo: everything seems to be there
[12.08.21 14:25:58] angelo: I see the history.
[12.08.21 14:27:10] hammer: that's fine, it's looting fine
[12.08.21 14:27:28] angelo: but you have to check with superbrowser
[12.08.21 14:27:35] angelo: it's cookie sensitive
[12.08.21 14:27:38] hammer: yeah.
[12.08.21 14:27:57] angelo: config/istrix
[12.08.21 14:28:03] angelo: looking for logins
[12.08.21 14:28:05] angelo: and pairs
[12.08.21 14:28:44] angelo: but it's better to look in pink yes ?
[12.08.21 14:28:50] hammer: yeah
[12.08.21 15:46:23] angelo: for some reason the bot didn't get into the pink admin - frank is on it
[12.08.21 15:46:30] angelo: to look through logs there
[12.08.21 15:48:54] hammer: the gasket must be dead
[12.08.21 15:49:06] angelo: what ?
[12.08.21 15:49:09] angelo: exactly
[12.08.21 15:49:24] angelo: between admin and bot ?
[12.08.21 15:49:37] hammer: the hell knows, maybe an admin, maybe a module
[12.08.21 15:49:46] angelo: anyway, there are konigs
[12.08.21 15:49:48] angelo: there are cookies
[12.08.21 15:49:57] hammer: now you have to read them
[12.08.21 15:49:58] angelo: check the pink one as well
[12.08.21 15:50:15] hammer: there's some crap there, maybe unreadable
[12.08.21 15:50:29] angelo: well, you can see your browsing history
[12.08.21 15:50:37] angelo: see browser configurator
[12.08.21 15:50:55] hammer: didn't you try to run it through cb?
[12.08.21 15:51:07] angelo: nope
[12.08.21 15:51:15] hammer: manually generate and start
[12.08.21 15:51:19] angelo: you have to deal with pink panel first
[12.08.21 15:51:24] angelo: aah
[12.08.21 15:51:32] angelo: let's see what offrank says
[12.08.21 15:51:50] angelo: we have, as I understand, pink is the final address to get the configs and cookies
[12.08.21 15:52:07] hammer: that's where the sb starts
[12.08.21 15:52:08] hammer: Mm-hmm.
[12.08.21 17:12:32] angelo: and who here can give a clear understanding that everything works properly when robbing by logs ?
[12.08.21 17:12:32] angelo: I see everything is fine
[12.08.21 17:12:33] angelo: a client wrote me
[12.08.21 17:12:40] angelo: he's having trouble with the injector
[12.08.21 17:14:44] angelo: ` look at last they put the vnts module in, there are modes, bot mode, user mode (how Timka works, holder sees what you're doing). here's bot mode for the injections test just right or user mode when he is not at the computer. injections do not work when you start to climb, but they should work because you're supposed to be a user `
[12.08.21 17:16:40] hammer: I won't tell you on vntz, text grem
[12.08.21 17:16:51] angelo: grem ?
[12.08.21 17:16:55] angelo: who is it
[12.08.21 17:16:56] hammer: grem
[12.08.21 17:17:02] hammer: he did the module
[12.08.21 17:17:08] angelo: got it
[12.08.21 17:17:15] angelo: it's not clear if it's with vntz
[12.08.21 17:17:56] hammer: didn't get it
[12.08.21 17:18:19] angelo: no injections since yesterday
[12.08.21 17:18:27] hammer: before you turned on vntz, the inject worked, and when you went to the machine, it was cut off?
[12.08.21 17:18:37] angelo: can't say for sure
[12.08.21 17:18:45] angelo: but most likely so
[12.08.21 17:18:45] hammer: how is it related at all?
[12.08.21 17:18:53] hammer: *modules
[12.08.21 17:18:54] angelo: well, sort of
[12.08.21 17:19:01] angelo: new VNC module
[12.08.21 17:19:06] angelo: and bam the injector stopped working
[12.08.21 17:19:09] hammer: that's bullshit
[12.08.21 17:19:20] angelo: just assume it's not by accident
[12.08.21 17:19:25] angelo: arrr
[12.08.21 17:19:32] angelo: how many things aren't working
[12.08.21 17:19:36] hammer: need grem and jayme and caesar
[12.08.21 17:23:26] angelo: Jaime's gone for now
[12.08.21 17:23:45] hammer: okay, now
[12.08.21 17:24:30] hammer: 5:22 PM
you need to contact sylver and jaime
there's a desktop name check in the injector
[12.08.21 17:25:01] angelo: got it
[12.08.21 17:25:08] angelo: that's another option yes
[12.08.21 17:25:22] angelo: he is sitting under VNC and user injections should go
[12.08.21 17:25:28] hammer: I'll text Jaime, contact him too
[12.08.21 17:25:30] angelo: He wrote back to Jaime
[12.08.21 17:25:37] hammer: grab sylvester tomorrow
[12.08.21 17:25:38] angelo: sure
[12.08.21 17:25:43] hammer: I'll text Grem too, just in case
[12.08.21 17:25:43] angelo: yeah
[12.08.21 17:35:10] hammer: grem wrote, jaim too, but it's unclear if he saw it or not
[12.08.21 17:35:49] angelo: I'm in touch with the coder and the client
[12.08.21 17:35:53] angelo: described the problem
[12.08.21 17:36:21] angelo: config is not plugged into page code
[12.08.21 17:36:38] hammer: with jime?
[12.08.21 17:36:59] angelo: no
[12.08.21 17:37:08] angelo: the coder signed off who did the config
[12.08.21 17:37:17] hammer: his fault?
[12.08.21 17:37:44] angelo: dunno
[12.08.21 17:37:52] angelo: I gotta figure out why the config doesn't work
[12.08.21 17:38:27] hammer: m, anyway, go to jima, let him take a look too, it won't be worse
[12.08.21 17:38:37] angelo: sure
[12.08.21 17:38:43] angelo: he and i are inseparable.)
[12.08.21 17:40:29] hammer: hold that thought.
[12.08.21 17:40:32] hammer: there, before starting a child process, an environment variable with a given name is created and deleted after start
that's how the check works
[12.08.21 17:41:04] angelo: well, for me it's crap without Hymie honestly)
[12.08.21 17:41:10] angelo: wrote it down - I'll tell Haimi
[12.08.21 17:46:39] hammer: and sylver too
[12.08.21 17:53:33] angelo: ok
[12.08.21 17:53:39] angelo: we're on it
[12.08.21 17:53:47] angelo: I'm tired
[12.08.21 17:53:58] hammer: still no answer?
[12.08.21 17:54:03] angelo: not yet
[12.08.21 17:54:17] angelo: he was on vacation
[12.08.21 17:54:27] angelo: Probably getting his affairs in order.
[12.08.21 17:54:32] angelo: or whatever
[12.08.21 17:54:36] angelo: he's usually here
[12.08.21 17:54:54] angelo: caesar's looking to see if the config was uploaded to the bot
[12.08.21 17:55:03] hammer: is the client anxious for tomorrow?
[12.08.21 17:55:12] angelo: I don't know.
[12.08.21 17:55:16] angelo: will be patient
[12.08.21 17:55:21] angelo: no options anyway
[12.08.21 17:55:37] angelo: we can only determine at what stage of the joint
[12.08.21 17:55:46] angelo: understand the cause +-
[13.08.21 09:16:48] hammer: Hi.
[13.08.21 09:17:32] angelo: hi
[13.08.21 09:17:49] hammer: What was it?
[13.08.21 09:18:00] angelo: not yet.
[13.08.21 09:18:14] hammer: did you write to sylver?
[13.08.21 09:19:27] angelo: Hymie's doing
[13.08.21 09:19:29] angelo: I'll find out
[13.08.21 09:19:59] hammer: okay.
[13.08.21 09:40:33] angelo: I'll write down the configs from the imports today
[13.08.21 09:41:01] angelo: they seemed to download, but I couldn't download passwords/logins separately in admin area
[13.08.21 09:41:10] angelo: check again
[13.08.21 09:43:34] hammer: which one, the pink one?
[13.08.21 09:43:41] angelo: yeah
[13.08.21 09:44:00] hammer: frank, when he gets here, i'll have to go see him
[13.08.21 09:44:28] hammer: if black one has it, but the pink one doesn't pump, it's probably a problem with the pink one
[13.08.21 09:44:49] angelo: no, it's pumping logs
[13.08.21 09:44:53] angelo: we talked to him yesterday
[13.08.21 09:45:00] angelo: and I'll continue talking today
[13.08.21 09:45:35] hammer: you mean the browser or something?
[13.08.21 09:45:47] hammer: where pvgrabb logins go
[13.08.21 09:46:13] angelo: yeah
[13.08.21 09:46:42] hammer: ah, they were complaining the other day about no additions, they should have raised
[13.08.21 09:46:51] hammer: but it's still for the franc
[13.08.21 09:47:06] angelo: yeah, i found a bug yesterday
[13.08.21 09:47:08] hammer: if you have any news about the vntz, write me.
[13.08.21 09:47:15] angelo: in admin - he fixed it
[13.08.21 09:47:22] hammer: and caesar too
[13.08.21 09:47:27] hammer: what's the problem?
[13.08.21 09:47:35] angelo: ok
[13.08.21 09:47:38] angelo: don't remember
[13.08.21 09:47:42] angelo: just a little something
[13.08.21 09:47:56] angelo: you are a logician ?
[13.08.21 09:48:41] hammer: just wondering what's wrong
[13.08.21 09:48:55] hammer: well, yeah, you should write it down for the future
[13.08.21 09:49:25] hammer: for future generations
[13.08.21 10:18:37] angelo: also true
[13.08.21 10:18:46] angelo: new joint, is often long forgotten old joint

[13.08.21 10:35:42] angelo: on any bot
[13.08.21 10:42:46] hammer: from storage?
[13.08.21 10:42:54] hammer: there should be a button
[13.08.21 10:43:24] hammer: if from black, start the module manually
[13.08.21 10:43:39] angelo: yeah
[13.08.21 10:43:42] angelo: got it
[13.08.21 10:44:10] hammer: you don't need any middleware there?
[13.08.21 10:44:25] angelo: let me find out
[13.08.21 10:44:35] angelo: there was a viewer on the first one
[13.08.21 10:45:00] hammer: there should be a server, was earlier
[13.08.21 11:16:07] angelo: so bro
[13.08.21 11:16:11] angelo: I think I already warned everybody

[17.08.21 13:35:35] hammer: works and works
[17.08.21 13:35:49] angelo: there was no problem, just needed to tweak the module code

[17.08.21 15:57:13] angelo: well, the tricks aren't knocking properly
[17.08.21 15:57:16] angelo: not many bots online
[17.08.21 15:57:24] angelo: you know everything.)
[17.08.21 15:57:49] hammer: as far as I know, there are 5 detects since last check
[17.08.21 15:58:10] hammer: caesar knows, tries to clean it up, so no problems
[17.08.21 15:58:11] angelo: Zeus has few bots
[17.08.21 15:58:46] hammer: m, well, you know what to do, put bot and run all modules to start manually

[17.08.21 15:59:47] angelo: I can do it tomorrow
[17.08.21 15:59:56] angelo: run all modules by list on the test one
[17.08.21 16:00:01] hammer: that's what I'm saying, maybe detect not the bot itself, but a module
[17.08.21 16:00:09] angelo: the guys need bots
[17.08.21 16:00:15] angelo: no bots, nothing at all
[17.08.21 16:00:17] hammer: or not bots and modules at all.
[17.08.21 16:00:29] hammer: isn't there a delivery dock?
[17.08.21 16:00:39] hammer: I'll go
[17.08.21 16:00:43] angelo: honestly, I don't know how it works
[17.08.21 16:00:58] angelo: now we are waiting for the guy to tell us how the injector works under the vnts
[17.08.21 16:01:10] angelo: we just have a lot of problems (((

[17.08.21 16:04:37] angelo: okay, okay.
[17.08.21 16:04:38] hammer: to fix it if something goes wrong

[17.08.21 16:05:40] hammer: yeah everything's fine, the problem with vnts and imports, but it's solved
[17.08.21 16:05:51] hammer: and it might not be our fault, check it out
[17.08.21 16:06:26] angelo: I'm interested in the general state of our affairs
[17.08.21 16:06:53] angelo: in a good way

[17.08.21 16:09:21] hammer: and then the rock started and it turned out that there was the text of the test, that's where the teacher almost had a heart attack
[17.08.21 16:09:46] hammer: You shouldn't have put me on duty, I did everything honestly
[17.08.21 16:10:07] hammer: It's the same here, it's okay if something's wrong
[17.08.21 16:10:08] angelo: ahahaha

[17.08.21 16:14:27] hammer: is it a secret?
[17.08.21 16:14:32] hammer: they wanted one themselves
[17.08.21 16:14:44] angelo: I did it for me.)
[17.08.21 16:14:58] angelo: it's always nice to know you're on the cool team
[17.08.21 16:15:02] angelo: even if you're a janitor]

[17.08.21 16:15:39] hammer: and imagine, what's going on with others, not such professionals]
[17.08.21 16:16:02] hammer: decay, gloom, panic, hopelessness, chaos
[17.08.21 16:16:11] hammer: we have no panic
[17.08.21 16:16:45] angelo: don't know honestly, not familiar with others
[17.08.21 16:16:51] angelo: hope so )
[17.08.21 16:16:52] angelo: ok
[17.08.21 16:16:59] angelo: i'm here, i'm a little out of it
[17.08.21 16:17:04] hammer: tomorrow's Wednesday
[17.08.21 16:17:06] angelo: thank you
[17.08.21 16:17:09] angelo: yeah yeah
[17.08.21 16:17:19] angelo: i already told myself to start doing it today]
[17.08.21 16:18:04] hammer: tomorrow i'll ask jamey to write me detailed what's fixed, not gonna do it today
[17.08.21 16:18:47] angelo: removed launch restrictions on selected desktops
[17.08.21 16:18:50] angelo: in a nutshell )
[18.08.21 10:33:58] angelo: hi
[18.08.21 10:34:08] angelo: I texted Franz yesterday about the Inject
[18.08.21 10:34:38] angelo: still no response from the client, i.e. I do not even know if Adam uploaded a new build of the injector or not.
[18.08.21 10:34:48] angelo: have you seen the list from the client on the grabber?
[18.08.21 10:34:54] angelo: TK
[18.08.21 15:11:44] angelo: hey bro
[18.08.21 15:11:48] angelo: don't hold it against me
[18.08.21 15:12:01] angelo: me and Jaime have been trying to get through this nonstop
[18.08.21 15:12:05] angelo: we're screwing up again
[18.08.21 15:12:07] angelo: it's not working
[18.08.21 15:12:21] angelo: sit through vnts with client all day
[18.08.21 15:22:27] hammer: Got it. Hi.
[18.08.21 15:23:55] hammer: is it the same problem as the injector crashes under injector?
[18.08.21 15:24:06] angelo: oh yeah
[18.08.21 15:24:10] angelo: my head's spinning
[18.08.21 15:24:17] hammer: It's fixed.
[18.08.21 15:24:18] angelo: it worked yesterday, then it stopped
[18.08.21 15:24:24] angelo: configs won't connect
[18.08.21 15:24:43] angelo: that's weird
[18.08.21 15:24:57] angelo: yesterday Caesar asked Def to add the module to all bots
[18.08.21 15:25:01] angelo: today everything
[18.08.21 15:25:04] angelo: no way it works
[18.08.21 15:25:10] angelo: been sitting for a long time
[18.08.21 15:25:30] angelo: (
[18.08.21 15:25:32] angelo: shit
[18.08.21 15:26:02] hammer: vncDll?
[18.08.21 15:26:08] hammer: that name?
[19.08.21 09:55:17] angelo: hi
[19.08.21 09:55:31] angelo: yesterday I forgot to send you TOR from my client for formgraber....
[19.08.21 09:55:48] angelo: hope you had it, the client said he threw it to Franz a long time ago
[19.08.21 09:55:52] angelo: I was testing a new build of InjectDLL under VNC2 / Windows 10 64
It was run on the test bot tst31.
Went to VNC2 via HDESK and checked for code in url page from client config, it was there.

ImortDLL
The module was tested through a test bot.
There were Chromium/FF/Edga configs in the black admin.
Itoria/cookies were in each config.
There was also the beginning of the configs in the pink panel.
Loaded with all browsers turned off.
[19.08.21 10:03:19] hammer: Hi
[19.08.21 10:05:05] angelo: do you happen to know the link for VNC 2 ?
[19.08.21 10:05:18] angelo: the link where IPs with access for VNC2 appear ?
[19.08.21 10:05:52] hammer: grem did not give?
[19.08.21 10:06:03] angelo: Here, I'll write him
[19.08.21 10:06:06] angelo: Adam did
[19.08.21 10:07:49] angelo: found it
[19.08.21 10:07:53] hammer: http://195.123.212.155:8081/api/online/get vntz listing
[19.08.21 10:07:56] hammer: is it?
[19.08.21 10:07:59] angelo: yes !
[19.08.21 10:08:05] angelo: I found it too
[19.08.21 10:08:11] angelo: I usually save everything
[19.08.21 10:08:16] angelo: but there are gaps
[19.08.21 10:14:07] hammer: > so. we have a separately deployed trick as a test system, more details you can ask frank he deployed
> here's how to arrange the process so that all the new modules are first tested on this bench
> plus get some testers for modules there and let them do weekly functionality tests there
[19.08.21 10:14:19] hammer: that's what Frances told me
[19.08.21 10:14:37] hammer: frank is not there yet, I spoke with him yesterday, he will find out the access
[19.08.21 10:15:00] hammer: he should give it out to you to test it on this system
[19.08.21 10:15:24] angelo: our booth means there will be terrible lags (
[19.08.21 10:15:46] angelo: but here you should understand that modules can often conflict with each other
[19.08.21 10:15:58] hammer: I haven't seen it myself yet, at least I'll get access to admins to be able to look, I sit like an owl, I can't see a damn thing
[19.08.21 10:16:00] angelo: got it
[19.08.21 10:16:12] angelo: I understand.
[19.08.21 10:16:18] angelo: but !
[19.08.21 10:16:23] angelo: the owl can hear well
[19.08.21 10:16:35] angelo: and I think the owl has good night vision ))
[19.08.21 10:16:36] angelo: so
[19.08.21 10:16:45] hammer: we'll see.)
[19.08.21 10:17:24] hammer: While I was figuring it out, there are case sensitive links in config, released a version without case sensitive links.
Checked it worked fine.
Need to run it in battle, let the client watch.
[19.08.21 10:17:37] angelo: Yeah.
[19.08.21 10:17:39] hammer: is this from jayme, did you tell caesar to bay?
[19.08.21 10:18:00] angelo: not yet
[19.08.21 10:18:00] hammer: so the client can see the new version
[19.08.21 10:18:02] angelo: let me know
[19.08.21 10:18:12] angelo: Adam's pouring into battle groups
[19.08.21 10:18:32] hammer: and who updates the module?
[19.08.21 10:19:07] angelo: Caesar updates
[19.08.21 10:19:14] angelo: but Adam does it
[19.08.21 10:19:16] angelo: I'll report back
[19.08.21 10:19:19] hammer: that is the place where the modules are, who puts them there?
[19.08.21 10:19:31] angelo: Caesar
[19.08.21 10:19:37] hammer: and adam is already running it, so the bots were updated to the newest ones from the storing place
[19.08.21 10:19:38] angelo: but adam gives out access
[19.08.21 10:20:23] angelo: unsubscribes to tsez
[19.08.21 10:20:54] angelo: in 10 min he will upload
[19.08.21 17:15:04] angelo: How come?
[19.08.21 17:15:09] angelo: it's been days now
[19.08.21 17:15:11] angelo: yesterday
[19.08.21 17:15:23] angelo: they uploaded new modulus on zevs groups and it does not work
[19.08.21 17:15:24] angelo: arr
[19.08.21 17:15:27] hammer: vntz again?
[19.08.21 17:15:39] angelo: we're having a hard time
[19.08.21 17:15:43] angelo: inject under VNC
[19.08.21 17:16:25] hammer: and I already wrote in my report that we defeated the thing, 64xbit version works fine and you can't take your eyes off it, it's expensive, especially for clients
[19.08.21 17:16:40] hammer: So, tear up the report and throw it in the trash?
[19.08.21 17:16:47] angelo: ))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
[19.08.21 17:16:50] angelo: that made me laugh.)
[19.08.21 17:16:57] angelo: wait
[19.08.21 17:17:04] angelo: it's just a little thing
[19.08.21 17:17:15] angelo: maybe there's a bug in the admin
[19.08.21 17:17:44] hammer: okay, I'll make a footnote that it was at the time of writing, and then we'll see
[19.08.21 17:18:04] angelo: the problem is that everything works
[19.08.21 17:18:07] angelo: on the test bot
[19.08.21 17:18:14] angelo: the client himself came to us on VM
[19.08.21 17:18:20] angelo: and poked and prodded and everything worked
[19.08.21 17:18:31] hammer: Yeah.
[19.08.21 17:18:41] hammer: well, it's the so-called presence effect
[19.08.21 17:19:26] hammer: when you want it not to work and you have to show it to make sure, it works like clockwork
[19.08.21 17:19:32] hammer: and vice versa
[19.08.21 17:21:13] angelo: there are just a lot of nuances
[19.08.21 17:21:13] hammer: no problem, I'll write, it was worked out on tests, sent to the bay for check on workers
[19.08.21 17:21:21] angelo: are those bots uploaded, are those bots uploaded
[19.08.21 17:21:48] hammer: That's a whole other story
[19.08.21 17:22:28] angelo: well
[19.08.21 17:22:40] angelo: there was already a problem, two days searching for which config and which one was uploaded
[19.08.21 17:22:44] angelo: inconvenient
[19.08.21 17:22:55] angelo: we are like blind kittens sometimes
[19.08.21 17:25:42] hammer: in black admin area there were chrome/FF/Edga configs.
[19.08.21 17:25:47] hammer: there was no ee.
[19.08.21 17:25:58] angelo: nope.
[19.08.21 17:26:03] hammer: what axis?
[19.08.21 17:26:10] angelo: 10
[19.08.21 17:26:12] angelo: 64
[19.08.21 17:26:15] angelo: version 20
[19.08.21 17:26:19] hammer: ok
[19.08.21 17:26:25] angelo: not bad

[23.08.21 09:29:40] angelo: Frank will beep
[23.08.21 09:29:52] angelo: i think now to check inject under vntz2 again
[23.08.21 09:30:06] hammer: what does jime say?
[23.08.21 09:31:48] angelo: what to say, everything was fixed and then vnts2 is lame
[23.08.21 09:31:48] angelo: also, my birthday is coming up and I'm getting mopey
[23.08.21 09:35:50] angelo: this reminds me of a joke: doctor ignore me. - Next.
[23.08.21 09:35:57] hammer: )
[23.08.21 09:36:27] angelo: what to do if you're older than christ and you think you got nothing in life?
[23.08.21 09:36:46] hammer: who said that?
[23.08.21 09:36:47] angelo: 35 and you think your life went down the drain
[23.08.21 09:36:49] angelo: me
[23.08.21 09:36:55] hammer: you didn't make it
[23.08.21 09:36:58] hammer: come on
[23.08.21 09:36:59] angelo: nothing
[23.08.21 09:37:05] hammer: it depends on what you compare it to
[23.08.21 09:37:15] hammer: I'll restart torus
[23.08.21 09:37:33] angelo: go ahead
[23.08.21 09:42:40] hammer: Well, there's no point in being sad
[23.08.21 09:43:54] hammer: first of all, as I read somewhere, you already won the race for life by coming in first
[23.08.21 09:44:11] hammer: secondly; there are negroes in Africa
[23.08.21 09:44:19] hammer: that's a big plus
[23.08.21 09:44:32] angelo: )))
[23.08.21 09:44:35] angelo: great
[23.08.21 09:44:45] angelo: yeah, very close bro
[23.08.21 09:44:57] angelo: and autumn and longing are synonymous
[23.08.21 09:44:59] hammer: seriously, a lot of people don't make it to this age
[23.08.21 09:45:20] hammer: and it doesn't matter if they achieve something in their opinion or not
[23.08.21 09:45:32] hammer: what's there to be sad about?
[23.08.21 09:45:48] hammer: you're alive, you're an eagle, you got a job
[23.08.21 09:46:08] angelo: well, i guess it's the stability
[23.08.21 09:46:32] angelo: waiting for something, I don't know what
[23.08.21 09:46:32] hammer: here comes the telly two subscriber, he's got a full gigabyte of internet
[23.08.21 09:46:40] hammer: you know those commercials

[23.08.21 09:46:59] hammer: happy
[23.08.21 09:47:05] hammer: and here's a brick from the roof
[23.08.21 09:47:13] hammer: blood, guts on the wires
[23.08.21 09:47:26] hammer: a second ago it was, now it's a pile
[23.08.21 09:47:39] hammer: life is changing rapidly, nothing to be sad about
[23.08.21 09:47:41] angelo: ahahaha, if you think like that it should be easier
[23.08.21 09:47:50] angelo: I have a friend without hands
[23.08.21 09:47:53] angelo: no hands at all
[23.08.21 09:48:02] angelo: he's always in a positive mood
[23.08.21 09:48:08] hammer: well
[23.08.21 09:48:12] angelo: sometimes it's embarrassing when you walk like shit
[23.08.21 09:48:35] hammer: how many people with limited resources, what should they do?
[23.08.21 09:48:50] hammer: jump off the balcony?
[23.08.21 09:48:52] angelo: I have no idea
[23.08.21 09:49:01] hammer: live and be happy, even in little things
[23.08.21 09:49:15] angelo: you should play sports
[23.08.21 09:49:25] angelo: it gives energy and positivity
[23.08.21 09:49:32] angelo: thank you]
[23.08.21 09:49:40] angelo: it made me feel better and I didn't even have to drink
[23.08.21 09:50:32] hammer: alcohol is useful in small doses, and the number of doses is not specified)
[23.08.21 09:50:53] angelo: ))))) but I'd rather omit the alcohol
[23.08.21 09:50:59] angelo: I'll take it till New Year's Eve
[23.08.21 09:51:01] hammer: well, here's how I see it
[23.08.21 09:51:12] angelo: go ahead
[23.08.21 09:51:27] hammer: you should live your life the way you like it, not to satisfy someone else's ambitions
[23.08.21 09:51:35] hammer: if you want, do it
[23.08.21 09:51:44] hammer: but it's achieved-not achieved, that's it
[23.08.21 09:51:51] hammer: in front of whom do you show off?)
[23.08.21 09:51:57] hammer: you can't fool yourself
[23.08.21 09:52:49] hammer: if you don't like or need something, you shouldn't force yourself so that people would think something wrong, but he has this or that
[23.08.21 09:52:52] angelo: i regard the word "achieved" a little differently, or rather i put a different meaning into it
[23.08.21 09:53:00] angelo: exactly what you just said
[23.08.21 09:53:35] angelo: i want to do what i want (believe me, it's not spitting on the ceiling and having dough)
[23.08.21 09:54:00] angelo: probably one more time to stop a little, revise life and correct the vector of movement
[23.08.21 09:54:29] hammer: spitting at the ceiling, even with money, is not the solution)
[23.08.21 09:54:41] hammer: this is depravity and degradation)
[23.08.21 09:54:49] angelo: exactly
[23.08.21 09:54:54] angelo: I have so many plans for my life !
[23.08.21 09:55:00] angelo: and i'm sitting here sour cabbage
[23.08.21 09:55:03] angelo: what an asshole
[23.08.21 09:55:07] hammer: but manuka's husband is a tractor driver, while yours is sitting at the computer, probably playing all the time
[23.08.21 09:55:16] hammer: Learn to be a tractor driver
[23.08.21 09:55:31] angelo: Yeah, no, I've been doing manual labor
[23.08.21 09:55:35] angelo: I did a lot of things
[23.08.21 09:55:40] angelo: I'd rather keep it as a hobby
[23.08.21 09:56:03] angelo: thanks a lot, buddy.
[23.08.21 09:56:06] angelo: Feel better.
[23.08.21 09:56:09] hammer: I once wanted to learn to be a welder, there were two-month courses
[23.08.21 09:56:22] angelo: very little as a welder now
[23.08.21 09:56:34] angelo: good ones are rare
[23.08.21 09:56:38] angelo: good profession
[23.08.21 09:56:53] hammer: you didn't get it, it went the other way)
[23.08.21 09:56:55] angelo: I used to make furniture
[23.08.21 09:57:02] angelo: yeah, and right
[23.08.21 09:57:21] angelo: but manual labor is also good, now this trend is stable
[23.08.21 09:57:41] angelo: I'll be cutting table from oak soon
[23.08.21 09:57:43] angelo: and a sofa
[23.08.21 09:58:06] hammer: I always like it when people do something with their hands
[23.08.21 09:58:23] angelo: man is a creator by nature
[23.08.21 09:58:35] hammer: when from different raw materials beauty comes out
[23.08.21 09:59:15] angelo: what are you doing?
[23.08.21 09:59:21] angelo: with hands
[23.08.21 09:59:51] hammer: I used to whittle and cut with knife
[23.08.21 09:59:57] hammer: but it's a dabble
[23.08.21 10:00:04] hammer: drawing
[08.23.21 10:00:11] angelo: ohh.
[23.08.21 10:00:17] angelo: so you're already creative
[23.08.21 10:00:42] angelo: that's cool, know how to draw, I always admired such people
[23.08.21 10:01:03] hammer: sometimes I used to write, but now you remember and think, what the same crap, I wouldn't do it now
[23.08.21 10:01:24] hammer: but at least there was something to remember)
[23.08.21 10:01:49] angelo: you shouldn't be critical, i sometimes reread my poems, it's creepy] but it was cool at that moment
[23.08.21 10:02:03] hammer: yeah.)
[23.08.21 10:02:11] angelo: but now i try to do everything with a pussy
[23.08.21 10:02:21] angelo: leaving him bright spots
[23.08.21 10:03:14] angelo: and working with my hands is twice as attractive, but there's more hair
[23.08.21 10:03:32] angelo: okay, sorry I'm a flounder today
[23.08.21 10:03:36] angelo: I don't like drs.
[23.08.21 10:04:21] hammer: It's okay.
[23.08.21 10:04:34] hammer: Who likes it?

[23.08.21 10:06:07] angelo: i remember i was really depressed. I was flying 4 km from a parachute.
[23.08.21 10:06:15] angelo: like that was gone =)
[23.08.21 10:08:13] angelo: I recommend it to you, too, when I'm not feeling too good.
[23.08.21 10:08:42] hammer: we'll see.)
[23.08.21 10:08:49] hammer: the main thing is that with a parachute)

[23.08.21 11:49:48] angelo: let me double-check
[23.08.21 11:49:58] angelo: Frank said VNC is still problematic
[23.08.21 11:50:08] angelo: trying to test inject under VNC
[23.08.21 15:19:18] angelo: now there is a difficulty with storage

[24.08.21 10:32:10] angelo: we have more than one
[24.08.21 10:32:24] angelo: I can't run VNC through one panel
[24.08.21 10:32:27] hammer: adam is online
[24.08.21 10:32:42] angelo: you need another admin panel

[24.08.21 14:08:07] angelo: That's right.
[24.08.21 14:08:46] angelo: But the admin is working
[24.08.21 14:08:53] hammer: yourself?
[24.08.21 14:09:06] angelo: don't ask
[24.08.21 14:09:08] angelo: i don't know
[24.08.21 14:09:13] angelo: adam says it works
[24.08.21 14:09:17] angelo: and it worked
[25.08.21 10:11:22] angelo: hi.
[25.08.21 10:11:34] angelo: yesterday, himey and i double-checked the inject
[25.08.21 10:11:39] angelo: on the test bot and on the zevs bot
[25.08.21 10:11:52] angelo: data is coming to the client
[25.08.21 10:12:11] angelo: and checked the module during module overload to detect the problem(probable)
[25.08.21 10:12:14] angelo: everything is fine
[25.08.21 10:12:16] angelo: waiting for vntz
[25.08.21 10:12:22] angelo: I'll report back

[25.08.21 10:34:29] angelo: I wrote to def yesterday

[25.08.21 10:34:41] angelo: Defa
[25.08.21 11:40:07] angelo: Vntz is working
[25.08.21 11:50:11] hammer: Holy shit.

[25.08.21 11:50:30] angelo: =))))))))))))
[25.08.21 12:28:37] angelo: we got the server locked down
[25.08.21 12:28:45] angelo: dnog7
[25.08.21 12:28:49] angelo: Def said
[25.08.21 12:33:19] hammer: for what reason?
[25.08.21 12:33:21] angelo: they're fixing
[25.08.21 12:33:32] angelo: sorry def is reporting to me (
[25.08.21 12:33:44] hammer: complaint on fraud looks like
[25.08.21 12:33:54] hammer: they're dropping the suspicion
[25.08.21 12:34:41] hammer: you got veldon online?
[25.08.21 12:36:43] angelo: nope
[25.08.21 12:36:49] angelo: what is fraud ?
[25.08.21 12:42:58] hammer: fraud, plain and simple
[25.08.21 12:43:56] hammer: they see, for example, a lot of shit going on from the address, mailing, or IP got exposed, got on blacklist
[25.08.21 12:44:24] hammer: they started complaining, the server got suspended, now they gotta tell him we had nothing to do with it
[25.08.21 12:44:26] angelo: got it
[25.08.21 12:44:43] angelo: I just don't get it
[25.08.21 12:44:46] angelo: what kind of server
[25.08.21 12:44:51] angelo: where's the admin link on torus
[25.08.21 12:45:13] hammer: "if thou hast blocked our server"
[25.08.21 12:45:26] angelo: but the admin area works
[25.08.21 12:45:30] angelo: what's the server doing?
[25.08.21 12:45:36] hammer: what got blocked then?
[25.08.21 12:45:48] angelo: I was just telling Def's words
[25.08.21 12:45:55] angelo: it's hard as hell to talk to him
[25.08.21 12:45:59] hammer: )
[25.08.21 12:45:59] angelo: unrealistically difficult
[25.08.21 12:46:05] hammer: you're not alone)
[25.08.21 12:46:14] angelo: I'm cursing out loud
[25.08.21 12:46:18] hammer: never mind, if you say they'll fix it, they will)
[25.08.21 12:46:20] angelo: It pisses me the fuck off
[25.08.21 12:46:30] angelo: I gotta see this
[25.08.21 12:46:50] angelo: [05:33:43] <defender@> what exactly is not working?
[05:33:52] <azot> injections via VNC
[05:34:00] <azot> inject module
[05:34:13] <azot> no data going into panel
[05:34:15] <azot> to Zeus
[05:34:21] <defender@> but why do you need pink?
[05:34:31] <azot> ok, how to run vntz ?!
[05:35:19] <azot> in black I run the module directly, in pink I get access by pressing Get, is it not so ?!
[05:35:23] <defender@> press start on any one and see what command will be in black
[05:35:32] <defender@> so
[05:36:13] <azot> that means I can give vntz command in black admin ?
[05:37:06] <azot> write the command
[25.08.21 12:47:11] angelo: and silaaaah
[25.08.21 12:47:19] angelo: well, it's a simple question
[25.08.21 12:47:21] hammer: "with the processes we are waiting for a working build, on the dnog will work when we make another server"
[25.08.21 12:47:23] angelo: just give me an answer.
[25.08.21 12:47:32] hammer: they're building a new server.
[25.08.21 12:47:43] hammer: and you have to start vnts module and that's it?
[25.08.21 12:47:51] angelo: start it up yes
[25.08.21 12:47:54] angelo: and give access
[25.08.21 12:48:02] angelo: everything was done through the pink one
[25.08.21 12:48:05] hammer: vncDll start
[25.08.21 12:48:16] angelo: not like that if anything
[25.08.21 12:48:17] hammer: but check with caesar to run it in black
[25.08.21 12:48:28] angelo: otherwise vnc2Dll start
[25.08.21 12:48:41] hammer: well, i don't know about the module names, it's just an example
[25.08.21 12:48:52] angelo: I got it
[25.08.21 12:49:15] hammer: but you'd need a vntz getlist
[25.08.21 12:49:36] hammer: where the accesses go, from it already go to the pink one, right?
[25.08.21 12:49:46] angelo: yeah
[25.08.21 12:49:52] angelo: in the pink one you just press get
[25.08.21 12:49:58] angelo: and it gives you an access address with a password
[25.08.21 12:50:05] angelo: that's it
[25.08.21 12:50:12] hammer: it just starts up and gets it automatically
[25.08.21 12:50:21] hammer: but here you have to do it by hand
[25.08.21 12:51:04] angelo: now I don't get it
[25.08.21 12:51:19] angelo: I have the link
[25.08.21 12:51:20] angelo: with ipses
[25.08.21 12:51:24] angelo: but I'm not there
[25.08.21 12:51:57] hammer: and the module started on the bot?
[25.08.21 12:52:03] angelo: yeah
[25.08.21 12:52:09] angelo: started the machine now
[25.08.21 12:52:11] angelo: restarted
[25.08.21 12:52:13] angelo: check
[25.08.21 12:52:20] hammer: there is nothing to prescribe besides start?
[25.08.21 12:52:30] hammer: like getdata or something?
[25.08.21 12:53:06] angelo: I wish somebody would tell me.
[25.08.21 12:53:17] angelo: usually you just run a module and run to the pink room
[25.08.21 12:53:58] hammer: go to grem and caesar
[25.08.21 12:54:27] angelo: you already went with cesu
[25.08.21 12:54:28] hammer: when you started from pink, in black only on start and all?
[25.08.21 12:54:29] angelo: nothing yet
[25.08.21 12:54:32] angelo: unsubscribe to grem
[25.08.21 12:54:40] angelo: no
[25.08.21 12:54:50] angelo: now asked a client in pink to press get
[25.08.21 12:54:54] angelo: nothing came up
[25.08.21 12:55:11] hammer: black did not respond?
[25.08.21 12:55:12] angelo: it's easier to write a command
[25.08.21 12:55:15] angelo: not this
[25.08.21 12:55:18] angelo: no
[25.08.21 12:55:41] hammer: try writing it by hand
[25.08.21 12:56:12] hammer: if it starts successfully, but isn't on the list, go to Grem
[25.08.21 12:56:20] hammer: must be lost somewhere
[25.08.21 12:56:28] angelo: but to prescribe by hands what ?)
[25.08.21 12:56:38] hammer: start module manually
[25.08.21 12:56:45] hammer: from black
[25.08.21 12:56:54] angelo: started
[25.08.21 12:57:03] hammer: successfully?
[25.08.21 12:57:15] angelo: yeah
[25.08.21 12:57:40] hammer: it sucks when you can't see a damn thing, blindly giving advice like that
[25.08.21 12:57:50] hammer: are you on the vntz getlist?
[25.08.21 12:58:12] angelo: ok
[25.08.21 12:58:14] angelo: just a minute.
[25.08.21 12:58:24] hammer: if not, go to grem, but he'll probably send it to frank
[25.08.21 12:58:40] hammer: a circle of directions just all over the world
[25.08.21 12:58:42] angelo: that's what you call bullshit
[25.08.21 12:58:49] angelo: when you could make a light redmi
[25.08.21 12:59:05] hammer: what can you do
[25.08.21 12:59:11] hammer: our hands are not for boredom
[25.08.21 12:59:32] hammer: go I don't know where, find I don't know what
[25.08.21 13:12:10] angelo: fuck!
[25.08.21 13:12:29] angelo: i already made the most delicious pizza
[25.08.21 13:21:22] angelo: well
[25.08.21 13:21:29] angelo: we found out that the second VNC was temporary
[25.08.21 13:21:35] angelo: and now we have a third
[25.08.21 13:21:39] angelo: Fuck!
[25.08.21 13:23:42] angelo: strange thing, my bot did not come to life after overload, why?!
[25.08.21 13:26:48] hammer: bot not on your machine?
[25.08.21 13:27:00] angelo: on himey
[25.08.21 13:27:04] angelo: ah
[25.08.21 13:27:07] angelo: dead
[25.08.21 13:27:08] angelo: on mine
[25.08.21 13:27:25] hammer: hmm.
[25.08.21 13:27:31] hammer: well, if it wasn't eaten by an av
[25.08.21 13:27:43] angelo: without av it's hard for him
[25.08.21 13:27:54] hammer: what's it like now, not a planner start?
[25.08.21 13:28:05] angelo: dunno
[25.08.21 13:28:09] angelo: I don't have any tricks
[25.08.21 13:28:17] hammer: it's Caesar again
[25.08.21 13:28:22] angelo: silent

[25.08.21 13:29:23] hammer: I'll try Caesar
[25.08.21 13:30:45] hammer: what words?
[25.08.21 13:31:01] angelo: excuse me?
[25.08.21 13:31:07] hammer: I thought everybody listened to what Franz said
[25.08.21 13:31:11] hammer: what?
[25.08.21 13:31:12] angelo: aah!
[25.08.21 13:31:16] angelo: when he wrote

Hi all, when will you finish the vntz provided by zeus in full? What's the problem again?
[25.08.21 13:32:53] hammer: this?
[25.08.21 13:33:11] angelo: Hi all, guys, I'm really asking everyone to be a little faster in their projects/tasks. We have a lot of hang-ups. Comes to the absurd, for weeks waiting for the server or some aces. I strongly recommend that all urgent matters that I indicated immediately close.
Otherwise, the next WP you extremely unpleasant surprise.
I do not need wagons here, who do not want to work - I'll find a replacement.
[25.08.21 13:33:13] angelo: This
[25.08.21 13:33:28] hammer: Ah, I didn't see it.
[25.08.21 13:33:36] angelo: you're crazy

[25.08.21 13:33:44] angelo: general
[25.08.21 13:33:51] angelo: where did he write about vntz?!
[25.08.21 13:33:51] hammer: I don't have it
[25.08.21 13:33:58] angelo: well, then don't))
[25.08.21 13:34:03] angelo: this is a public chat room
[25.08.21 13:34:06] angelo: it should be
[25.08.21 13:36:20] hammer: found it, but I'm not there
[25.08.21 13:36:32] angelo: Well, you should have.
[25.08.21 13:36:36] angelo: it can be interesting
[25.08.21 13:36:45] angelo: and when i'm in the mood, it can be fun
[25.08.21 13:36:49] angelo: but closer to night
[25.08.21 13:37:13] hammer: rfr lj,fdbnmcz nelf&
[25.08.21 13:37:20] angelo: well, dude.
[25.08.21 13:37:21] hammer: how do I get in?

[25.08.21 13:37:37] angelo: you need an admin
[25.08.21 13:37:57] hammer: sylver
[25.08.21 13:38:10] angelo: I don't know who we have now
[25.08.21 14:15:07] hammer: added
[25.08.21 14:15:20] hammer: caesar answered?
[25.08.21 14:15:36] angelo: no answer
[25.08.21 14:15:39] angelo: but we did
[25.08.21 14:15:41] hammer: and me
[25.08.21 14:15:48] angelo: how to enter vnts
[25.08.21 14:15:51] angelo: to our bot
[25.08.21 14:15:59] hammer: how?
[25.08.21 14:16:01] angelo: Hymie saw his password
[25.08.21 14:16:06] angelo: what was it before
[25.08.21 14:16:10] angelo: in lists
[25.08.21 14:16:12] angelo: )
[25.08.21 14:16:13] hammer: okay
[25.08.21 14:16:19] angelo: crazy, but there's no other way
[25.08.21 14:16:25] hammer: so it came after all
[25.08.21 14:16:36] hammer: okay, not a distraction
[25.08.21 14:17:17] hammer: our big problem is that sometimes you can't get an answer
[25.08.21 14:17:17] hammer: It's understandable that everyone's busy, but still
[25.08.21 14:26:50] angelo: everything has a limit
[25.08.21 14:26:53] angelo: I'm going to take my son for a ride
[25.08.21 14:26:59] angelo: but that's 30 minutes
[25.08.21 14:27:02] angelo: 40
[25.08.21 14:27:11] angelo: I don't *** in my heart
[25.08.21 14:28:11] hammer: you can do it with training
[25.08.21 14:28:23] hammer: first you don't answer for an hour, then two
[25.08.21 14:28:29] hammer: you know the drill
[25.08.21 14:28:29] angelo: ahahahahahahahahahaha
[25.08.21 14:28:33] angelo: funny )))
[25.08.21 14:28:38] angelo: i can't do that ))
[25.08.21 14:28:53] angelo: but I can delay with the report
[25.08.21 14:28:56] angelo: but I'll warn you
[25.08.21 14:28:57] hammer: not everyone can. i understand.
[25.08.21 14:30:08] angelo: I can not do two things: go off to the offsite for shit on something important, and stupidly do not respond, knowing that I'm expected. I have extremes the other way around, I get really worried/nervous when something goes wrong.
[25.08.21 14:31:20] angelo: And I can get really nervous.
[25.08.21 14:31:27] hammer: there's a balance, not always something depends on you, it's no use worrying when you can't help it
[25.08.21 14:31:33] angelo: when i'm late, i get nervous like a first grader
[25.08.21 14:31:43] hammer: Yeah, I know, you can get yourself wound up
[25.08.21 14:31:50] angelo: you should always strive for balance, i understand
[25.08.21 14:32:05] angelo: Yeah, I also lose weight when I'm nervous
[25.08.21 14:32:12] angelo: that's why i can't put on weight ))
[25.08.21 14:32:26] angelo: me and himey will write in the report about the joint with trike after overload
[25.08.21 14:32:37] hammer: ok
[25.08.21 14:32:46] hammer: whatever else caesar has to say
[25.08.21 14:33:22] hammer: bot used to write the start in the task scheduler, I don't see how it is now
[25.08.21 14:34:13] angelo: not himey got the error
[25.08.21 14:34:16] angelo: don't ask
[25.08.21 14:34:17] hammer: frank's testing stand broke down, he'll give me access, I'll finally see how it works now
[25.08.21 14:34:19] angelo: haven't seen it yet
[25.08.21 14:34:30] angelo: ok
[25.08.21 14:43:04] angelo: went away bro
[25.08.21 16:50:58] angelo: text Caesar if anything
[26.08.21 15:09:41] angelo: Now Hymie will come and we'll watch his new build
[26.08.21 15:09:54] angelo: but he says the module is not simple
[26.08.21 15:09:56] hammer: Okay.
[26.08.21 15:10:17] angelo: to change it and wait for objective result, don't break it
[26.08.21 15:10:42] hammer: is he there by inject under vntz?
[26.08.21 15:11:05] angelo: Yep
[26.08.21 15:11:27] hammer: what about the inject?
[26.08.21 15:11:46] angelo: well, in general, it works under Vntz
[26.08.21 15:11:48] hammer: does it detect/not detect, does it work together with Vnts?
[26.08.21 15:11:56] angelo: it just doesn't work with two browsers
[26.08.21 15:12:06] angelo: it's fine without vnts
[26.08.21 15:12:11] angelo: no detects
[26.08.21 15:12:23] angelo: I'll run a new crypt
[26.08.21 15:12:36] angelo: everything is stable
[26.08.21 15:12:49] angelo: just some changes again
[26.08.21 15:12:59] angelo: you know how it works, don't touch it
[26.08.21 15:12:59] hammer: got it, waiting
[26.08.21 15:13:10] angelo: now the client decided to add config again
[26.08.21 15:13:14] hammer: it's like that everywhere)
[26.08.21 15:13:20] hammer: The best is an enemy of the good
[26.08.21 15:13:23] angelo: and it must be filled via DEF, and how it will fill there dunno...
[26.08.21 15:15:06] hammer: rocket kicked today
[26.08.21 15:15:27] angelo: it sure did
[26.08.21 15:15:30] hammer: I thought I was the only one who crashed, then I finally went in and almost everyone was offline
[26.08.21 15:15:32] angelo: like a mare in labor
[26.08.21 15:15:45] angelo: Good thing it's rare
[26.08.21 15:16:08] angelo: i got used to it, at first i shit myself, there was no external toad and everything went down...well i thought i worked, went to look for a new one ))
[26.08.21 15:16:20] hammer: yeah, removed from rocket)
[26.08.21 15:16:37] angelo: fuck angie - delete him
[26.08.21 15:16:42] angelo: anything is possible ) )
[26.08.21 15:40:03] hammer: <flip> Found a problem, if the user is running a browser (chrome), then chrome does not work on vnc, if running on vnc, then the user does not work. Why it does not understand. There are some problems with vnc, it works and then it does not. Couldn't get it to work.
[26.08.21 15:40:10] hammer: Do you know whose it is?
[26.08.21 15:48:10] angelo: Jaime )
[26.08.21 15:48:29] angelo: must be from yesterday
[26.08.21 15:48:51] angelo: he's already debound - check it out
[26.08.21 15:48:53] angelo: we'll be right there
[27.08.21 09:24:40] hammer: Hey, what's up with the new build?
[27.08.21 09:27:27] angelo: one worked and broke the rest
[27.08.21 09:27:28] angelo: hi
[27.08.21 09:27:34] angelo: just messing with Jaime
[27.08.21 09:27:37] angelo: will work

[27.08.21 09:27:48] angelo: yesterday was a plug, but we have to finish it seriously
[27.08.21 09:28:43] hammer: worked where?
[8/27/221 09:32:12] hammer: A lawsuit for at least $150k filed against the living members of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain's heirs says that the cover child looks "like a sex worker".
[27.08.21 09:32:31] hammer: he doesn't look like a worker at all
[27.08.21 09:32:51] angelo: it worked under VNC on two browsers, but then everything crashed
[27.08.21 09:32:56] angelo: ))))))
[27.08.21 09:33:01] hammer: and 200 bucks were already received and even spent, apparently
[27.08.21 09:33:07] angelo: everybody wants money
[27.08.21 09:33:08] hammer: on what, exactly)
[27.08.21 09:33:10] angelo: I would sue too
[27.08.21 09:33:22] hammer: he's never been to the beach?
[27.08.21 09:33:31] hammer: there's some naked kids running around
[27.08.21 09:33:45] angelo: it's the states, man.)
[27.08.21 09:33:53] hammer: Go back to your parents
[27.08.21 09:33:54] angelo: You got a way to make money? Do it
[27.08.21 09:35:17] angelo: I wonder what happened to the guys from Petersburg
[27.08.21 09:35:28] angelo: they were able to break the face id there
[27.08.21 09:35:34] angelo: And they sued for a big sum
[27.08.21 09:35:37] angelo: very big
[27.08.21 09:35:47] angelo: it's interesting, I think so
[27.08.21 09:35:55] angelo: it was a couple of million bucks
[27.08.21 09:50:49] hammer: which browsers stopped working?
[27.08.21 10:00:40] angelo: Chrome
[27.08.21 10:00:43] angelo: 64
[27.08.21 10:00:50] angelo: FF too
[27.08.21 10:00:56] angelo: but the main thing Chromium is broken
[27.08.21 10:01:10] hammer: Who's the third?
[27.08.21 10:01:20] angelo: believe it or not, I was worried about Inject half the night (
[27.08.21 10:01:27] angelo: start drinking
[27.08.21 10:01:31] hammer: I do
[27.08.21 10:01:34] hammer: no need
[27.08.21 10:01:50] angelo: well, we were just focused on chromium
[27.08.21 10:01:55] angelo: he is
[27.08.21 10:02:04] angelo: claiming the Inject
[27.08.21 16:08:28] hammer: what news?
[27.08.21 16:08:59] angelo: nothing yet
[27.08.21 16:09:05] angelo: where is frank ?!
[27.08.21 16:09:12] angelo: how is the module testing system
[27.08.21 16:09:21] hammer: it's lying around
[27.08.21 16:09:32] angelo: and frank where ?!
[27.08.21 16:09:35] hammer: said as soon as he picks it up, he'll give him access
[27.08.21 16:09:40] hammer: don't know
[27.08.21 16:09:47] angelo: got you
[27.08.21 16:10:10] hammer: is admin down again?
[27.08.21 16:10:11] angelo: do you know how superbrowser is ?
[27.08.21 16:10:14] angelo: dunno
[27.08.21 16:10:18] angelo: didn't look now
[27.08.21 16:10:24] angelo: It was fine this afternoon
[27.08.21 16:11:27] hammer: veldon is doing magic, on his last build his computer got magma temperature from overheating
[27.08.21 16:11:42] hammer: that was when he tried to build
[27.08.21 16:12:00] hammer: now he's doing it again
[27.08.21 16:13:29] hammer: he's got diarrhea
[27.08.21 16:15:36] angelo: What a bummer
[27.08.21 16:15:46] angelo: this better be good.)
[27.08.21 16:17:24] angelo: Hope Zeus isn't too sad
[27.08.21 16:32:40] hammer: Zeus answers sadly: "Sadness is eating me up, I would like to see the sun." The client Zeus answers: "Sadness is eating me up; I'd like to see an antique. I would like an antique here."
[27.08.21 16:33:06] hammer: Pushkin has many such sorrows, I can't count them all
[27.08.21 16:33:54] hammer: the tale of Zeus, where three coders under the window gave birth to a project, in a barrel, into the sea
[27.08.21 16:34:02] hammer: you know
[27.08.21 16:45:44] angelo: you're a goddamn literalist, let me tell you.
[27.08.21 16:46:11] angelo: the main thing is that he understands that everyone is trying for him
[27.08.21 16:48:32] hammer: Zeus the client here answers:

"Sadness is eating me up;

A wonderful miracle

I'd like an antique here.

The bot is in the car, the bot is imported;

Wonderful, right, everyone is jealous.

imports grabber sings

Yes, and the browser is gnawing,

Well, the config is not simple,

All the passwords are golden,

Cookie is pure emerald;

But maybe people are lying.

To Zeus, Weldon replies:

"The light about the antique is true;

It's a miracle I know;
[27.08.21 16:49:02] angelo: you're such a poet
[27.08.21 16:49:08] hammer: and then it started spinning, and it's still spinning, but it's no good
[27.08.21 16:49:13] angelo: no, dad, i just want a woman.)
[27.08.21 16:49:17] hammer: I just changed a few words
[27.08.21 16:49:29] hammer:]
[27.08.21 16:49:32] angelo: I'm a construction worker
[27.08.21 16:49:43] angelo: I need to make a beautiful pallet out of shit and sticks
[27.08.21 16:49:58] angelo: why don't you buy a fucking ready-made one like other people?
[27.08.21 16:50:10] angelo: but no, we want to do it with our hands and no way at all
[27.08.21 16:50:33] hammer: that's good, if not to fanaticism
[27.08.21 16:50:44] angelo: not so fanatical
[27.08.21 16:50:52] angelo: i made the balcony
[27.08.21 16:50:56] angelo: insulated
[27.08.21 16:51:03] angelo: and made a beautiful trim
[27.08.21 16:51:19] angelo: and didn't want plastic window sills, they're bothering me
[27.08.21 16:51:35] angelo: it's my place of work, I want comfort
[27.08.21 16:52:09] hammer: great
[27.08.21 16:52:13] angelo: I've never done this before
[27.08.21 16:52:21] angelo: never worked pine
[27.08.21 16:52:28] angelo: let's say
[27.08.21 16:52:38] angelo: well, at least he saved 40-50K
[27.08.21 16:52:56] angelo: no, 30-40
[27.08.21 16:53:54] hammer: I'll send it to Weldon, he's not saying anything today, he doesn't want to tell me what's going on there
[27.08.21 16:54:11] angelo: ahahaha!)
[27.08.21 16:54:12] angelo: ok
[27.08.21 16:56:24] hammer: there's probably a siren howling, red emergency lamps going round and round with screaming, "melting reactor rods during assembly, leave the room", meldon himself in a protective suit runs to the exit, stumbles and at the last second makes it to the door from the room, closes it behind him, takes off his mask, wipes sweat from his forehead and goes to the kitchen, thinking, how this damned antic got him down already
[27.08.21 16:57:36] hammer: no, I won't throw it down so as not to aggravate it before the weekend, he's busy there anyway, why bother?
[27.08.21 16:59:14] angelo: well, maybe he already poured the glass,
♪ and his soul is full ♪
♪ Not of fucked upness and grief ♪
But the great feeling of fuckin' up!
[27.08.21 16:59:40] hammer: Well, then he's the one to collect it.)
[27.08.21 16:59:44] angelo: Today tomorrow and a little bit
We'll finish the inject and everything.
♪ Then hold on, banker American ♪
♪ Already on our table, there'll be coconut ♪
[27.08.21 16:59:52] angelo: =)
[27.08.21 17:00:31] angelo: I'll back off.
[27.08.21 17:00:36] angelo: I have to chop
[27.08.21 17:05:18] hammer: Inject is not a wolf, you can't feed him with your legs,
He's as capricious as a young mamsel.
But if you set it up right,
The secrets of all the sites will be in your control.

[27.08.21 17:12:13] angelo: ))))))))))))
[27.08.21 17:12:17] angelo: nice bro )

Bourgeois abroad swallow Carvalol
The banker's boss yells in frustration
"Eats national hackers, get my diarrhea."
The assembly went to battle in the night, and Weldon saw it off.
"Well done!"

[27.08.21 17:49:36] angelo: everything ?
[27.08.21 17:49:39] angelo: off to bed ?
[27.08.21 17:49:59] hammer: if you want, you can throw in the general
[27.08.21 17:50:23] hammer: if it's not forbidden there
[27.08.21 17:50:34] angelo: no )
[27.08.21 17:50:40] angelo: I'll send you the latest with your copywriter
[27.08.21 17:50:48] hammer: without)
[27.08.21 17:50:51] hammer: anonymous)))
[27.08.21 17:50:58] angelo: okay)
[27.08.21 17:51:28] angelo: though damn Zeus
[27.08.21 17:51:37] angelo: that's right, don't mention client's names (
[27.08.21 17:52:31] angelo: ok
[27.08.21 17:52:38] angelo: we need to finish
[27.08.21 17:52:40] angelo: and dinner
[27.08.21 17:52:54] angelo: just in case
[27.08.21 17:52:58] angelo: have a nice weekend
[27.08.21 17:53:02] angelo: don't drink too much
[27.08.21 17:53:18] hammer: The verdict is out: "Well done!"
[27.08.21 17:53:20] angelo: And don't forget about the disease
[27.08.21 17:53:22] hammer: You can do that.
[27.08.21 17:53:50] angelo: now
[27.08.21 17:53:51] hammer: I don't drink at all
[27.08.21 17:53:51] angelo: )
[27.08.21 17:54:45] angelo: me neither ((
[27.08.21 17:54:52] angelo: but I'd open a bottle now

[27.08.21 17:55:01] hammer: sobriety is not a sentence.)
[27.08.21 17:55:04] angelo: and look for me on Monday
[27.08.21 17:55:12] angelo: no argument there
[27.08.21 17:55:25] angelo: i didn't know how i stopped drinking
[27.08.21 17:55:27] angelo: once and for all
[27.08.21 17:55:33] angelo: and for a year I think - why
[27.08.21 17:55:41] hammer: it's not good
[27.08.21 17:56:09] angelo: you know, they invented taste in alcohol to justify intoxication
[27.08.21 17:56:14] angelo: i'm 100% convinced of that
[27.08.21 17:56:44] angelo: no kid who drinks anything with alcohol (not chemistry) will ever say it tastes good
[27.08.21 17:57:22] hammer: when I'm a little drunk, I understand when people like this elevated mood, a little euphoria and lightness, but there's a fine line
[27.08.21 17:57:36] hammer: a little too much and that's it, you're drunk
[27.08.21 17:57:59] hammer: I don't understand when people get drunk out of their minds, what's the use, you don't remember anything, you get sick too
[27.08.21 17:58:25] hammer: you can bang your head against the wall that way, the result is the same, and there is less damage to your health
[27.08.21 18:19:22] hammer: have a nice weekend
[27.08.21 18:28:40] angelo: have a nice weekend !
[30.08.21 09:11:36] hammer: Hi, did you write something? It didn't come.
[30.08.21 09:12:08] angelo: hi
[30.08.21 09:12:16] angelo: just my weekend wishes
[30.08.21 09:14:10] hammer: any news on vnts?
[30.08.21 09:14:24] angelo: about the inject
[30.08.21 09:14:36] angelo: that's more accurate.)
[30.08.21 09:14:43] angelo: there is - need to test
[30.08.21 09:14:45] hammer: yeah, inject under Vntz
[30.08.21 09:14:49] hammer: ok)
[31.08.21 09:21:45] hammer: Hey
[31.08.21 09:21:45] angelo: Hello, darling.
[31.08.21 09:22:03] hammer: what's new in inject?
[31.08.21 09:22:34] angelo: good by the injector, now uploading to the release and testing again
[31.08.21 09:22:40] angelo: then upload to live bots
[31.08.21 09:22:49] angelo: Hymie defeated one little thing
[31.08.21 09:22:51] hammer: yeah, test one was successful?
[31.08.21 09:22:55] angelo: chrome doesn't break now
[31.08.21 09:22:57] angelo: Mm-hmm.
[31.08.21 09:23:03] hammer: great
[31.08.21 09:23:04] angelo: no problems noticed
[31.08.21 09:23:17] angelo: only on vnts comments
[31.08.21 09:23:21] hammer: report back after test
[31.08.21 09:23:24] hammer: which ones?
[31.08.21 09:23:24] angelo: i take notes
[31.08.21 09:23:40] angelo: closing VNC leaves chromium proces
[31.08.21 09:24:01] hammer: only the process?
[31.08.21 09:24:03] angelo: if it was appropriately under vnc open
[31.08.21 09:24:11] angelo: uh-huh
[31.08.21 09:24:15] hammer: that means the browser is closed, but the process is still running
[31.08.21 09:24:30] angelo: no, Chromium is open too, on hidden deskop as I understand
[31.08.21 09:24:45] angelo: when you access VNC again, Chrome opens too
[31.08.21 09:24:52] angelo: that's probably not good
[31.08.21 09:25:39] hammer: what if you close it under vnc before vnc is closed?
[31.08.21 09:25:48] angelo: it's okay
[31.08.21 09:25:53] hammer: and in general, on the client machine you can't see it, right?
[31.08.21 09:25:59] angelo: you can't see it
[31.08.21 09:26:06] angelo: but it interfered with the injection
[31.08.21 09:26:13] angelo: why leave the process behind ?
[31.08.21 09:26:30] angelo: no sense, + 1 to paling
[31.08.21 09:27:09] hammer: just close the browser after yourself
[31.08.21 09:27:10] angelo: only when session break it's convenient, you reconnect and chrome with tabs open
[31.08.21 09:27:24] angelo: well, we just noticed it
[31.08.21 09:27:34] angelo: it's not up to us to decide if it's convenient
[31.08.21 09:27:39] hammer: it repeats steadily?
[31.08.21 09:29:08] hammer: you just need to inform us that there is such an inconvenience, close the browser behind you, otherwise the process will stay
[31.08.21 09:29:13] hammer: only with chrome?
[31.08.21 09:31:12] angelo: only chrome
[31.08.21 09:31:18] angelo: but Hymie conquered this affliction
[31.08.21 09:31:24] angelo: so not critical
[31.08.21 09:31:55] hammer: ok, report back after you test it
[31.08.21 09:32:06] angelo: ok
[31.08.21 09:33:33] hammer: are you getting paid yet?
[31.08.21 09:33:54] angelo: why?
[31.08.21 09:33:55] angelo: 31.
[31.08.21 09:34:07] hammer: well, 31st of the month.
[31.08.21 09:34:16] angelo: L is logic )))
[31.08.21 09:34:23] angelo: i think it's different for Franz )
[31.08.21 09:34:45] hammer: well, we'll see
[31.08.21 09:40:26] angelo: don't forget, there were beats from him
[31.08.21 09:40:31] angelo: clearly he's not jumping for joy
[31.08.21 09:40:47] angelo: he's already borrowed himself
[31.08.21 09:43:41] hammer: there were complaints about the vntz module, that they can't properly insert the ready-made into the bot
[31.08.21 09:43:57] hammer: storage connection problem and other stuff
[31.08.21 09:44:05] hammer: what do you have to do with this?
[31.08.21 09:44:13] hammer: i figured the admins were screwed
[31.08.21 09:44:27] angelo: i hope so
[31.08.21 09:44:29] hammer: the module is ready, but they just can't add it into the work properly
[31.08.21 09:44:39] angelo: but the client is not very happy that the inject doesn't work
[31.08.21 09:44:42] angelo: there's a bug, too
[31.08.21 09:44:49] hammer: bugs and stuff are bullshit, they always were and always will be
[31.08.21 09:45:14] hammer: it's better to have them than to keep silent and save the problems and then everything fucks up
[31.08.21 09:45:35] hammer: there are bugs, people work, they're not looking for themselves
[31.08.21 09:46:06] hammer: like who said "he who does nothing is not wrong"
[31.08.21 09:47:07] hammer: And the client is unhappy, sorry, there's a conflict of modules at work
[31.08.21 09:47:16] hammer: no shit
[31.08.21 09:47:34] angelo: yeah, he was holding it in, but yesterday he didn't say much
[31.08.21 09:47:42] angelo: i kinda cut the corners as much as i could
[31.08.21 09:47:58] angelo: explained that the module whatever it was not one line of code
[31.08.21 09:48:10] angelo: and any adjustment is a big job
[31.08.21 09:48:28] angelo: and there are a lot of variables to work with
[31.08.21 09:48:34] hammer: he was unhappy with the injector under vnts?
[31.08.21 09:49:40] hammer: I'll ask Brookes about hp, he seems to sense such things
[31.08.21 09:51:04] angelo: ahahahahahah))) brooks is eternal hamster ))
[31.08.21 09:51:13] angelo: yeah, he was talking about inject
[31.08.21 10:20:52] hammer: back off
[31.08.21 10:20:59] angelo: yeah
[31.08.21 10:31:02] angelo: test positive
[31.08.21 11:16:27] hammer: detail then what you got
[31.08.21 11:16:45] hammer: brooks says it's today, he's got a feel for it
[31.08.21 11:17:33] angelo: aahahahahaha ))
[31.08.21 11:17:40] angelo: Sherlock.
[31.08.21 11:17:57] hammer: well, unless stern shows up, then crash and burn
[31.08.21 11:18:04] angelo: Without VNC the inject works.
Through the GNC user, there was a crash from the session. Crash repeated more than two times.
Through Proxy 9092 does not enter VNC.
Injects work through GNC via /user /HDESK /HDESK bot
I was testing a build of the Inject module from 08/30.
Chrome now stopped crashing when loading the inject.
Tested through Proxy US for greater effect.

Release
Test at HDESC.
Amazon crashed on opening. Probably a proxy issue.
Tiaa is inserted.
Amazon insertion is there.

HDESK bot test
Tiaa/Amazon inserts are there
[31.08.21 11:18:35] hammer: only on amazon tested?
[31.08.21 11:19:14] angelo: on amazon and tiaa
[31.08.21 11:19:25] angelo: for now yes
[31.08.21 11:19:28] angelo: still coming
[31.08.21 11:19:31] hammer: who's tia?
[31.08.21 11:19:33] angelo: but the module works
[31.08.21 11:19:52] angelo: tiaa.org
[31.08.21 11:19:55] hammer: what's left chrome process?
[31.08.21 11:20:15] angelo: well, inject doesn't care about it anymore
[31.08.21 11:20:25] angelo: but I would remove it
[31.08.21 11:20:33] angelo: why bother to watch
[31.08.21 11:20:44] angelo: ask the client
[31.08.21 11:20:52] angelo: maybe he cares
[31.08.21 11:21:34] hammer: ah, process stays, but inject says https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g5LfHelOwI&ab_channel=%D0%A4%D0%A0%D0%90%D0%93%D0%9C%D0%95%D0%9D%D0%A2%D0%AB%D0%94%D0%9B%D0%AF%D0%9C%D0%9E%D0%9D%D0%A2%D0%90%D0%96%D0%90
[31.08.21 11:23:47] angelo: ))))))))) yes
[31.08.21 11:25:29] hammer: is it something about retirement savings?
[31.08.21 11:25:40] hammer: I've never seen such a site before.
[31.08.21 11:29:08] angelo: I don't know, I don't go there in particular.
[31.08.21 11:35:47] hammer: how did amazon crash?
[31.08.21 11:41:21] angelo: never mind
[31.08.21 11:41:29] angelo: the internet speed was at 1 kb
[31.08.21 11:41:33] angelo: we'll double-check
[31.08.21 11:43:39] hammer: ibd is an imitation of a stormy activity?)
[31.08.21 13:13:19] hammer: New Year is coming up, there's nothing left
[31.08.21 13:13:26] hammer: a little pre-New Year's mood

[31.08.21 13:13:54] angelo: I'm gonna be gone an hour and a half
[31.08.21 13:14:12] hammer: ok
[31.08.21 16:26:36] angelo: Brooks' gut seems to have let him down
[31.08.21 16:26:50] hammer: well, stern's online
[31.08.21 16:27:18] hammer: and he and Frances even crossed paths, were online at the same time
[31.08.21 16:27:28] hammer: so I guess tomorrow
[31.08.21 16:27:58] hammer: " hello
he should add it in vnts to disable unnecessary processes when he shuts down
and what processes are problematic, what's wrong there?"
[31.08.21 16:28:04] hammer: it's from Frances
[31.08.21 16:28:18] hammer: I also told jima
[31.08.21 16:29:37] angelo: maybe we caused a panic for nothing?
[31.08.21 16:42:56] hammer: on the bill?
[31.08.21 16:46:51] angelo: it doesn't go off with vntz chrome
[31.08.21 16:52:12] hammer: well, as you can see, he said to take it out
[31.08.21 16:52:32] hammer: jime replied
[31.08.21 16:52:35] hammer: --user-data-dir="C:\Users\ivan\AppData\Local\Temp\izfoduteotinac\C" at startup chrome has this key izfoduteotinac - name of virtual desktop, so I think you should kill all chrome that have it in command line
[31.08.21 16:57:03] angelo: geez
[31.08.21 16:57:07] angelo: ENGINE WORKS
[31.08.21 17:10:35] hammer: Wow!
[31.08.21 17:11:00] hammer: however, success was expected, professionals are working
[31.08.21 17:11:08] angelo: ahahahah ))
[31.08.21 17:11:09] angelo: exactly !
[31.08.21 17:12:23] hammer: not even like that
[31.08.21 17:12:42] hammer: was destined to succeed
[31.08.21 17:12:58] angelo: but I was afraid
[31.08.21 17:13:12] angelo: client has a lot of modules on bots
[31.08.21 17:13:22] angelo: I was afraid of conflict
[31.08.21 17:13:28] angelo: with some module
[31.08.21 17:13:40] hammer: who knows. who knows.
[31.08.21 17:13:42] angelo: you can't tell
[31.08.21 17:14:53] hammer: today the inject came out a winner, but what obstacles of bitter destiny, hardships and sorrows await him in the future, what tops does he have to conquer, coming out a winner out of all trials?
[31.08.21 17:14:59] hammer: see in the next episode
[31.08.21 17:15:06] hammer: tomorrow
[31.08.21 17:15:29] angelo: come on!
[31.08.21 17:15:45] angelo: there's a poet in you
[31.08.21 17:16:18] hammer: sequel to such blockbusters as "Inject and the sloppy config" and "Inject and the insidious vntz"
[31.08.21 17:16:25] hammer: )
[31.08.21 17:16:46] hammer: well, jime will clean it up. i think chrome will terminate correctly
[31.08.21 17:17:26] hammer: by sites he specified two
[31.08.21 17:47] angelo: tomorrow 1
[31.08.21 17:17:54] angelo: are you waiting for school/garden ?
[31.08.21 17:18:03] hammer: Nope.
[31.08.21 17:18:13] angelo: No way
[31.08.21 17:18:30] hammer: although i'd love to go back to school, fifth grade
[31.08.21 17:18:44] angelo: well, i was veiling a different question
[31.08.21 17:18:49] hammer: no
[31.08.21 17:18:58] angelo: got it
[31.08.21 17:19:03] angelo: and I have a garden tomorrow
[31.08.21 17:19:17] angelo: sad and happy time
[31.08.21 17:19:21] hammer: I'd go to the garden too.)
[31.08.21 17:19:38] angelo: me too, though memories are sometimes very "not very"
[31.08.21 17:19:53] hammer: yeah, you don't appreciate in time, and then you remember
[31.08.21 17:20:35] angelo: at least I'll have more time
[31.08.21 17:20:43] angelo: and my wife won't have her eye twitching
[31.08.21 17:20:44] hammer: I don't know, I don't have any bad memories from school
[31.08.21 17:20:55] angelo: I have bad memories from everything
[31.08.21 17:21:02] angelo: And the kids' camp is fucked up
[31.08.21 17:21:15] angelo: i had a bad childhood
[31.08.21 17:21:28] hammer: We certainly had enough morons in class, but they were our morons, no conflicts
[31.08.21 17:21:52] angelo: I was special, there are some defects
[31.08.21 17:22:28] angelo: You know kids are cruel
[31.08.21 17:22:39] hammer: yes
[31.08.21 17:24:50] hammer: well, both two in toad
[31.08.21 17:25:23] hammer: oh, and the rocket's in.
[31.08.21 17:26:19] hammer: the problem sites are those where the inject doesn't work?
[31.08.21 17:26:48] hammer: is it definitely config's fault?
[31.08.21 17:27:24] hammer: that is, in all cases that were problematic, where we looked, there was a problem in the config, right?
[31.08.21 17:31:34] angelo: well, I guess so
[31.08.21 17:31:42] angelo: we solved it this way
[31.08.21 17:31:51] angelo: the client will look at the config - all the urls
[31.08.21 17:32:00] angelo: where there is no code insertion, we'll look
[31.08.21 17:32:10] angelo: where there will be an inject, we give the config coder
[31.08.21 17:32:42] hammer: okay, I'll write to Frances
[31.08.21 17:44:45] hammer: no response
[31.08.21 17:45:12] hammer: I hate it when they ask for answer and then keep quiet if they got it or not
[31.08.21 17:47:06] angelo: he was bitten by stern
[31.08.21 17:47:09] angelo: a long time ago
[31.08.21 17:57:17] hammer: curse "urging a response, in response unanswered silence"
[31.08.21 17:57:49] hammer: I didn't get it myself, don't worry
[31.08.21 18:04:08] hammer: it looks like tomorrow or today, but much later
[31.08.21 18:04:30] hammer: I won't wait, see you tomorrow
[31.08.21 18:04:32] angelo: )) yeah
[31.08.21 18:04:42] angelo: I started peeing and he got off
[31.08.21 18:04:43] angelo: come on
[31.08.21 18:04:45] angelo: rest
[31.08.21 18:04:52] angelo: I got clients back
[31.08.21 18:05:06] angelo: so there's gonna be a lot more work
[31.08.21 18:05:28] hammer: when I come back tomorrow, everyone is drowning in luxury, sacks of money, gold, diamonds, rubies are sparkling, everyone is happy, smiling and ruddy
[31.08.21 18:05:45] angelo: ))))
[31.08.21 18:05:52] angelo: well, let's hope you're a prophet)
[31.08.21 18:05:55] angelo: see you tomorrow, bro
[31.08.21 18:06:08] hammer: well, sooner or later it will be
[31.08.21 18:06:17] hammer: come on, have a good trip to the day care center
[31.08.21 18:06:36] angelo: Thanks.
[31.08.21 18:06:40] angelo: I'll cry tomorrow
[31.08.21 18:06:45] angelo: But I'm a man and I can take it
[31.08.21 18:06:47] angelo: )
[31.08.21 18:06:55] hammer: man
[31.08.21 18:07:02] angelo: I will
[01.09.21 09:21:12] hammer: Hi.
[01.09.21 09:21:28] hammer: guys the problem with vnts2 appeared in trike
he was giving out of note privat on many bots
looked in the t-tax bots, a lot of open browsers
now on some bots where chrome used to turn on, now not turn on
Owner
9:02 AM
is this a problem with vntz?
Not with the injector?
9:03 AM
yes with vntz
Owner
9:03 AM
you open chrome on a hidden desktop and the chrome screen has this error?
9:03 AM
Yes when navigating to sites
Owner
9:03 AM.
99% it's the injector
because jaime just finished the injector in chrome
write in the channel trick_pr, jaime is not here
and write that the error in the injectDll
test it on the bench
i think it will work
When you go to any sites or any specific sites?
9:06 AM
differently
can't say specific
On some bots let me go to the same site
some don't
Owner
9:06 AM
what's up
9:06 AM
Let's say one let in chase.com
Try bankofamerica.com
Gives out an endorsement from nothin private
back to the site
Owner
9:07 AM
so you test the injector without vntz
9:07 AM
seemed to test yesterday everything was ok
in the morning
In the evening, the same thing happened
Owner
9:08 AM
you just found something under the vntz which couldn't be detected on the test bench, that's all
it's the eternal problem of botnet debugging
before chrome wasn't injected into vntz, now it is - you've seen it
and maybe that's the reason why not much data is coming from the bots
9:09 AM
the point is it's supposed to be injected by itself and it wasn't
the vnts2 module has a bot mode, i.e. a Holder
they're supposed to be triggered
but they didn't
So we started to figure out what's up
yesterday was a victory for the indexes began to work
Injects.
before that they didn't even work through the user mode
it was ok on the test cars, they worked, we were testing, when it came to the battle bots, they just stopped working, so yesterday we won
[01.09.21 09:21:38] hammer: there was a problem with the inject under Vntz
[01.09.21 09:22:00] angelo: yeah
[01.09.21 09:22:02] angelo: treated yesterday
[01.09.21 09:22:13] angelo: opened bot saw 50 chromes
[01.09.21 09:22:24] angelo: there was a hitch
[01.09.21 09:22:32] angelo: there was a problem with chromes
[01.09.21 09:22:35] angelo: at Unc
[01.09.21 09:23:55] angelo: inject has a maximum of 10 chromes
[01.09.21 09:24:12] angelo: even 50 processes open looks like shit
[01.09.21 09:25:04] angelo: did anyone respond to what FRantz said about making VNC edits ?
[01.09.21 10:19:55] angelo: it didn't work out with zp
[01.09.21 10:20:04] angelo: brooks needs to reconsider his instincts
[01.09.21 10:32:21] hammer: better tomorrow than nothing
[01.09.21 10:32:31] hammer: something will fall off and won't go where it needs to go
[01.09.21 10:32:57] hammer: https://memepedia.ru/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gw05nd1wwxa-1.jpg
[01.09.21 10:33:21] angelo: ))))
[01.09.21 10:33:33] angelo: you know, I've been enjoying your company a lot lately
[01.09.21 10:33:59] angelo: you make me feel good, and it's not jokes/humor, but in general
[01.09.21 10:36:05] hammer: always a pleasure)
[01.09.21 15:06:41] angelo: (8:04:51 AM) kalgon: and counterplay stopped working
(8:04:53 AM) kalgon: with the shifter
(8:05:01 AM) kalgon: on the shifter
[01.09.21 15:07:01] angelo: (8:06:34 AM) kalgon: see what I noticed
(8:06:39 AM) kalgon: like a native vnts fixed
(8:06:43 AM) kalgon: so there was a problem with it
[01.09.21 15:13:36] angelo: tell me, I'm dumb
[01.09.21 15:13:49] angelo: native vntz and now what is vntz
[01.09.21 15:13:52] angelo: I don't get it
[01.09.21 15:31:10] hammer: as far as I know, grebin gave robin the vntz source code, he modified it to fit robin's needs and it was loaded as a module
[01.09.21 15:31:16] hammer: maybe about that
[01.09.21 15:31:32] hammer: or maybe it was when they modified the injector for vntz
[01.09.21 15:33:11] hammer: ask when exactly
[01.09.21 15:33:28] hammer: it's not clear what exactly
[01.09.21 15:34:52] angelo: started yesterday
[01.09.21 15:34:56] angelo: with Inject
[01.09.21 15:35:04] angelo: but the buttons don't work
[01.09.21 15:35:16] hammer: ah, well, that's with the change of the injector, then
[01.09.21 15:35:41] angelo: let me check
[01.09.21 15:35:47] hammer: but this is about buttons, what's it about?
[01.09.21 15:36:08] angelo: yesterday yes
[01.09.21 15:36:11] angelo: by evening
[01.09.21 15:36:17] angelo: injected at night
[01.09.21 15:36:28] hammer: buttons in vntz, wrong weather, bad luck in private life, bad mood. everything injected
[01.09.21 15:37:38] hammer: m
[01.09.21 15:38:18] angelo: ahaha
[01.09.21 15:38:25] angelo: shit, I thought I fell asleep in my chair today
[01.09.21 15:38:30] angelo: I'm shocked myself old man
[01.09.21 15:38:38] hammer: write to jime, let him figure out what else he's guilty of and be ready to repent
[01.09.21 15:39:07] hammer: found a concentration of evil

there is no such limitation that from one machine only from one id will work?
I.e. the first time we ran with a 32-character id, it stuck (saved) in the system, the next runs with another id won't let it pass?
We tested it on one and the same machine.
there was a session with 0107421839210943964947312558758330851017 - via 195.123.212.155
through procla now it's coming up too, strange
7:16 AM.
vntz is being implemented, that's why it's possible
7:23 AM

    there is no such limitation that only one id will work from one machine?

no, but id + group must be unique, because their hashes are used as login and password
[02.09.21 09:12:40] angelo: Haimi said that they fixed VNC, now he needs to check his fixes
[02.09.21 09:12:49] hammer: well, it's not that bad
[02.09.21 09:13:18] hammer: "Well look, I need some features to be disabled in chrome, I disable them through the command line, so these parameters need to be added by Graham when he uploads his copy of chrome. I'll see that they are already there and I won't touch it."

encountered this problem
on some bots
when connecting to vnts reconnect
although before 0 they were working fine
76.167.207.226
135.134.167.8
all
9:57 AM
what does reconnect mean? why is it bad?
9:57 AM
it doesn't open vntz
reconnect to the server
and yesterday it opened on these bots
so it doesn't reconnect at all
9:58 AM
i.e. the module does not work on these bots?
9:58 AM
says reconnect
yes
9:58 AM
Does restarting the module not help?

    9:59 AM
    no
    no it doesn't.
[02.09.21 10:02:49] hammer: Mm-hmm.

[02.09.21 16:58:50] hammer: broken connections
[02.09.21 16:58:56] angelo: then on the new seventh started glitching with Inject
[02.09.21 16:58:56] hammer: on vntz
[02.09.21 16:59:10] angelo: and then another xls client started bugging me
[02.09.21 16:59:23] angelo: what's up with Jaime now?

[02.09.21 17:19:19] hammer: can't read it?
[02.09.21 17:19:50] hammer: you need to tell caesar that fresh bots die there, apparently, because of the macaffi detector, to double-check and clean it up, but it's gone
[02.09.21 17:20:13] angelo: shit, that sucks
[02.09.21 17:20:16] angelo: too bad.
[02.09.21 17:20:23] angelo: sorry there's no tg

[02.09.21 17:32:40] angelo: but we didn't get there
[02.09.21 17:32:46] angelo: you have to go through config
[02.09.21 17:32:53] angelo: not all urls get info
[02.09.21 17:32:54] hammer: let's consider that you didn't boo
[02.09.21 17:33:00] hammer: it's not our fault
[02.09.21 17:33:11] angelo: actually, yes
[02.09.21 17:33:19] angelo: is it cold ?
[02.09.21 17:33:23] angelo: we're having a blast today
[02.09.21 17:33:26] hammer: I told frank that we agreed that the client will check his links in the config and report the problematic ones
[02.09.21 17:33:27] angelo: 14 degrees
[02.09.21 17:33:37] angelo: okay.
[02.09.21 17:33:41] angelo: but see how it turned out
[02.09.21 17:34:00] hammer: I'm just writing a report.
[02.09.21 17:34:37] angelo: you think so?
[02.09.21 17:34:38] angelo: by

[02.09.21 17:36:11] hammer: pvgrab
[02.09.21 17:36:20] hammer: not much yet
[02.09.21 17:36:39] hammer: i don't write a report on network, for example
[02.09.21 17:37:07] hammer: they seem to have given it to caesar, but it is either not used or it is not clear who is checking it
[02.09.21 17:37:36] hammer: tomorrow i will ask him to build a test bot.
[02.09.21 17:39:26] hammer: texted caesar about detects, hope he gets it
[02.09.21 17:40:35] hammer: you also come before me, if he doesn't get off, just in case, if you don't forget, be kind enough to let him know about it
[02.09.21 17:42:37] angelo: ok, I'll write it down
[02.09.21 17:42:47] angelo: yeah, i'll be there at 9:00
[02.09.21 17:42:49] angelo: or 10

[02.09.21 17:43:36] angelo: ))))
[02.09.21 17:43:46] angelo: and I have customers now if they set up work
[02.09.21 17:43:51] angelo: I'll be up all night again
[02.09.21 17:44:00] angelo: I don't know, things aren't going well for them
[02.09.21 17:44:30] angelo: all our clients aren't very businesslike
[02.09.21 17:44:37] angelo: everybody's getting complacent
[02.09.21 17:44:38] angelo: how many clients do we have bro?
[02.09.21 17:45:11] hammer: don't know
[02.09.21 17:45:48] hammer: I think, nobody knows, not all of them are visible
[02.09.21 17:46:08] hammer: well, us, at least, who will report?)
[02.09.21 17:46:24] hammer: things get done and that's it
[02.09.21 17:46:31] angelo: yeah, i'm interested
[02.09.21 17:46:47] angelo: i wonder where the money comes from
[02.09.21 17:46:49] angelo: if all I've seen so far are poor
[02.09.21 17:47:13] angelo: I didn't have time to talk to Norbet and Tramal
[02.09.21 17:47:14] angelo: they're tough guys
[02.09.21 17:47:31] angelo: haven't seen Tarant for a long time
[02.09.21 17:47:44] hammer: poor by whose standards?)
[02.09.21 17:47:46] angelo: Man, I want to chat with zuckers
[02.09.21 17:47:55] hammer: it's relative too
[02.09.21 17:48:14] angelo: poor, what do you call a couple thousand bucks
[02.09.21 17:48:14] angelo: that's poor
[02.09.21 17:48:31] hammer: Well.
[02.09.21 17:48:51] angelo: small groups
[02.09.21 17:48:59] angelo: Zeus of course is a big group
[02.09.21 17:49:04] angelo: but it's also small

[02.09.21 17:49:15] angelo: bread
[02.09.21 17:49:28] hammer: well, there's a lot of money involved
[02.09.21 17:49:36] angelo: it's interesting to chat with them, but we have a locker on Franz, and he's a real spy
[02.09.21 17:49:38] hammer: no mind, no memory
[02.09.21 17:50:03] angelo: how else?! If he steals, then millions, if he rapes, then the princess
[02.09.21 17:50:20] angelo: i am not a fan of taking risks for the sake of 100K rubles]
[02.09.21 17:50:42] angelo: maybe at 16 years old it was relevant, but not now!)
[02.09.21 17:51:03] hammer: Oh, you mean it.
[02.09.21 17:51:13] hammer: no, it's not 100k.)
[02.09.21 17:51:33] angelo: there's usually 5-20 k
[02.09.21 17:52:16] hammer: usually in bits
[02.09.21 17:52:29] angelo: well, the equivalent is in millions
[02.09.21 17:52:42] angelo: there are guys who serve lockers
[02.09.21 17:52:59] angelo: they have salary if not % 4K+
[02.09.21 17:53:18] angelo: you know, to risk your freedom for 10 years for the sake of salary javist signor ?)
[02.09.21 17:53:42] hammer: they know where they went)
[02.09.21 17:54:09] angelo: i knew it too, but i'm looking further away
[02.09.21 17:54:23] angelo: and think what's ahead
[02.09.21 17:54:42] hammer: and what looms ahead?)
[02.09.21 17:55:01] angelo: I don't know.
[02.09.21 17:55:07] angelo: but definitely not business
[02.09.21 17:55:10] angelo: I'm sure of it
[02.09.21 17:55:46] hammer: what business, first you need confidence and peace of mind)
[02.09.21 17:55:52] angelo: my gut is always torn apart, like a devil on the left and an angel on the right, on my shoulders
[02.09.21 17:56:05] angelo: no, i've been playing this game for almost 10 years
[02.09.21 17:56:18] angelo: fuck it
[02.09.21 17:56:28] hammer: not to panic from rustling and passing cars behind the window)
[02.09.21 17:57:20] hammer: well, let's hope we're in for a great, all-consuming, all-consuming bright future)
[02.09.21 17:57:31] hammer: happiness to all
[02.09.21 17:58:34] angelo: after my childhood, frankly, I'm still afraid of doorbells
[02.09.21 17:58:59] hammer: they bother me more at the intercom
[02.09.21 17:59:03] angelo: afraid they came for me
[02.09.21 17:59:15] angelo: it's the association bro
[02.09.21 17:59:29] angelo: waiting for who?)
[02.09.21 17:59:51] hammer: no, i usually don't wait for anybody, that's why they bother)
[02.09.21 17:59:55] hammer: e
[02.09.21 18:00:00] angelo: aah!)
[02.09.21 18:00:13] angelo: i was troubled in my youth
[02.09.21 18:00:23] angelo: if the doorbell rings, it's some kind of shit!)
[02.09.21 18:00:28] angelo: or whores
[02.09.21 18:00:36] angelo: but they were carrying a shit =)
[02.09.21 18:01:15] hammer: )

[02.09.21 18:02:33] hammer: yeah, i was about to leave, but i got a problem with the three
[02.09.21 18:02:47] hammer: we gotta figure out what's in there
[02.09.21 18:02:57] angelo: tell me about the three tomorrow
[02.09.21 18:03:08] angelo: I've been given time, I'll get some groceries quickly
[02.09.21 18:03:11] hammer: with bells on
[02.09.21 18:03:25] hammer: Break a leg
[02.09.21 18:03:38] angelo: no fart!
[02.09.21 18:03:52] hammer: Also correct
[03.09.21 09:19:24] angelo: hey bro
[03.09.21 09:19:30] angelo: wrote to cesar this morning
[03.09.21 09:19:34] angelo: by tric
[03.09.21 09:19:42] hammer: Hi, thank you.
[03.09.21 09:19:42] angelo: just watched vnts+inject
[03.09.21 09:19:55] angelo: everything's fine
[03.09.21 09:19:56] hammer: what is it showing?
[03.09.21 09:20:02] angelo: chrome closes when vntz is closed
[03.09.21 09:20:07] angelo: not pisu already))
[03.09.21 09:20:09] hammer: is chrome dead on seven?
[03.09.21 09:20:16] hammer: just in case)
[03.09.21 09:20:34] hammer: on 10 jima wrote that it was fine, and you didn't look at 7
[03.09.21 09:20:45] hammer: so now 7 makes you happy too?
[03.09.21 09:20:48] angelo: my joke was relevant today
[03.09.21 09:20:54] angelo: [00:35:11] <green> rocket went up, and still no french
[00:35:49] <azot> "it didn't work" thought Franz =)
[00:36:21] <green> =)
[03.09.21 09:21:02] hammer: )
[03.09.21 09:21:29] hammer: today for sure
[03.09.21 09:23:00] hammer: you didn't give it to the bay?
[03.09.21 09:23:32] angelo: we did
[03.09.21 09:24:04] hammer: well, have a nice voyage
[03.09.21 09:26:00] angelo: wait
[03.09.21 09:26:04] angelo: we'll find out
[03.09.21 09:26:07] angelo: there are two modes
[03.09.21 09:26:11] angelo: hdesk
[03.09.21 09:26:17] angelo: and hdesk
[03.09.21 09:26:19] angelo: bot
[03.09.21 09:29:11] hammer: hidden table and hidden bot table? what's the difference, there's always vntz under bot
[03.09.21 09:29:24] hammer: or not?
[03.09.21 09:29:49] hammer: okay, I'm not interrupting, just tell me what happened
[03.09.21 09:31:46] angelo: i don't know.
[03.09.21 09:31:59] angelo: check with grem and report back.)
[09.09.21 10:48:59] angelo: hi!
[09.09.21 10:49:05] angelo: how are you doing ?
[09.09.21 11:01:10] hammer: Hi, I'm fine, but the vntz is kicking something
[09.09.21 11:01:34] hammer: no eugene
[09.09.21 11:01:40] hammer: do you know where he is?
[09.09.21 11:01:57] hammer: Oh, he's here
[09.09.21 11:04:33] angelo: vntz is not that kicky
[09.09.21 11:04:54] angelo: like the fact that Hymie didn't see the changes made to VNC on some bots
[09.09.21 11:04:59] angelo: WHERE was the module download
[09.09.21 11:05:05] angelo: vnc3dll
[09.09.21 11:15:35] hammer: maybe the latest version didn't load?
[09.09.21 11:15:44] hammer: does it specify build date?
[09.09.21 11:15:44] angelo: how ?
[09.09.21 11:15:51] angelo: you can see that the module was loaded
[09.09.21 11:16:27] hammer: you have to force the start of the module to load a fresh build
[09.09.21 11:16:37] hammer: like adam can deliver
[09.09.21 11:16:50] angelo: well, i can do it on one bot
[09.09.21 11:16:55] angelo: just need to understand
[09.09.21 11:17:01] angelo: exactly this command on the new module
[09.09.21 11:17:07] hammer: it's not clear why it's so selective. here it is, and here it is not
[09.09.21 11:17:20] angelo: 62 vnc3Dll start
[09.09.21 11:17:28] angelo: there's definitely a modified vnc
[09.09.21 11:17:32] angelo: what did grem contribute
[09.09.21 11:17:56] hammer: is there one botnet on the verified ones?
[09.09.21 11:18:55] angelo: um
[09.09.21 11:18:56] angelo: hmm.
[09.09.21 11:19:04] angelo: you mean the trick, right ?
[09.09.21 11:20:21] hammer: band
[09.09.21 11:21:10] hammer: like jim201tst233
[09.09.21 11:21:19] angelo: aah!
[09.09.21 11:22:10] angelo: one band like
[09.09.21 11:22:13] hammer: there is such a thing, that different botnets have different set of fighting modules
[09.09.21 11:22:19] angelo: hmm
[09.09.21 11:22:23] angelo: let me check it out
[09.09.21 11:22:24] hammer: hmm, that makes no sense at all
[09.09.21 11:23:56] hammer: One browser didn't work at all, maybe it was our fault. Because we unloaded the module and it didn't work at all. And it didn't load anything at all and didn't give an error. Judging by processes msedg was used there.
We will have to take a look at it and see if it works. Maybe AV might be blocking something else.
 Yes chrome was, it was starting but that's all. We unloaded the module but chrome still did not work.
There was such a weird thing, we added a command line in vnc to solve the problem with the injector module. But I didn't see that command line
[09.09.21 11:24:05] hammer: this is from jime
[09.09.21 11:24:25] hammer: " But I didn't see that command line" that's just the ones where it didn't work
[09.09.21 11:24:48] hammer: nowhere at all, or on tests there is, but not on combat?
10:17 AM
I opened the task manager and looked at the command lines in chrome, but alas. Pretty weird. Angelo was looking at the versions, everything seemed to be fresher.
Wasn't only where chrome didn't work
[09.09.21 11:25:07] hammer: I don't know what's wrong yet
[09.09.21 11:25:16] angelo: vntz was fresh according to the logs
[09.09.21 11:25:25] angelo: it was rebooted many times
[09.09.21 11:25:31] angelo: i can give you the bots' ids
[09.09.21 11:25:41] hammer: it's no use. I can't watch them
[09.09.21 11:25:53] hammer: I only have access to the black test one. not the live one
[09.09.21 11:26:07] hammer: I believe you.
[09.09.21 11:26:42] hammer: maybe it's not new chrome? old versions or something
[09.09.21 11:27:56] angelo: yeah, there could be a lot of those
[09.09.21 11:27:56] angelo: good thing
[09.09.21 11:28:04] angelo: these errors are not frequent
[09.09.21 11:28:11] angelo: most of them
[09.09.21 11:31:35] hammer: that's good
[09.09.21 16:58:31] hammer: haven't you done the report yet?
[09.09.21 16:58:46] angelo: repeat
[09.09.21 16:58:48] hammer: you haven't done the report yet?
[09.09.21 16:58:54] angelo: nope.
[09.09.21 16:59:02] angelo: sorry
[09.09.21 16:59:05] hammer: owe me a favor))
[09.09.21 16:59:07] angelo: that's a bummer
[09.09.21 16:59:27] hammer: okay, no worries, I got a lot more unclear situations here
[09.09.21 16:59:28] angelo: I'm on the farm now
[09.09.21 16:59:42] angelo: testing - I hate it
[09.09.21 16:59:45] hammer: not the right weather for farming)
[09.09.21 16:59:52] angelo: =)
[09.09.21 16:59:57] angelo: for AV always weather )
[09.09.21 17:02:26] hammer: ok, but you mark where you record, mark where detected: I record one detec-tion, I look at the second, I mark the third, and the fourth one is spotted
[09.09.21 17:03:18] angelo: yeah, not to sit on the same car, or you could get old
[09.09.21 17:03:23] angelo: and not to make a mistake
[09.09.21 17:03:28] angelo: but they are so laggy!
[09.09.21 17:03:30] angelo: Oh, man!
[09.09.21 17:03:45] hammer: you're telling me?)
[09.09.21 17:04:11] hammer: they are always like this, all years, it never changes, they are eternal like space
[09.09.21 17:04:55] hammer: the sun will go out, the earth will freeze, new stars will go out and be born, the universe will be reborn, and the machines will stay the same, and then it will come to them
[09.09.21 17:05:18] angelo: ahahahaha)))
[09.09.21 17:05:21] angelo: exactly so
[09.09.21 17:05:37] angelo: and it's not working
[09.09.21 17:07:08] hammer: i once got a remote that worked like it wasn't a remote
[09.09.21 17:07:17] hammer: it was a real treat
[09.09.21 17:07:30] angelo: wrote to the admins to put the file into the folder - no response (( I'll have to do it via download
[09.09.21 17:07:45] angelo: I don't believe it happens!
[09.09.21 17:08:29] hammer: what folder? did you make a download, so as not to download through file exchangers to the machine?
[09.09.21 17:08:43] angelo: well, I guess you can
[09.09.21 17:08:46] angelo: ask for it
[09.09.21 17:08:48] angelo: do
[09.09.21 17:08:52] angelo: pour
[09.09.21 17:09:00] angelo: but dogs are silent !!!
[09.09.21 17:09:44] hammer: that's a separate adventure, you can't put it on the machine, go pack it, encrypt it, drool a pencil, write down the link in trembling handwriting, then go to the machine. copy the address, download it, unzip it and enjoy it. if you have to do it only once
[09.09.21 17:10:14] angelo: yeah yeah
[09.09.21 17:10:16] angelo: EVERYTHING
[09.09.21 17:10:21] angelo: I missed you too
[09.09.21 17:10:24] angelo: but gotta go
[09.09.21 17:10:29] angelo: already pulling
[09.09.21 17:10:30] hammer: )
[09.09.21 17:10:54] hammer: success there and patience)
[09.09.21 17:11:04] angelo: thanks
[09.09.21 17:12:26] hammer: The Apostle John the Theologian, St. Theophanes the Hermit, and the Great Martyrs Faith, Hope, Love and their mother Sophia were unofficially appointed as Patrons of the Internet on behalf of the Orthodox Church.
[09.09.21 17:12:36] hammer: on the monitor, on the monitor

[09.09.21 17:13:27] angelo: and on farms one ip ?
[09.09.21 17:13:31] angelo: all of them

[09.09.21 17:13:45] hammer: 162.244.82.215
[09.09.21 17:13:48] hammer: is it?
[09.09.21 17:13:53] angelo: no
[09.09.21 17:13:58] angelo: external IP
[09.09.21 17:14:04] angelo: each car has its own ?
[09.09.21 17:14:15] angelo: well, which one goes to the internet)
[09.09.21 17:14:21] angelo: what else to call it ?
[09.09.21 17:14:22] hammer: no, I guess, but I can't tell
[09.09.21 17:14:29] angelo: okay
[09.09.21 17:14:47] hammer: demetrius knows
[09.09.21 17:16:05] angelo: different
[09.09.21 17:16:07] angelo: looked into it
[10.09.21 09:24:28] hammer: hey, what news does friday bring?

[10.09.21 11:14:16] hammer: says he fixed it, look it up
[10.09.21 11:17:36] angelo: ok
[10.09.21 11:17:47] angelo: there's a problem on another vm
[10.09.21 11:17:49] angelo: with AV
[10.09.21 11:17:54] angelo: I wrote back to Dimke
[10.09.21 11:17:58] angelo: said he would correct
[13.09.21 16:43:34] hammer: how are you?
[13.09.21 16:44:03] hammer: feeling better?
[9/13/21/16:45:17] angelo: 40 again by nightfall.
[13.09.21 16:45:20] angelo: dog.
[13.09.21 16:45:59] angelo: so far the whole spectrum of pleasure
[13.09.21 16:46:52] hammer: when I have a fever, I can't sleep on my back
[13.09.21 16:47:09] hammer: immediately I start having violent helicopters and feeling like I'm falling somewhere
[13.09.21 16:47:32] hammer: i don't know why, only sleep on my belly
[13.09.21 16:48:43] hammer: the spectrum is weakness, brokenness, chills, eye pain and a heavy head?
[13.09.21 16:49:00] hammer: if you can't write, nod twice
[13.09.21 16:55:22] angelo: + nausea
[13.09.21 16:55:39] angelo: and panic when you're 40
[13.09.21 16:56:16] angelo: like on any occasion - aaaaaaaa forgot to do this or that, or who the hell is cooking dinner
[13.09.21 16:56:46] hammer: so maybe an ambulance? They'll give you a shot.
[13.09.21 16:56:54] hammer: if it stays on long enough
[13.09.21 17:04:01] hammer: Let's get you through the night without any trouble, panic or anything else.
[14.09.21 14:14:31] angelo: hi.
[14.09.21 14:14:45] hammer: Hey.
[14.09.21 14:15:10] hammer: while you were gone. garfield tried to start a tinjacket
[14.09.21 14:15:36] hammer: explain to him how to find the exact machine to do it on
[14.09.21 14:15:59] hammer: "we've got something here. we need to unload injectDll and load tinjectDll. I suspect you need to replace the module somewhere "inside" rather than just giving a command
Jaime dumped the ip, but there are a few dozen bots knocking from this ip, in the admin area to which I have access. maybe there is not even through the black admin area all this is done
in general, we need the "help of the room"))"
[14.09.21 14:16:30] hammer: i told him to release the inject and start the tinject, but he needs to know on what machine to do it
[14.09.21 14:17:07] angelo: sec
[14.09.21 14:17:26] angelo: why don't I just do it myself?
[14.09.21 14:17:28] angelo: no ?
[14.09.21 14:17:36] angelo: I'm not going to the hospital
[14.09.21 14:18:34] hammer: easier, sure.)
[14.09.21 14:18:44] hammer: but just in case, show me where to look
[14.09.21 14:18:54] hammer: how are you feeling?
[14.09.21 14:19:15] angelo: i'm texting kot
[14.09.21 14:19:22] angelo: I don't feel so good
[14.09.21 14:19:26] angelo: chicken pox
[14.09.21 14:34:45] hammer: y. It's hard if you didn't get it as a kid
[14.09.21 14:34:55] hammer: cat what?
[14.09.21 14:35:26] angelo: Garfield
[14.09.21 14:35:38] angelo: there was a movie about a orange cat
[14.09.21 14:35:44] angelo: or a cartoon
[14.09.21 14:35:49] angelo: garfield
[14.09.21 14:36:50] angelo: yeah, some kind of chicken pox, I'm not having fun right now
[14.09.21 15:00:39] hammer: Oh, I was thinking of jima, he's got a cat on his avatar.
[14.09.21 15:01:22] hammer: you're lucky, you get it when you're a kid, it's easy, but when you're an adult you're fucked
[14.09.21 15:02:25] hammer: did you bring it from kindergarten?
[14.09.21 15:03:19] angelo: yeah.
[14.09.21 15:03:50] angelo: that's the second time I grabbed game from there
[14.09.21 15:03:58] angelo: this year
[15.09.21 16:13:50] hammer: Hi, how are you feeling?
[15.09.21 16:14:00] angelo: hi )
[15.09.21 16:14:17] angelo: I'm coming around a little bit
[15.09.21 16:14:25] angelo: there's still a draft in my head
[15.09.21 16:14:28] hammer: in the green?)
[15.09.21 16:14:34] angelo: and the bitch is all itchy already

[22.09.21 11:03:00] angelo: well, again, behaves chaotically
[22.09.21 11:03:17] hammer: does it load one and the same page, then not?
[22.09.21 11:03:31] hammer: is it all under the injector, or the same without it?
[22.09.21 11:03:46] angelo: *without vnts did not look
[22.09.21 11:04:07] hammer: look, maybe it's more serious than now
[22.09.21 11:04:11] angelo: I'll load with spambot and check with heimi
[22.09.21 11:04:14] angelo: we're on line
[22.09.21 11:04:17] hammer: if it's not only under Vntz broke
[22.09.21 11:04:28] hammer: okay, I'll go to him again
[9/23/221 15:58:24] hammer: Hey, how's the new build?
[23.09.21 15:58:34] angelo: yeah, it's okay.
[23.09.21 15:58:42] hammer: is it rolling?
[23.09.21 15:58:44] angelo: he's still working on it
[23.09.21 15:58:47] angelo: yeah, i think so
[23.09.21 15:58:53] angelo: but it's not clear either
[23.09.21 15:58:55] hammer: and from the old ones?
[23.09.21 15:59:02] angelo: Def loaded on all machines
[23.09.21 15:59:17] angelo: but there was a bug, I reloaded the module again on a single machine and everything worked
[23.09.21 15:59:45] hammer: that means, after the module started once, you restarted it again
[23.09.21 16:00:01] angelo: yeah
[23.09.21 16:00:05] angelo: and then it worked
[23.09.21 16:00:19] hammer: hmm, what was he missing the first time
[23.09.21 16:00:34] hammer: outside vntz inject works?
[23.09.21 16:00:35] angelo: dunno
[23.09.21 16:00:40] angelo: yes
[9/23/221 16:01:10] hammer: all right, I'm gonna go nag Jaima.)
[24.09.21 11:01:33] hammer: Hey, jime says he solved the problem with the logpost, he doesn't know what's up, but you were involved in the tests
[24.09.21 11:01:49] hammer: caught red-handed, so to speak
[24.09.21 11:01:57] hammer: tell me what happened
[24.09.21 11:12:39] angelo: hi!)
[24.09.21 11:12:39] angelo: uhm
[24.09.21 11:12:39] angelo: mm-hmm.
[24.09.21 11:12:43] angelo: well, we tested it yesterday
[24.09.21 11:12:45] angelo: how did you test it?
[24.09.21 11:12:53] angelo: geez, I ran the module and looked at the logs
[24.09.21 11:13:03] angelo: The server answered
[24.09.21 11:13:11] angelo: now bro
[24.09.21 11:13:15] angelo: I'm kinda busy here
[24.09.21 11:13:24] angelo: about 30 minutes
[24.09.21 11:13:36] angelo: and we'll talk over a bottle of beer.)
[24.09.21 12:18:27] hammer: I'll be gone when I get back
[24.09.21 12:18:36] hammer: Have a nice start on your beer.)
[24.09.21 13:31:00] hammer: Here I am, just a pencil, ready to write down bylina
[24.09.21 13:59:56] angelo: ))
[24.09.21 14:00:01] angelo: what to write
[24.09.21 14:00:14] angelo: yesterday everything started fast and ended fast
[24.09.21 14:00:25] hammer: Write everything as it was
[24.09.21 14:00:30] angelo: but i refuse to write first in the tric group )) wrote and then i was pinned)
[24.09.21 14:00:37] hammer: )
[24.09.21 14:00:45] hammer: initiative is punishable)
[24.09.21 14:01:05] hammer: I have no messages left for yesterday
[24.09.21 14:01:31] hammer: so everything only by word of mouth, i.e. you)
[24.09.21 14:01:37] hammer: speak up
[24.09.21 14:01:53] angelo: checked graber
[24.09.21 14:02:03] angelo: i for my part, ran an inject on the trike
[24.09.21 14:02:10] angelo: with logs
[24.09.21 14:02:13] hammer: logpost?
[24.09.21 14:02:15] angelo: watched the connection to the server
[24.09.21 14:02:26] angelo: so logpost
[24.09.21 14:02:33] angelo: I'm a little slow
[24.09.21 14:02:51] hammer: there was a problem with the inject not giving the logpost to the repository
[24.09.21 14:03:14] hammer: ldime says he checked it. everything is fine, but he wasn't involved, you were.
[24.09.21 14:03:23] hammer: *jayme
[24.09.21 14:03:24] angelo: aah
[24.09.21 14:03:35] hammer: here I come to you
[24.09.21 14:03:36] angelo: that's the right name to pronounce Hymie.)
[24.09.21 14:04:03] hammer: well, how to pronounce it, history is silent)
[24.09.21 14:04:23] angelo: =)
[24.09.21 14:04:25] angelo: i read about that name ))
[24.09.21 14:04:29] angelo: looked at the logs
[24.09.21 14:04:34] angelo: saw the response from the server
[24.09.21 14:05:36] hammer: everything okay there?
[24.09.21 14:05:42] hammer: is it with thomas together?
[24.09.21 14:05:49] angelo: it's dick
[24.09.21 14:05:55] angelo: I was just watching the server response
[24.09.21 14:05:59] hammer: it turns out that the problem is not on the module side
[24.09.21 14:06:09] angelo: no
[24.09.21 14:06:16] hammer: okay, the logpost is fine, but what about the inject under vntz?
[24.09.21 14:06:38] angelo: there's a question what happens to the data on the robber
[24.09.21 14:06:40] angelo: it is not clear
[24.09.21 14:07:03] hammer: so the module returns them?
[24.09.21 14:07:17] angelo: it does
[24.09.21 14:07:21] hammer: they go away.
[24.09.21 14:07:22] angelo: and everything's fine
[24.09.21 14:07:23] hammer: right?
[24.09.21 14:07:27] angelo: yeah
[24.09.21 14:07:47] hammer: what's wrong with them?
[24.09.21 14:07:57] hammer: are they getting to the vault?
[24.09.21 14:09:05] angelo: I guess they do
[24.09.21 14:09:12] angelo: I didn't get it at all
[24.09.21 14:09:17] angelo: I looked at the vault yesterday
[24.09.21 14:09:26] angelo: saw logins and passwords
[24.09.21 14:09:33] angelo: sorry i'm stupid
[24.09.21 14:09:38] angelo: there's a guy sitting here on his knees....
[24.09.21 14:09:42] angelo: me
[24.09.21 14:09:58] angelo: and then they've already started to gobble
[24.09.21 14:10:03] hammer: okay, I took the logpost, all right)
[24.09.21 14:10:03] angelo: in his admin language in the trike group
[24.09.21 14:10:28] angelo: by inject
[24.09.21 14:10:28] hammer: everything okay with injectuk under vntz?
[24.09.21 14:10:35] angelo: last check was positive
[24.09.21 14:10:40] hammer: privasi erroor was cleaned permanently
[24.09.21 14:10:48] angelo: that means the sites that used to be white were opened
[24.09.21 14:10:59] hammer: except for the fact that you started the module twice, there were no other problems?
[24.09.21 14:11:01] angelo: we checked\.
[24.09.21 14:11:05] angelo: uploaded to combat
[24.09.21 14:11:08] angelo: and still no word from the client
[24.09.21 14:11:24] hammer: that's not bad so far, if he's not complaining
[24.09.21 14:11:39] hammer: nothing on injections outside Vnts?
[24.09.21 14:13:04] angelo: he was fine too
[24.09.21 14:13:11] angelo: after upgrade
[24.09.21 14:13:22] hammer: fine
[24.09.21 14:13:29] angelo: I didn't get it with the cookie transfer
[24.09.21 14:13:36] angelo: there is a problem
[24.09.21 14:13:48] angelo: it seems not all or not all of them leak
[24.09.21 14:13:48] hammer: Thomas is doing something with cookies
[24.09.21 14:14:00] angelo: by the way
[24.09.21 14:14:04] hammer: On complaint about cookies and formgrabber data missing. Thomas found the reason.
The problem was with the requests on the servers, not all requests were handled correctly.
Changed the handler. Fixed it partially for now, the rest is in progress.
[24.09.21 14:14:07] angelo: yesterday i ran the bot
[24.09.21 14:14:14] angelo: and I got importdll loaded
[24.09.21 14:14:20] hammer: it's from the report
[24.09.21 14:14:21] angelo: all browsers closed
[24.09.21 14:14:37] angelo: aah
[24.09.21 14:14:44] angelo: so there's a problem on the receiving end
[24.09.21 14:14:47] hammer: he shouldn't touch them
[24.09.21 14:14:51] angelo: I don't understand how it can be broken
[24.09.21 14:14:52] hammer: yeah
[24.09.21 14:15:02] hammer: anything is possible
[24.09.21 14:15:43] hammer: well, I'll write it down by import, we haven't changed the module at all, it shouldn't behave that way
[24.09.21 14:16:03] hammer: on monday i will ask brooks, frank will come out and help me set up
[24.09.21 14:16:25] hammer: what system?
[24.09.21 14:17:22] angelo: 10 64
[24.09.21 14:19:57] hammer: took
[24.09.21 14:20:09] angelo: he sure did
[24.09.21 14:20:17] angelo: both Edge and Chrome and FF
[24.09.21 14:20:30] hammer: double-check
[24.09.21 14:20:47] hammer: and you had all of them open when your module started?
[24.09.21 14:20:57] angelo: yes
[24.09.21 14:21:00] angelo: yeah
[24.09.21 14:21:00] hammer: or you restarted it several times?
[24.09.21 14:21:07] hammer: ok
[24.09.21 14:21:13] angelo: after I closed it, I opened it again
[24.09.21 14:21:16] angelo: and close again
[24.09.21 14:21:19] angelo: one or two
[09.24.21 14:21:21] angelo: then all
[24.09.21 14:21:26] angelo: that is araic
[24.09.21 14:21:35] angelo: he didn't start the module at all
[24.09.21 14:21:40] angelo: but there were many runs
[24.09.21 14:21:52] angelo: anyway, you have to touch it
[24.09.21 14:21:53] hammer: okay, that's bullshit
[24.09.21 14:21:56] hammer: yeah
[24.09.21 14:22:02] hammer: feel it
[24.09.21 14:22:10] angelo: I wasn't paying attention purposefully, I just remembered such behavior
[24.09.21 14:22:16] hammer: haven't touched it for a long time, something is wrong with it
[24.09.21 14:39:33] angelo: judging by Brooks' words, he's complicated
[24.09.21 14:39:44] angelo: they didn't tell you anything about Anchor ?
[24.09.21 14:54:49] hammer: no
[24.09.21 14:59:20] angelo: got it
[24.09.21 14:59:23] angelo: let me ask brooks
[24.09.21 14:59:31] angelo: I think he was redoing it
[24.09.21 14:59:36] angelo: to be undetectable
[24.09.21 15:21:52] hammer: i haven't told brooks about the import yet, i'll tell him on monday not to get upset before the weekend
[24.09.21 15:22:16] angelo: and don't
[24.09.21 15:22:22] angelo: he's finishing the anchor
[24.09.21 15:22:29] angelo: by Mon he said he will
[24.09.21 15:22:36] hammer: fine
[24.09.21 15:22:37] angelo: I'm gonna touch it
[24.09.21 15:22:48] angelo: brought it on yourself]
[24.09.21 15:22:53] hammer: worked with anchor already?
[24.09.21 15:23:06] angelo: mine first
[24.09.21 15:23:07] angelo: )
[24.09.21 15:23:21] hammer: there should be a separate admin area
[24.09.21 15:23:30] angelo: Yeah
[24.09.21 15:23:35] hammer: that's for the machine to pound even if the bot dies
[24.09.21 15:23:46] angelo: anchor even crypto
[24.09.21 15:23:56] angelo: gets in the user's ass
[24.09.21 15:23:56] hammer: usually on corporate networks
[29.09.21 16:48:12] hammer: Hi, do you know admin?
[29.09.21 16:48:19] angelo: salaam in halves !
[29.09.21 16:48:21] angelo: you know
[29.09.21 16:48:28] hammer: what botnets?
[29.09.21 16:50:54] angelo: how to know what kind ?
[29.09.21 16:50:58] angelo: which groups ?
[29.09.21 16:51:27] angelo: Zeus works on the bottom
[29.09.21 16:52:53] hammer: here, I need a bot to knock there
[29.09.21 16:52:57] hammer:
[29.09.21 16:53:06] hammer: do you have one?
[29.09.21 16:53:49] hammer: well, here's the deal, pvpgrabb only gets data from edge
[29.09.21 16:54:23] hammer: you need to run bot to knock on dnog, and run pvgrubb module on it to check how it sends from the other three
[29.09.21 16:54:42] hammer: nicholas is out, he's on vacation, he should be out today or tomorrow
[29.09.21 16:54:54] hammer: and Eugene is absent, who is testing with this module
[29.09.21 16:55:19] angelo: man, you would have loved to run it
[29.09.21 16:55:23] angelo: but I have anchor on test
[29.09.21 16:55:25] hammer: if you have this bot, I can run it on vm, but I can't see the knockout and stuff, no access
[29.09.21 16:55:31] angelo: + you have to run it on farms
[29.09.21 16:55:38] angelo: yeah
[29.09.21 16:55:39] angelo: got it
[29.09.21 16:55:42] hammer: someone else has to start the module and check how it sends
[29.09.21 16:55:44] angelo: I'll find it
[29.09.21 16:56:03] hammer: I'll go poke around the browsers
[29.09.21 16:56:05] angelo: I don't know which bot is knocking where
[29.09.21 16:56:32] hammer: remember, otherwise you'll have to roll back and start over, and on VM it's a bummer, you know it)
[29.09.21 16:57:26] hammer: 4:54 PM
Well, it's supposed to be 2 admins
trike it is.
[29.09.21 16:57:32] hammer: Frank said that
[29.09.21 16:57:44] angelo: Trick is okay
[29.09.21 16:57:59] angelo: but they can knock two admins
[29.09.21 16:58:12] angelo: well, there is a bot - you can try
[29.09.21 17:00:24] hammer: only zeus
on the second admin
all others on auk
[29.09.21 17:00:39] hammer: I'll write to caesar too
[29.09.21 17:03:25] hammer: By the way
[29.09.21 17:03:32] hammer: shut down properly, it's done
4:24 PM
and after reopening were closed again
4:25 PM
if it's open - we can't gather anything, so we close before gathering, and after gathering
[29.09.21 17:03:54] hammer: does it? or i remember it wrong? i think it doesn't touch the open ones, but creates hidden ones and works with them, and they are not visible
forgot everything
4:25 PM
it already does 🙂 we change everything on the fly
[29.09.21 17:04:04] hammer: it is about the import
[29.09.21 17:05:43] angelo: yeah, but he closes all browsers dog
[29.09.21 17:08:12] hammer: that's because he collects from all of them
[29.09.21 17:08:30] hammer: simultaneously
[29.09.21 17:08:43] hammer: i.e. half in order, but at once
[29.09.21 17:09:12] hammer: doesn't wait for user to close the browser to collect from it, that's the shit that happens
[29.09.21 17:09:29] angelo: got it
[29.09.21 17:09:36] angelo: forcibly closes himself and robs them
[29.09.21 17:34:06] hammer: can you take the bot from the cryptopanel?
[29.09.21 17:34:50] angelo: i can
[29.09.21 17:35:01] angelo: man, this anchor is such a bitch !!!!!
[29.09.21 17:35:10] angelo: acting strange and incomprehensible
[29.09.21 17:35:28] hammer: what's wrong with him?
[29.09.21 17:35:34] hammer: is he kicking?
[29.09.21 17:35:48] angelo: yeah, it reacts weird, then it works, then it doesn't
[29.09.21 17:35:57] angelo: that's one of the strange things
[29.09.21 17:36:03] angelo: I thought today I'll do everything
[29.09.21 17:36:05] angelo: But no
[29.09.21 17:36:15] hammer: what's it supposed to do?
[29.09.21 17:36:30] hammer: and by command it spreads to the machines in the network
[29.09.21 17:36:49] hammer: or you use it to see what else is running?
[29.09.21 17:37:00] hammer: open this, start that
[29.09.21 17:37:06] angelo: I'm running test commands
[29.09.21 17:37:11] hammer: okay
[29.09.21 17:37:22] angelo: and then they just go on and off
[29.09.21 17:37:41] angelo: on one machine even the anchor dll wouldn't start
[29.09.21 17:37:47] angelo: he wrote there was no such module
[29.09.21 17:38:09] angelo: even if you point the path directly to it and still no effect - writes error starting dll
[29.09.21 17:38:16] angelo: arararararararararaa
[29.09.21 17:38:25] angelo: I also quit drinking coffee today
[29.09.21 17:38:28] angelo: I'm shaking !
[29.09.21 17:38:48] angelo: I'm on line - I need to hurt the pear
[29.09.21 17:38:56] angelo: I'm right here
[29.09.21 17:39:02] angelo: listen, if they're texting me
[29.09.21 17:39:14] angelo: and run like an 18-year-old girl on a date
[29.09.21 17:40:12] hammer: don't run, let them wait, let them languish in anticipation: "where, where")
[29.09.21 18:09:40] hammer: how do I know now that the bot is running on the machine?
[29.09.21 18:23:54] angelo: well, I don't know.
[29.09.21 18:24:06] angelo: a folder should be created
[29.09.21 18:24:11] angelo: let me see the bot
[29.09.21 18:24:45] hammer: garfield wrote, but if you want, here)  162.244.82.215
tst21
[29.09.21 18:25:39] angelo: can't he look it up ?
[29.09.21 18:25:46] angelo: I'll throw potatoes on the frying pan
[29.09.21 18:26:08] hammer: he looked and threw it where it is)
[29.09.21 18:26:21] hammer: I just immediately asked everyone who will answer)
[29.09.21 18:26:21] angelo: that's right
[29.09.21 18:26:31] angelo: sly ass!)
[29.09.21 18:26:33] angelo: he is

[29.09.21 18:27:06] hammer: it's in the lair)
[29.09.21 19:02:41] angelo: I'll probably be a pig today
[29.09.21 19:02:46] angelo: I'm going to bed early
[29.09.21 19:03:08] hammer: And right
[29.09.21 19:03:21] angelo: i'm tired of sitting up till 12 every day
[29.09.21 19:03:28] hammer: from work wolves can stand, not horses
[29.09.21 19:03:36] angelo: that's it
[30.09.21 10:04:15] hammer: Hey, report back to the General.

[30.09.21 10:25:33] hammer: likes)
[30.09.21 10:26:12] angelo: I like what silver said
[30.09.21 10:26:22] angelo: texted him yesterday and he responded NOTHING
[30.09.21 10:26:31] angelo: LIKE!

[30.09.21 10:28:21] angelo: damn, bro, you're a highly erudite and well-read guy
[30.09.21 10:28:39] angelo: I'm getting a lot of chicks.
[30.09.21 10:28:40] hammer: No, I just picked up some stuff.)
[30.09.21 10:30:07] hammer: well, some, they say I can tell you nice things that you just can't hear
[30.09.21 10:30:12] hammer: but I haven't noticed that)
[30.09.21 10:30:16] hammer: they must be lying
[30.09.21 10:30:47] angelo: you can believe it.)
[30.09.21 10:30:50] angelo: girls like that
[30.09.21 10:32:00] hammer: Frances is gone!
[30.09.21 10:32:09] hammer: here again about the answers
[30.09.21 10:32:22] angelo: what did you expect from him?
[30.09.21 10:32:24] hammer: he asked me, I answered, I expect a reaction, but there's no answer
[30.09.21 10:32:32] angelo: aah!
[30.09.21 10:32:50] angelo: i don't know how you can walk away after seeing what you've been told
[30.09.21 10:32:56] hammer: he is online in toad, I wrote to him in the rocket, and there, and both of them with nothing
[30.09.21 10:33:06] angelo: maybe you have 10 people signed out there
[30.09.21 10:33:32] hammer: At least give me a response
[30.09.21 10:33:37] hammer: + there
[30.09.21 10:33:44] angelo: well, also
[30.09.21 10:34:28] hammer: that's about the absence
[30.09.21 10:34:33] hammer: it's no use if he's online
[30.09.21 10:34:49] angelo: there is such a thing
[30.09.21 10:34:56] angelo: i honestly sat up myself
[30.09.21 10:35:01] angelo: but I realized I don't need it
[30.09.21 10:35:17] angelo: and how to sit online 10 to 24-2
[30.09.21 10:35:27] angelo: that's too much for me
[30.09.21 10:35:28] hammer: It's impossible to sit and stare at the monitor all the time
[30.09.21 10:35:31] angelo: for that salary
[30.09.21 10:35:53] angelo: that's why I started backing out
[30.09.21 10:36:00] angelo: but no longer than 2 hours
[30.09.21 10:36:04] hammer: you can go out, you can eat, you can go out
[30.09.21 10:36:07] hammer: yes, I agree
[30.09.21 10:36:14] hammer: so you don't get lost
[30.09.21 10:36:27] angelo: well, i have tg
[30.09.21 10:36:36] angelo: a couple of guys know him and text me if he's on fire
[30.09.21 10:36:54] angelo: if it's on fire, this contact is very necessary
[30.09.21 10:43:22] hammer: I'll be writing a report today
[30.09.21 10:43:54] angelo: I didn't look anything by injector
[30.09.21 10:43:59] angelo: we are checking Anchor now
[30.09.21 10:44:02] angelo: clients are waiting
[30.09.21 10:44:09] angelo: new build from Brooks
[30.09.21 10:44:13] hammer: don't worry, keep busy
[30.09.21 10:44:36] hammer: heimi also said that since monday we haven't looked at it. it all worked out there
[30.09.21 10:45:15] hammer: then you'll write briefly about the anchor and your thoughts on the injector, what was there and what was not changed
[30.09.21 10:45:45] hammer: yesterday with frank ran pvgrabb module, he had some complaints about nothing in storage again
[30.09.21 10:45:58] hammer: how many times already. and as usual, the module worked
[30.09.21 10:46:16] hammer: got lost somewhere along the way, let them figure it out
[30.09.21 10:48:50] angelo: ok
[30.09.21 10:48:57] angelo: now I'll double-check it
[01.10.21 09:38:25] hammer: hi. what news on this not-so-pleasant friday?
[01.10.21 09:56:14] angelo: why not happy?
[01.10.21 09:56:16] angelo: hi
[01.10.21 09:56:27] angelo: some kind of movement on the grabber
[01.10.21 09:56:31] angelo: anchor is working
[01.10.21 09:56:48] angelo: now it is necessary to check under different conditions what Brooks told to do
[01.10.21 09:57:02] hammer: nothing on grabber yet, I don't see Eugene, but it's still old build
[01.10.21 09:57:16] hammer: at least nicholas is out
[01.10.21 09:57:52] hammer: the problem is not with grabber, it's not coming from him
[01.10.21 09:58:41] angelo: it's not clear
[01.10.21 09:58:51] angelo: there's something in it and on the server
[01.10.21 09:59:21] hammer: checked more than once, it collects. but does not send
[01.10.21 09:59:26] hammer: or can't send
[01.10.21 09:59:31] hammer: or he sends selectively
[01.10.21 09:59:57] hammer: like browser works, but not cookies
[01.10.21 10:00:14] angelo: yeah
[01.10.21 10:00:21] angelo: just like you described
[01.10.21 10:00:26] hammer: this mess has been going on for so long
[01.10.21 10:00:57] hammer: tested with frank, everything went except ee, but ee is a jerk
[01.10.21 10:01:17] hammer: then eugene looks and it doesn't send cookies
[01.10.21 10:01:20] hammer: that's how
[01.10.21 10:01:32] hammer: either it's the bot, or the dpost is bugging me, or the module
[01.10.21 10:02:00] angelo: well, frank seems to understand more or less
[01.10.21 10:02:21] hammer: waiting for him)
[01.10.21 10:04:07] angelo: oh read what silver wrote
[01.10.21 10:04:54] angelo: it doesn't bother me at all, but it sure hurts
[01.10.21 10:05:14] angelo: then I'll make a claim about working time too
[01.10.21 10:05:39] angelo: I will demand 8 hours +1 lunch
[01.10.21 10:09:23] angelo: you can be easily written to by a client at 12 am, no questions asked, but you have a salary at the level of a junior+ who at 18 already put his dick to work and rush home. I do not understand something or we have a strange distribution of the pay grid without a coefficient of harm (and it's huge, especially for admins and prger). Vaughan one already went to rest, and how much he was given a big question, probably ten +.
[01.10.21 10:33:06] angelo: sorry for telling you
[01.10.21 10:33:16] angelo: I also got a little bit
[01.10.21 10:41:26] hammer: I understand you
[01.10.21 10:41:37] hammer: once we had only one tester for everything
[01.10.21 10:43:54] hammer: and now it's time to finish tonight. and there's a new injector coming out, let's test it
[01.10.21 10:44:08] hammer: all cars
[01.10.21 10:44:17] hammer: and the circle of pussy begins
[01.10.21 10:44:21] hammer: *****
[01.10.21 10:44:37] hammer: and you think, "why the fuck didn't I get out five minutes early"
[01.10.21 10:45:20] hammer: although it didn't help) i used to be dragged back to work already gone
[01.10.21 10:45:21] angelo: yeah
[01.10.21 10:45:33] angelo: although sometimes I have enough free time
[01.10.21 10:45:41] angelo: but still bro, still
[01.10.21 10:45:55] angelo: even northerners have extra pay for harmfulness
[01.10.21 10:45:58] angelo: you know what I mean
[01.10.21 10:46:12] hammer: it's no different from one day to the next, there were blockages, and then there was silence
[01.10.21 10:46:32] angelo: when it's quiet.... I'm ashamed to take money from Franz
[01.10.21 10:46:36] angelo: shit!)
[01.10.21 10:46:37] hammer: then they gave me someone to help me, spread out the duties, it became easier
[01.10.21 10:46:55] hammer: and then some more testers
[01.10.21 10:47:22] hammer: and then i started, as you say, to leave by the hour) but that's if i didn't write anything. if i had to, then i stayed
[01.10.21 10:47:29] hammer: so i understand you
[01.10.21 10:47:51] hammer: "when silence.... I'm ashamed to take money from Franz" there is such a thing, as if he didn't deserve it
[01.10.21 10:48:08] angelo: i just have a problem, i'm not from glubinka or small town
[01.10.21 10:48:11] angelo: you know
[01.10.21 10:48:20] angelo: we're not surprised by our salaries here
[01.10.21 10:48:25] angelo: that's my personal problem
[01.10.21 10:48:43] angelo: And half of us here are from small towns
[01.10.21 10:48:52] angelo: for them 100K+ is a lot of money
[01.10.21 10:49:05] angelo: there is such a nuance
[01.10.21 10:49:32] angelo: hopefully something will change in the future
[01.10.21 10:49:50] angelo: I work for the future which cannot be in other spheres
[01.10.21 10:59:09] angelo: i'll tell you, you're a bigger typlid than adam or silver
[01.10.21 10:59:23] angelo: in your functionality and zeal
[01.10.21 11:00:10] hammer: not yet) not while frank won't give me admins, i can do little by myself, but walk and whine)
[01.10.21 11:00:29] angelo: exactly
[01.10.21 11:00:33] angelo: walks and buzzes
[01.10.21 11:00:42] angelo: that's what a typlid must do, every day
[01.10.21 11:01:57] hammer: a typlid should inspire to work feats)
[01.10.21 11:17:45] angelo: that's what you can do, even if you don't know it yourself
[01.10.21 17:10:46] hammer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRhs6ZZAGsA&ab_channel=%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D1%86%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9 этот ролик?
[01.10.21 17:11:17] angelo: yeah ))
[01.10.21 17:13:05] angelo: thanks!)
[01.10.21 17:13:18] hammer: you're welcome)
[01.10.21 17:40:17] hammer: looks like no gingerbread giveaway today
[01.10.21 17:40:25] hammer: only whip this morning
[04.10.21 10:42:23] hammer: Hi.

[04.10.21 10:46:07] angelo: heimi went offline
[04.10.21 10:46:12] angelo: but he can't come in
[04.10.21 10:46:15] angelo: in the rocket
[04.10.21 10:46:43] hammer: nobody knows when he'll come up

[04.10.21 10:47:42] hammer: it would be good
[22.10.21 17:09:27] hammer: Hi.
[29.10.21 14:08:51] hammer: Hi, so is it time to grab the biggest hamank and run to the cash register?
[29.10.21 15:16:12] angelo: grab it, or you won't have time))))
[02.11.21 09:36:47] hammer: Hey, there's some dysmorality at the General.
[02.11.21 09:38:10] hammer: What are you trying to do, create a panic?)
[02.11.21 09:39:17] angelo: hi
[02.11.21 09:39:24] angelo: Benny shouldn't have dropped this.
[02.11.21 09:39:59] angelo: I didn't throw that news
[02.11.21 09:40:12] hammer: why?
[02.11.21 09:40:28] angelo: 60 years I didn't like it
[02.11.21 09:40:36] hammer: )
[02.11.21 09:40:46] hammer: well, it's either 60 or 80)
[02.11.21 09:40:58] hammer: can't get out anyway]
[02.11.21 09:43:55] hammer: otr is killing me, try to turn it on, it won't let me do it from my side
[02.11.21 09:44:27] angelo: that's why I didn't write
[02.11.21 09:44:51] hammer: do you know who it is?
[02.11.21 09:45:20] angelo: didn't know him
[02.11.21 09:45:23] angelo: others were
[02.11.21 09:45:29] hammer: Mm-hmm.
[02.11.21 10:53:55] hammer: you want an essay on the hack band?)
[02.11.21 10:54:08] angelo: come on!)
[02.11.21 10:54:36] hammer: In the half-darkness of the ancient crypt, riddled in the corners by a thick shawl of cobwebs, which swayed slightly as the gentle current of wind stirred the dank and musty air inside, a group of stooped creatures huddled together.
They were pale, with large sunken eyes framed by dark circles, clearly distinguishable against faces that had not seen the sun for a long time, periodically bearded.
Illuminated by the uneven light of thick melted candles, by long bony fingers ending in fingernails, somewhere gnawed, somewhere unevenly trimmed, or even untouched and looking like chipped claws, they handed
each other a photograph of a person in the picture. They crumpled it, sniffed it, and sometimes even tasted it.
"He's capable of anything. That's the kind of man we need. We need..." there was a hysterical, excited whisper that betrayed the euphoria of anticipation of new atrocities.
Somewhere outside, the morning shift garbage truck rumbled, a harbinger of dawn, emptying the bins into its iron belly, and causing the crypt's occupants to wake up as if to pluck them from their sweet reverie. Soon the sun would appear, driving away the night, and that meant it was time to disperse.
One by one, the creatures scattered to their lairs, the last of them locking the crypt door, tugging it for safety, climbing the steps and leaving the basement of the convenience store, where the secret meeting place was located.
I still needed to buy milk, dog food, and coffee. And hurry home to my computer.
[02.11.21 10:55:52] angelo: You've got talent, buddy. !!!!.
[02.11.21 10:56:32] hammer: It wasn't me, it was inspired by "He's capable of anything. That's the kind of man we need," hack group members wrote.
[02.11.21 10:56:41] hammer: from the article)
[02.11.21 10:56:51] hammer: he should have blurted it out.)
[02.11.21 10:57:16] hammer: so I scribbled on motives)
[02.11.21 10:58:53] hammer: caesar is silent( he should have fixed the dll start
[10.11.21 09:11:59] hammer: Hi.

[10.11.21 09:15:21] angelo: I'm taking mine on vacation
[10.11.21 09:15:23] angelo: tired )
[10.11.21 09:15:24] hammer: neither this nor that
[10.11.21 09:15:39] hammer: did you hear the amer came here?
[10.11.21 09:15:44] hammer: last week
[10.11.21 09:15:49] angelo: yeah
[10.11.21 09:15:52] angelo: croupier
[10.11.21 09:15:55] hammer: hackers all over the world
[10.11.21 09:15:56] angelo: dunno what's the result
[10.11.21 09:16:03] angelo: it was
[10.11.21 09:16:08] angelo: we did
[10.11.21 09:16:09] hammer: well, they've got everybody they could
[10.11.21 09:16:26] angelo: our guys can play chess very well
[10.11.21 09:16:30] hammer: they only caught those who were out of the country
[10.11.21 09:16:40] hammer: there was one in barnaul, but they didn't give him out
[10.11.21 09:17:06] hammer: i hope they'll stop there
[10.11.21 09:19:21] hammer: I look there on chat, browser processes went empty, corrected or the adventure continues?
[10.11.21 09:19:41] hammer: what in general was the modules?
[10.11.21 09:20:47] angelo: well, fuck knows.)
[10.11.21 09:20:49] angelo: I'll tell you straight
[10.11.21 09:20:54] angelo: Fixed it or not
[10.11.21 09:20:56] angelo: seems normal already
[10.11.21 09:21:01] angelo: there was a problem with the admin area
[10.11.21 09:21:17] angelo: I don't have time to keep track of everything
[10.11.21 09:21:39] hammer: fine, we'll see
[10.11.21 09:21:52] angelo: fuck you
[10.11.21 09:21:55] angelo: right to the extreme

[10.11.21 09:22:07] hammer: on uk?
[10.11.21 09:22:15] angelo: test run trkkia via shellcode - bots die
[10.11.21 09:22:16] angelo: yeah
[10.11.21 09:22:27] hammer: why?
[10.11.21 09:22:37] hammer: or not registered in task scheduler?
[10.11.21 09:24:28] angelo: i don't know
[10.11.21 09:24:32] angelo: floating bug
[10.11.21 09:24:40] angelo: seems to be referring to traffic problems
[10.11.21 09:24:49] angelo: like different addresses will work differently or not
[10.11.21 09:25:04] hammer: so the bot is installed on the machine?
[10.11.21 09:25:13] hammer: but then it dies
[10.11.21 09:26:08] angelo: yeah
[10.11.21 09:26:14] angelo: 30% alive
[10.11.21 09:26:27] hammer: but not because of the detection?

[10.11.21 09:29:09] hammer: when running as a dll, the task is not always created, respectively, after rebooting or shutting down the machine, when you turn it on again, the bot dies
[10.11.21 09:29:16] hammer: just because there is no start command
[10.11.21 09:29:45] hammer: maybe. like ekse does that too
