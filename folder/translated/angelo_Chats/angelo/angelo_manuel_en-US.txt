[03.08.21 09:34:10] angelo: simple as two fingers
[03.08.21 09:34:21] angelo: pleasing to the eye like mother's face

[03.08.21 09:36:00] angelo: did they really fix the bug in the blockchain or not
[03.08.21 09:36:28] angelo: it sucks they kinda want to switch to Monero for redemption and they may shut the shop down
[03.08.21 09:36:59] manuel: I think they did, but you have to be aware of it.

[03.08.21 09:55:18] angelo: i thought, they pay me to buy hosts + setup, it's not hard, but it eats up time
[03.08.21 09:55:29] angelo: and for tests + xls forgot )
[03.08.21 09:56:06] manuel: Yeah. Routine.
[03.08.21 09:56:37] angelo: sometimes it's even more, 5-6 hours a day minimum for everything

Alright
[03.08.21 10:10:36] angelo: And in general, to continue, I don't know about you. But when a man starts to talk to me like this - GET FASTER, DO NOT STUPID, and so on, I put up with it literally for a short time.
[03.08.21 10:10:47] angelo: this is the scariest thing for me
[03.08.21 10:10:58] angelo: and everything else is just minor stuff

[03.09.21 08:28:20] angelo: Efren was sitting by himself, then he started writing to Stern to give him something

[06.09.21 15:27:43] angelo: if i'm not mistaken

[06.09.21 15:28:15] manuel: That's probably him

[06.09.21 15:30:12] angelo: Ask him
[06.09.21 15:30:31] manuel: Yeah.
[06.09.21 15:30:33] angelo: it's just the fact that they took the guy and he kinda has access to toad/Git/Rocket
[06.09.21 15:30:44] angelo: especially to the git
[06.09.21 15:34:08] manuel: Adam says they're banned

[06.09.21 15:50:54] manuel: I don't understand at all
[06.09.21 16:13:14] angelo: Something to think about
[06.09.21 16:13:29] manuel: Yes.
[06.09.21 16:13:30] angelo: all I know is that coders often neglect security
[06.09.21 16:13:56] manuel: They were. The main thing is not to go abroad with notebook on which worked )
[06.09.21 16:27:52] angelo: or encrypt

[07.09.21 18:24:44] angelo: god - ned is a terrible bore
[07.09.21 18:25:36] manuel: ? Why
[07.09.21 18:26:57] angelo: well, when he talks about his ideas)
[07.09.21 18:26:59] angelo: about crypto
[07.09.21 18:28:23] angelo: we exchange small messages
[07.09.21 18:28:25] angelo: so far we're just people who get 20-30% and quietly walk away.
If hamsters are tame, it's absurd. There may be hamster bots.
but they have no advantage over us - we are bots too
we get the name of the coin in 18 seconds (maybe in my new apartment on a 1Gb network it will be faster, today Iabinense has shown that he actually at such moments works in denial of service)
now consider the first seconds of the pump
the more customers the better for the pump.
The number of buys pushes the price up.
so I call you, and then we will join all who want to earn (or buy their participation, or just make accounts binans (1000 pieces) and it's already a pamp)
[07.09.21 18:30:37] angelo: he is very fanatical
[07.09.21 18:30:39] angelo: and fantastic in places
[07.09.21 18:32:25] manuel: cool! Get me in Naal, too!

[17.09.21 10:37:01] angelo: and me and Jaime already prepared, he wrote the code
[17.09.21 10:37:24] manuel: And what exactly?
[17.09.21 10:37:30] manuel: What kind of code?
[17.09.21 10:37:55] angelo: And you know what they wanted for pretty eyes ? They take the data of the user and automatically put it in the check.

[17.09.21 10:39:33] manuel: no
[17.09.21 10:40:21] angelo: well hz.... I would from 500.... And in general here the question should be divided by the work with the check itself. We're not just drawing a picture, you know.
[17.09.21 10:40:31] manuel: Yeah.
[17.09.21 10:41:09] angelo: but I'll do it anyway, I'll practice on Python with Hymie. Not for a guy, just for myself.

[25.10.21 08:00:25] angelo: I don't mind taking part myself.)
[25.10.21 08:02:15] manuel: Come on, if something for me, will you tell? I also want to be in the theme
[25.10.21 08:02:25] manuel: Can you trust him? He's not going to give us up?
[25.10.21 08:04:45] angelo: well, let's just say he didn't suggest it, but i really want to participate somewhere, and it's better to do it with normal people. Calgon is a man of action and word. It is unlikely to leak. If/when something can burn out - you're the first and only one whom I will tell.
[25.10.21 08:05:33] manuel: I got it, I'm looking forward to it.
[25.10.21 08:10:17] angelo: listen, what can I say, the guy is fanatical, sometimes likes to fantasize and does not deny it, but he is clearly a smart guy in terms of trade and mathematics
[25.10.21 08:10:41] manuel: So in business!
[25.10.21 08:10:51] manuel: I'll ask wilde to add me to it.
[25.10.21 08:13:11] angelo: He'll have something sooner or later
[25.10.21 17:13:36] manuel: Bro here?
[25.10.21 17:29:04] angelo: shit, again nothing was visible (
[25.10.21 17:29:13] angelo: rocket dog
[26.10.21 14:05:00] angelo: here
[26.10.21 14:06:16] angelo: if anything got away
[26.10.21 14:23:24] manuel: Okay.
[26.10.21 15:59:00] manuel: yo bro
[26.10.21 15:59:13] angelo: =)
[26.10.21 15:59:36] manuel: wild
[26.10.21 15:59:44] angelo: yeah
[26.10.21 15:59:45] angelo: thanks
[26.10.21 16:00:01] angelo: not him
[26.10.21 16:00:13] manuel: Did he even order today?
[26.10.21 16:00:30] angelo: duh.
[26.10.21 16:00:35] angelo: Well, they do every day.
[26.10.21 16:00:39] manuel: I must have fucked it up.
[26.10.21 16:00:52] manuel: It's just usually collin does all the work.
[26.10.21 16:01:02] manuel: And now he's gone
[26.10.21 16:01:04] manuel: no
[26.10.21 16:01:23] angelo: Fuck!
[26.10.21 16:01:34] angelo: yesterday voyd took the job for a ride
[26.10.21 16:01:45] angelo: today they have more with uk (
[26.10.21 16:02:00] angelo: any idea what to say other than - we fucked up ?)
[26.10.21 16:02:18] manuel: so did he order?
[26.10.21 16:02:22] manuel: Did he ask for it?
[26.10.21 16:02:29] angelo: I'm looking into it.
[26.10.21 16:03:06] angelo: we're about to find out.
[26.10.21 16:03:14] manuel: Because there is an agreement with collin that only he can command the issue. We once did Zeus and got pussy afterwards
[26.10.21 16:03:35] angelo: even that's how it's arranged
[26.10.21 16:03:57] manuel: Yes. You just need to order in advance and not at the very last moment when the coders are already gone
[26.10.21 16:04:00] angelo: Well, then we won't give a shit
[26.10.21 16:04:19] angelo: I think it's just a misunderstanding
[26.10.21 16:04:28] manuel: clarify whether they ordered it or not
[26.10.21 16:04:32] manuel: if yes, from whom?
[26.10.21 16:04:41] angelo: asked, of course, I'm waiting for an answer
[26.10.21 16:04:59] angelo: hope tenet doesn't give a shit
[26.10.21 16:05:03] manuel: 5 group yes? I'll ask another one
[26.10.21 16:05:11] angelo: 5th yes

[26.10.21 16:08:54] manuel: We can't give out
[26.10.21 16:09:15] angelo: well, obviously you can't say the words - forgot, fucked up, missed and all that
[26.10.21 16:09:35] manuel: You should say it like it is Cactus didn't write on this band
[26.10.21 16:09:57] angelo: (
[26.10.21 16:09:58] angelo: okay.

[26.10.21 16:14:25] angelo: which they load one way
[26.10.21 16:14:45] angelo: but i read that 70% of bots die from AV within 30 minutes without load
[26.10.21 16:15:01] angelo: so i'll do long time test and see how long crypt lives
[26.10.21 16:15:35] angelo: and said to try to use your industrial espionage talents and find out about their last bot they used =)

[28.10.21 08:50:38] manuel: yesterday i bought 50 bucks worth of floki Coin on get.io
[28.10.21 08:50:45] manuel: already doubled today
[28.10.21 08:50:57] manuel: I'm adding another couple hundred, let's see how it goes
[28.10.21 08:51:09] angelo: how do I input and withdraw ?
[28.10.21 08:51:15] angelo: at second-class exchanges
[28.10.21 08:51:25] angelo: i got 700% on shiba it turns out :D

[28.10.21 08:52:39] angelo: I have a friend who makes good money through tokensale
[28.10.21 08:52:46] manuel: there are no accidents ))
[28.10.21 08:52:51] angelo: when a coin is about to go public
[28.10.21 08:52:52] manuel: how does it do?
[28.10.21 08:53:21] angelo: it's like a coin showcase that tells its story and recruits investors and then enters the exchange
[28.10.21 08:53:29] angelo: that is, you can take the minimum
[28.10.21 08:53:48] angelo: he already started his own fund, as a fund, a small investment company, but the guy is not a fool and not a fraud
[28.10.21 08:54:05] manuel: crto! can i participate?
[28.10.21 08:54:11] angelo: i want to chat with him again about this, he went deep into crypto
[28.10.21 08:54:25] angelo: you can) the main thing is to find out what exactly has the potential
[28.10.21 08:56:01] manuel: yeah
[28.10.21 08:56:09] angelo: shit, I'm not used to trade, yesterday at 3 am I was sitting and thinking, to sell or not to sell...
[28.10.21 08:57:00] angelo: i wish i could buy and sell in preorder with 3-5s
[28.10.21 08:57:10] angelo: definitely need to try this theme
[28.10.21 08:57:32] angelo: and why buy floki ?
[28.10.21 08:57:46] manuel: they started pamping it
[28.10.21 08:58:12] manuel: yesterday was advertised in subway and bus stops and it's very cheap like shiba in the beginning
[28.10.21 08:59:47] manuel: I'm thinking about holding a week to do 10 X's
[28.10.21 09:00:02] angelo: even so
[28.10.21 09:00:33] manuel: hopefully )
[28.10.21 09:02:53] manuel: it's a total scam, of course, but they'll take the haip once the shiba pampers
[28.10.21 09:12:05] angelo: you have crypto ads?! ))))

[28.10.21 09:25:35] angelo: reports were created, but backup was not updated
[28.10.21 09:25:55] manuel: that's cruel
[28.10.21 09:26:01] manuel: maybe the backup was fucked up too...
[28.10.21 09:26:33] angelo: dunno, but rocco's avatar is fucking telling the truth
[28.10.21 09:27:29] manuel: yeah
[28.10.21 09:39:13] angelo: nobody can understand anything - looks like they really broke
[28.10.21 09:40:17] manuel: yeah judging by what they write in the group that they went through the folders - the date has changed for today

2) BTC from the payments are not kept on the exchanges, do not withdraw on their cards. Mix in WASABY, translate into monero
3) This chat will be buried today at 02:00 MSK, all go to the new
4) About the material, I promised in early November, but there were some nuances with the botnets, they have already solved, I'm afraid to promise, but I think that on Monday, the material will be poured
5) There will be a new locker, all the old chats who had, we will finish them, access will be today.
There's no panic, no fuck-ups either, just unscheduled procedures.

[10.12.21 08:11:09] angelo: hmm
[10.12.21 08:11:13] manuel: there are stubs for that made
[10.12.21 08:11:37] angelo: yeah i want to know who uses it, who said to do it]
[10.12.21 08:11:48] angelo: yesterday I was chatting with Bezdar and their admin
[10.12.21 08:11:53] angelo: who ran the bot for years
[10.12.21 08:11:58] angelo: and said he heard it for the first time]
[10.12.21 08:12:11] angelo: just want to clarify this nuance
[10.12.21 08:12:11] manuel: Wait, let me go deeper.
[10.12.21 08:12:47] manuel: ``

running the bot:

rundll32.exe bot.dll,DllMain --zzzz="test\bp.dat"

parameter - --zzzz="test\bp.dat" (test\bp.dat can be different)

[10.12.21 08:14:13] angelo: hmm.
[10.12.21 08:14:26] angelo: where did botleo thing come from?)
[10.12.21 08:14:41] manuel: gave out the guy who sap Leo
[10.12.21 08:14:58] angelo: and who/what is leo ? )
[10.12.21 08:15:01] angelo: sorry I'm stupid

[10.12.21 08:16:59] manuel: you can see in the build-machine when you send to cripto what entry points into dll
[10.12.21 08:17:12] angelo: yeah dllmain
[10.12.21 08:17:16] manuel: but the loader is more complicated there. There's a pass-through of 2 entry points and parameters
[10.12.21 08:17:23] angelo: korchoe bro, you just do the crypts and go
[10.12.21 08:17:30] angelo: it's hard to change
[10.12.21 08:17:38] angelo: gotta get used to their shaitan machine
[10.12.21 08:17:51] angelo: I need to understand all the nuances

[10.12.21 08:18:16] angelo: and then I can do it myself, okay?
[10.12.21 08:18:39] angelo: because yesterday I almost shit myself

[10.12.21 08:18:49] manuel: And I did it all day long
[10.12.21 08:19:03] manuel: Now I asked the merchant for crypto

[10.12.21 08:26:31] angelo: I think it was fine.

[10.12.21 08:26:59] manuel: yesterday zeus complained that less than 50% of the output...
[10.12.21 08:27:12] angelo: 6 started for test and 29 GB RAM ran out)
[10.12.21 08:27:22] angelo: not me
[10.12.21 08:27:30] angelo: that's krypto's problem
[10.12.21 08:27:46] angelo: no one told me
[10.12.21 08:30:03] angelo: zeus wants a lot too, just run it roughly, need to trim the corners and it will be fine
[10.12.21 08:30:14] manuel: It's ok!
[10.12.21 08:36:05] manuel: You know what we do. You ask the coder for all the details on the crypts. What and how it works and what and how to crypt.
[10.12.21 08:36:21] manuel: And make just separate stubs for Zeus as an option.
[10.12.21 08:36:27] manuel: If the ones with Leo don't work.

[10.12.21 08:36:46] angelo: you just need to pay attention all the same
[10.12.21 08:37:05] angelo: easy to say ask the coder) but I'll find out
[10.12.21 08:37:47] manuel: ask him how the assemblies work what entry points.
[10.12.21 08:38:44] angelo: I'll ask anything I can
[10.12.21 08:38:52] manuel: )))
[10.12.21 10:34:39] angelo: everything
[10.12.21 10:34:44] angelo: went out to nacoder bot
[10.12.21 10:34:46] angelo: here's just in case
[10.12.21 10:34:49] angelo: just in case
[10.12.21 10:35:05] manuel: Okay.
[10.12.21 10:35:08] manuel: I have info on cryptos:
[10.12.21 10:35:15] angelo: for the lowder in general, it does not matter because it does not ask for his name. i.e. to install and run the bot from it normally.
But the bot itself (after reboot) in case of incorrect operation GetModuleFileName will already glitch update (the loader and botpack itself). And you can also get glitches with instal - it will try to install at every start.
[10.12.21 10:35:28] angelo: no nuances by the booklets, except
1) GetModuleFileName(hModule) dllz should return the real file name on disk, otherwise you might have problems with instal and updates
2) Crpter shouldn't check file CRC (code sections in particular) or bound to TimeSpamp or Crc from PE header, because monitors can change during installation.
[10.12.21 10:35:41] manuel: ``
<merch> bot startup:
rundll32.exe bot.dll,DllMain --zzzz="test\bp.dat"
DllMain - entry point,
--zzzz - parameter
"test\bp.dat" - parameter value


When starting the bot as a DLL, I do the following
1) In EntryPoint.
+ store the hModule.
+ start the thread

2) In the thread itself, I do the following
GetModuleFileNameA(g_hModule, LoaderFileName, MAX_PATH);

Thereby LoaderFileName should refer to the bot file. Then I already use this value in another place and make installation - copying, prescribing in the autorun, etc. And the problem is that GetModuleFileNameA returns either an error or LoaderFileName is empty.
---
1) GetModuleFileName(hModule) dll should return real file name on your drive, otherwise you might have problems with installation and updates
2) Crpter should not check file CRC (in particular code sections) or get linked to TimeSpamp or Crc from PE header, because moni could change during install.
```
[10.12.21 10:35:46] manuel: and by loader:
[10.12.21 10:35:54] manuel: ``
there are no parameters for the loder
they are run by the commands
regsvr32 loader.dll
rundll32 loader.dll,DllRegisterServer
rundll32 loader.dll,DllGetClassObject

where the entry point can be DllRegisterServer or DllGetClassObject
```
[10.12.21 10:36:15] angelo: ok, thanks
[10.12.21 10:36:18] angelo: save
[10.12.21 10:36:32] angelo: whatever, we must have the information
[10.12.21 10:36:38] manuel: yeah
[10.12.21 10:39:03] manuel: ``
<merch> for the loader in general it does not matter because it does not ask its name. i.e. bot install and run from it normally.
But the bot itself (after reboot) if GetModuleFileName does not work correctly already will glitch update (the loader and botpack itself). And also there may be glitches with instal - it will try to install at every start.

init (loader) in EntryPoint stores the specified hModule and then when exported DllMain function is started, it starts a thread in which botpack is started. How to do GetModuleFileNameA(hModule) to tell the botpack the file name. Then botpac uses this file name to check installation and also to restart during update.

```
[10.12.21 10:39:07] manuel: here's another addition
[10.12.21 10:39:15] angelo: yeah
[10.12.21 10:39:22] angelo: exactly what the coder threw me
[10.12.21 10:39:31] manuel: Here.
[10.12.21 10:39:31] angelo: great, we found the source
[10.12.21 10:39:44] manuel: already we'll know what to tell cryptors))
[10.12.21 10:39:45] angelo: sorry, but I like to be overzealous.
[10.12.21 10:39:54] angelo: than not overdoing it.
[10.12.21 10:40:02] angelo: so good for us.)
[10.12.21 10:40:06] manuel: me too! I like to understand everything.
[12/10/21 10:40:09] manuel: Yeah.
[10.12.21 10:41:33] manuel: ``
1) In EntryPoint
+ remembering hModule

2) when the exported DllMain function is called, it starts a thread and waits for it to finish
3) the thread itself does GetModuleFileNameA(g_hModule, LoaderFileName, MAX_PATH);
on the basis of which it already defines its name to install and restart
```
[10.12.21 10:41:35] manuel: and also

[01.02.22 16:47:31] angelo: seems to be the same
[01.02.22 16:47:36] angelo: same error
[01.02.22 16:47:38] manuel: Check please
[01.02.22 16:48:15] angelo: I will try, because bot build is already old
[01.02.22 16:48:26] angelo: we made a new build (add domains to the bot)
[01.02.22 16:48:58] angelo: we caught the error only after an hour
[01.02.22 16:49:04] angelo: that is the main problem
[01.02.22 16:49:13] angelo: bot restarts itself once an hour
[01.02.22 16:49:21] angelo: and on restarting
[01.02.22 16:49:22] manuel: Did it start at all?
[01.02.22 16:49:39] manuel: Did the bot start for the first time?
[01.02.22 16:49:41] angelo: RunDLL
There was a problem starting
The parametr is incorrect
[01.02.22 16:49:47] angelo: running
[01.02.22 16:49:49] angelo: and knocks
[01.02.22 16:49:59] angelo: but can't restart
[01.02.22 16:50:27] manuel: strange
[01.02.22 16:50:32] manuel: You should talk with coder
[01.02.22 16:50:45] manuel: Write in the group
[01.02.22 16:50:52] angelo: Now
[01.02.22 16:50:56] angelo: I already wrote in Toks
[01.02.22 16:51:01] angelo: and discussed with Zhlroy
[01.02.22 16:51:20] manuel: Does your script work fine?
[01.02.22 16:52:30] manuel: Check another crypt bot with 11 tab without detects just workability
[01.02.22 16:52:34] angelo: wait for it (
[01.02.22 16:52:40] manuel: Waiting
[01.02.22 17:17:40] angelo: but definitely not with crypto
[01.02.22 17:18:28] manuel: is your crypt working?
[01.02.22 17:18:42] angelo: I got it working
[01.02.22 17:18:46] angelo: but it's another 40 minutes
[01.02.22 17:18:47] angelo: wait
[01.02.22 17:18:52] manuel: waiting bro
[01.02.22 17:33:51] angelo: did you see ?
[01.02.22 17:33:52] angelo: if directly, i.e. if you tested init.dll file crypt, it means 2 variants:
1) you have an older version, which requires the cryptor to always be able to get the dll file name by hModule
2) You have a newer version and crypt doesn't support gettingModuleFileName(hModule, ...) on the entry point to give you the correct file name
[01.02.22 17:34:18] angelo: the coder writes exactly the crypt
[01.02.22 17:34:42] manuel: what exactly in the crypt to fix?
[01.02.22 17:34:53] manuel: you have a complicated bot))
[01.02.22 17:34:58] manuel: Did you tap the source code?
[01.02.22 17:35:00] angelo: ))))
[01.02.22 17:35:07] angelo: the source is fine with it
[01.02.22 17:35:12] angelo: really not past the hour yet
[01.02.22 17:35:20] manuel: Waiting for his bounce
[01.02.22 17:35:29] angelo: I do GetModuleFileNameA(hModule, ...) at DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH in DLL EntryPoint
Then I don't use hModule anywhere else, so the main thing is that in this place GetModuleFileNameA returns the correct dll name
Otherwise updates to the bot will not work. If you start without loader, then also the install will not work.
[01.02.22 17:35:30] manuel: To put 100 on crypt
[01.02.22 17:35:32] angelo: there writes
[01.02.22 17:35:41] angelo: well, the question is
[01.02.22 17:35:46] angelo: there is essentially nothing else
[01.02.22 17:35:57] angelo: nothing really
[01.02.22 17:36:15] angelo: the domain/PSS system is fine there
[01.02.22 17:36:24] angelo: and bot build was not changed in any way, it's the same
[01.02.22 17:36:38] manuel: Otherwise bot updates will not work. If it starts without loader, then also install will not work.
[01.02.22 17:37:50] angelo: shorter, crypto has a sin
[01.02.22 17:37:59] angelo: nothing else to blame
[01.02.22 17:38:39] manuel: Not a fact bro things happen
[01.02.22 17:38:45] manuel: Waiting for clean bounce

[01.02.22 17:53:50] angelo: no errors bro
[01.02.22 17:55:11] manuel: ok
[01.02.22 17:55:20] manuel: now you have to tell cryptor where he should look?
[01.02.22 17:55:25] manuel: Purely on the bot? Lowder ok?
[01.02.22 17:55:32] angelo: lowers ok
[01.02.22 17:55:42] angelo: where to look Code wrote this
[01.02.22 17:55:44] manuel: What exactly is not working in the bot
[01.02.22 17:55:51] angelo: I do GetModuleFileNameA(hModule, ...) in DLL in EntryPoint at DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH
Then I don't use hModule anywhere else, so the main thing is that in this place GetModuleFileNameA returns the correct dll name
Otherwise updates to the bot will not work. If you start without loader, then also the install will not work.
[01.02.22 17:56:06] angelo: bot can not start itself, writes startup error
[01.02.22 17:56:29] angelo: that's exactly what we're talking about
[01.02.22 17:57:00] angelo: just wait
[01.02.22 17:57:06] angelo: make new build
[01.02.22 17:57:37] manuel: Do other stubs work?
[01.02.22 17:57:43] manuel: 11 for example everything was ok with it?
[01.02.22 17:58:02] angelo: ah, I don't know, until it was time to restart the bot
[01.02.22 17:58:11] angelo: cryptors know what I'm talking about
[01.02.22 17:58:17] manuel: Ideally he should also be tested without detects
[01.02.22 17:58:26] manuel: crypt and wait how he behaves with the bot
[01.02.22 17:59:29] angelo: 11 is already on my test

8:44 AM.
Yep.
Still the same problem with the key client, Zeus. All of his stubs are dirty this morning. Did a good job yesterday. Stubs were clean. We need clean stubs every day in the morning. Ideally, a separate cryptor, or a separate priority task for cryptors to clean stubs for Zeus.
He has the highest turnover of crypts.
8:51 AM
Have you written to Orval with this question?
8:56 AM
Yes
8:59 AM
What did he reply?
Did he highlight it?
9:00 AM
No.
He didn't highlight.
9:02 AM.
Write to Franz about needing a dedicated cryptor. I got a very interesting response from Franz on this subject.
9:03 AM
What's the answer?
9:08 AM.
Franz:

I made my suggestions there, I'm waiting to hear what they say.
i suggested to put it all in a separate structure, let them pay for themselves at least partially, because it's crazy to spend 50-100k bucks every month on something no one really uses
crypto eche costs 30 bucks, it's a fucking 100, and the point is to keep 10 cryptors on payroll, testers, farm and build machine


If there is no one to choose from 10 cryptors, then it is time to allocate everyone to other tasks.
This is all that is realistic right now.
I can allocate two people to Zeus' tasks, but they will only be his tasks, and no others. People aren't pulling their weight.
To make it work we need more cryptors, at least 10 more people.
Not everyone is good at it, but everyone is good at something.
A question for consideration in general about cryptors ...
9:10 AM
Every day they take not 1 crypto but 20-30-100 cryptos
By Zeus.
9:11 AM.
He pays 3k bucks a day for cryptos?
9:11 AM.
I don't know. About his boards.
In addition to Zevsa there are other pintsters who make cobes lockers shellcodes
