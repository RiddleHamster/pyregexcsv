[07.09.21 15:25:39] angelo: hi
[07.09.21 15:25:40] angelo: look
[07.09.21 15:25:42] angelo: IDEX
[07.09.21 15:25:50] angelo: Oh, shit!
[07.09.21 15:25:55] ned: bullshit IDEX
[07.09.21 15:26:00] ned: the whole market is fucked
[07.09.21 15:26:16] ned: i didn't buy the idex for 28 at 3 o'clock at night
[07.09.21 15:26:26] angelo: bullshit not bullshit but a week ago it was 0.05
[07.09.21 15:26:34] ned: i lost 140 bucks
[07.09.21 15:26:45] ned: jumped from 900 to 760
[07.09.21 15:26:50] ned: last 10 min
[07.09.21 15:26:58] angelo: yeah, he's jumping hard
[07.09.21 15:27:04] ned: you didn't ask for nothing
[07.09.21 15:27:11] ned: about X
[07.09.21 15:27:20] ned: but you shouldn't have talked to me yesterday
[07.09.21 15:27:34] angelo: yeah, sick
[07.09.21 15:27:38] angelo: there was no time to talk
[07.09.21 15:27:47] ned: okay then
[07.09.21 15:27:47] angelo: 3 days of garden !
[07.09.21 15:27:49] angelo: 3 days after summer
[07.09.21 15:27:50] ned: and now?
[07.09.21 15:28:01] angelo: I feel like that, but I have to live
[07.09.21 15:28:05] ned: on topic. especially important now
[07.09.21 15:28:42] ned: now it's clear you can't guess anything
[07.09.21 15:28:52] ned: my computer crashes at this exchange
[07.09.21 15:29:09] ned: the app flickers and fills the screen and the CPU
[07.09.21 15:29:29] ned: so i'm getting more and more convinced of my line
[07.09.21 15:29:32] angelo: why ?
[07.09.21 15:29:37] angelo: api glitch ?
[07.09.21 15:29:42] ned: yes
[07.09.21 15:29:43] angelo: or it's a software problem
[07.09.21 15:29:46] ned: everything is glitchy
[07.09.21 15:29:48] ned: t
[07.09.21 15:29:54] ned: the same on my phone
[07.09.21 15:30:00] angelo: yeah
[07.09.21 15:30:04] ned: they sure have
[07.09.21 15:30:07] angelo: now I feel the glitches and lags
[07.09.21 15:30:10] ned: I think everyone can see it too
[07.09.21 15:30:30] ned: I watched the whole epic about dollars running faster than seconds
[07.09.21 15:30:31] angelo: at such spikes, there must be a terrible load on your servers
[07.09.21 15:30:48] ned: That's the point
[07.09.21 15:31:21] ned: i bet slp 10.50 i thought it would never get there, but it jumped to 8
[07.09.21 15:31:33] ned: and ate my 1000 bucks
[07.09.21 15:31:45] angelo: you tell me when you'll have pluses ?
[07.09.21 15:31:52] ned: it's 9yu63
[07.09.21 15:31:56] angelo: you are my stability litmus paper )
[07.09.21 15:31:59] ned: I already have
[07.09.21 15:32:03] ned: sure
[07.09.21 15:32:10] ned: but only you are ready to listen?
[07.09.21 15:32:28] ned: to know our bright path
[07.09.21 15:32:43] ned: all this mess is just a confirmation of how things should be done
[07.09.21 15:33:05] angelo: wait
[07.09.21 15:33:07] angelo: here's an example
[07.09.21 15:33:10] angelo: violent pamp
[07.09.21 15:33:11] angelo: was
[07.09.21 15:33:14] angelo: with IDEX
[07.09.21 15:33:48] ned: but they're obviously not people
[07.09.21 15:33:49] ned: ROBOTS
[07.09.21 15:33:56] angelo: was it possible to predict that from the data from the trades ?
[07.09.21 15:34:07] ned: with idex - FORBIDDEN
[07.09.21 15:34:18] ned: we'll do that too
[07.09.21 15:34:19] ned: but later
[07.09.21 15:34:37] ned: there's $2 bucks in it (maybe 1.5)
[07.09.21 15:34:49] ned: 1.37 exactly.
[07.09.21 15:34:55] ned: Listen.
[07.09.21 15:35:05] ned: it's been two days of this
[07.09.21 15:35:08] ned: he was nobody
[07.09.21 15:35:08] angelo: obviously not students or poor chinese
[07.09.21 15:35:15] ned: but it was warmed up in time
[07.09.21 15:35:23] ned: at first it was cheap to do
[07.09.21 15:35:33] ned: and then the hungry greedy masses got involved
[07.09.21 15:37:43] angelo: i hate to see it, it hurts, because one hundred percent somebody was not a whale
[07.09.21 15:38:05] ned: you got it!
[07.09.21 15:38:19] ned: I asked the kid now (he's in the kitchen going nuts)
[07.09.21 15:38:23] ned: who are we?
[07.09.21 15:38:30] ned: he says - Fools
[07.09.21 15:38:40] ned: I say you're the sucker
[07.09.21 15:38:44] ned: who else are we
[07.09.21 15:38:47] ned: he says
[07.09.21 15:38:56] ned: pampers
[07.09.21 15:38:57] ned: I say no
[07.09.21 15:39:06] ned: what were we talking about this morning?
[07.09.21 15:39:12] ned: now we must become whales
[07.09.21 15:39:17] ned: you ready?
[07.09.21 15:39:22] ned: i'll tell you how
[07.09.21 15:39:45] ned: are you ready? - I was asking you.
[07.09.21 15:40:07] ned: the kid's ready, I told him this morning
[07.09.21 15:40:26] angelo: to become whales?)
[07.09.21 15:40:31] ned: sure.
[07.09.21 15:40:34] ned: telling
[07.09.21 15:40:50] ned: tell me what drives the price?
[07.09.21 15:41:17] ned: for example, idex was lying around since the listing.
[07.09.21 15:42:03] ned: it occurred to me that pamps can be organized, not just participated
[07.09.21 15:42:26] ned: I go to the pampas in the TV channel
[07.09.21 15:42:38] ned: the same channel can be organized no problem
[07.09.21 15:43:12] ned: then - if I can guarantee you a profit, you're ready to take part in the pampa (someone else's so far)
[07.09.21 15:43:40] ned: in it we come on 18 seconds, sit till 30 and leave with 20-30% profit
[07.09.21 15:43:58] ned: in one month it could double deposit
[07.09.21 15:44:15] angelo: now bro, sorry, not ignoring - the client is on line
[07.09.21 15:44:19] angelo: fuck my brain
[07.09.21 15:44:30] ned: hurry up to me
[07.09.21 15:44:33] ned: {\a6}I need to see you
[07.09.21 15:44:37] ned: eednik
[07.09.21 15:44:50] ned: it's after hours-no client
[07.09.21 15:46:10] ned: slp already 10
[07.09.21 15:46:25] ned: soon to be 10.50
[07.09.21 15:56:00] ned: went to walk the dog, I'll be 40 min later
[07.09.21 15:58:16] angelo: come on
[07.09.21 16:38:04] ned: free?
[07.09.21 18:15:50] angelo: free for now
[07.09.21 18:16:00] angelo: payments take a long time
[07.09.21 18:16:02] angelo: It's a pain in the ass
[07.09.21 18:16:11] angelo: I have time
[07.09.21 18:16:16] angelo: 10-11 to 12-1
[07.09.21 18:16:19] ned: are you getting paid?
[07.09.21 18:16:30] angelo: i'm getting paid
[07.09.21 18:16:38] angelo: they pay me money, and there's bones
[07.09.21 18:16:55] angelo: tester's salary is very modest
[07.09.21 18:16:57] angelo: we have
[07.09.21 18:17:12] ned: okay, everything in the house. I'm talking about money too.
[07.09.21 18:17:29] angelo: but clients are usually fucked up
[07.09.21 18:17:35] angelo: and very fucked up.
[07.09.21 18:17:41] angelo: and not everyone has money
[07.09.21 18:17:44] ned: let me ask simple questions. And you give simple answers.
[07.09.21 18:17:52] ned: Let's raise your salary.
[07.09.21 18:18:25] ned: Because I see you can't see where I'm going with this.
[07.09.21 18:18:34] angelo: honestly not much bro
[07.09.21 18:18:41] angelo: I remember
[07.09.21 18:18:50] angelo: you're trying to predict explosive growth
[07.09.21 18:19:00] angelo: by purchasing analysis
[07.09.21 18:19:09] ned: this is research. And it doesn't concern you. It concerns me.
[07.09.21 18:19:45] ned: you and I will talk about real things. it is impossible to predict the idex because it is the operation of certain people.
[07.09.21 18:20:24] ned: if it were possible, you and I would not be talking now, but just scalping and investing at your pleasure.
[07.09.21 18:20:47] ned: and as it is we are being sheared at someone else's pleasure. It's a bitter constant. That's not what I mean.
[07.09.21 18:21:01] ned: I'm talking about pumps again.
[07.09.21 18:21:16] ned: Explosive growth is guaranteed there.
[07.09.21 18:21:49] ned: The whales are counting on it. They're counting on hamsters coming in to provide that explosive growth.
[07.09.21 18:22:13] ned: you don't have to play that.
[07.09.21 18:22:25] angelo: but then what is the method to raise ?
[07.09.21 18:22:25] ned: I'm not going to.
[07.09.21 18:22:28] angelo: if not by that
[07.09.21 18:22:46] ned: I will be the one who will research how to raise.
[07.09.21 18:22:47] angelo: well if we are not talking to be a hamster
[07.09.21 18:22:52] angelo: they are in their mass
[07.09.21 18:23:17] ned: while we are just people who get 20-30% and quietly go away.
[07.09.21 18:24:02] ned: If hamsters are tame, this is absurd. There may be hamsters-bots.
[07.09.21 18:24:17] ned: but they have no advantage over us - we are bots too
[07.09.21 18:25:43] ned: we get the name of the coin in 18 seconds (maybe on my new 1Gb network apartment it will be faster, today I've shown that it works in denial of service at all at such moments)
[07.09.21 18:25:55] ned: now let's look at the first seconds of the ramp
[07.09.21 18:26:06] ned: the more customers the better for pump
[07.09.21 18:26:18] ned: more buys push the price up
[07.09.21 18:27:21] ned: so I call you, and then we will join all those who want to earn (or buy their participation, or just make up binans accounts (1000 pieces) and it is already a pamp).
[07.09.21 18:27:45] angelo: hm
[07.09.21 18:27:53] ned: with so many accounts, you can sell any coin by yourself (but I'll look into it, not about this now)
[07.09.21 18:28:04] angelo: and if
[07.09.21 18:28:43] ned: forget about the number - now you don't need to call anyone and it will be a pamp. it's being set up by alien scammers
[07.09.21 18:29:03] angelo: i don't understand %
[07.09.21 18:29:18] angelo: 20-30 is a certain figure?!
[07.09.21 18:29:20] ned: I have a son, wife, grandfather, grandmother, and lots of friends I can help financially
[07.09.21 18:29:27] angelo: does it make any sense ?
[07.09.21 18:29:29] angelo: miscalculation ?
[07.09.21 18:29:43] ned: sure - certain
[07.09.21 18:29:44] ned: taken from the analysis of all pams this year
[07.09.21 18:30:04] angelo: there, I would help my dad, the guy is 65 years old......
[07.09.21 18:30:07] ned: calculation while averaging all pamps (in real case)
[07.09.21 18:30:43] ned: pampers report that they have 100-150%
[07.09.21 18:30:48] ned: I am modest and leave early but with profit and never with a loss
[07.09.21 18:31:01] ned: here you go
[07.09.21 18:31:03] ned: the folder
[07.09.21 18:31:59] ned: and the price at the pamp goes up ALWAYS
[07.09.21 18:32:10] angelo: that makes sense
[07.09.21 18:32:12] ned: and if you buy it early, you won't have a SELLOUT
[07.09.21 18:32:13] angelo: I understand
[07.09.21 18:32:23] angelo: that's the whole point
[07.09.21 18:32:27] angelo: buy early
[07.09.21 18:32:43] ned: let's look into it
[07.09.21 18:32:43] ned: why early
[07.09.21 18:32:55] ned: information about the pamp appears in the only way in the TV channel
[07.09.21 18:33:35] angelo: are you sure their channel is working the pamp?
[07.09.21 18:33:46] ned: in the first microsecond, as soon as the information appears, my filter picks it up and immediately makes an order to buy at the market of the declared coin-BINGO
[07.09.21 18:34:14] ned: this channel is advertised by cheaters, it has 800K subscribers
[07.09.21 18:34:19] angelo: I don't understand how they do it
[07.09.21 18:34:25] ned: there is no other way to announce about pampa
[07.09.21 18:34:42] angelo: they roughly speaking, they can create it themselves
[07.09.21 18:34:49] ned: what are they doing that you don't understand?
[07.09.21 18:35:01] ned: they are primitives and we can do the same
[07.09.21 18:35:19] ned: who do you make it?
[07.09.21 18:35:27] angelo: make a fuss
[07.09.21 18:35:36] angelo: spread rumors
[07.09.21 18:35:51] angelo: to sell a coin as a pre-pump one, thus to create a pamp itself
[07.09.21 18:35:58] ned: they do. They choose the coin. At first they just collect $3.5K from especially greedy and gullible people and give them the name of the coin
[07.09.21 18:36:23] ned: they buy it, and the hell with them because it does not raise the price as the coin is dead
[07.09.21 18:36:42] angelo: we do not take into account the collusion with the moneybags
[07.09.21 18:36:43] ned: they're not selling the coin
[07.09.21 18:36:46] angelo: shit!
[07.09.21 18:36:48] ned: they keep her name a secret
[07.09.21 18:36:50] angelo: I want the same channel )
[07.09.21 18:37:01] ned: pay and get it
[07.09.21 18:37:08] ned: use it
[07.09.21 18:37:18] ned: we can make such a channel
[07.09.21 18:37:43] ned: start a TV channel
[07.09.21 18:37:53] ned: give a signal to the channels with hamsters they will gather and make a stir
[07.09.21 18:38:06] angelo: Yes, I've seen such channels, there are a lot of them
[07.09.21 18:38:14] angelo: then they knock themselves out like crazy
[07.09.21 18:38:15] angelo: to the cart
[07.09.21 18:38:16] ned: it's not about creation
[07.09.21 18:38:32] angelo: and i'll tell you what? it all works perfectly on greed and blind faith
[07.09.21 18:38:37] angelo: yeah, got it.
[07.09.21 18:38:45] ned: and about the uses and rationales for participating in this business
[07.09.21 18:38:51] ned: that's it!
[07.09.21 18:39:01] ned: 2 or 3 of these pamps a month
[07.09.21 18:39:19] ned: you bet any amount, and it is guaranteed to build up
[07.09.21 18:40:00] ned: the amount is on deposit in Binance, I have a server that will buy from your account and then sell
[07.09.21 18:40:00] angelo: 2-3 per month, 20-30 guaranteed
[07.09.21 18:40:05] angelo: sounds good )
[07.09.21 18:40:44] ned: i can make you click one letter on the "tv" channel and it will sell the whole purchase at that moment because i filter the "tv" channel
[07.09.21 18:41:12] ned: or we sell the fuck out 10 seconds after purchase
[07.09.21 18:41:26] ned: and let the others fight for extra profit
[07.09.21 18:41:50] ned: imagine that
[07.09.21 18:42:18] angelo: sorry I'm not good at trading
[07.09.21 18:42:23] ned: you sit with your cell phone and use your PC to watch the price going up (it's impossible! It's too fast)
[07.09.21 18:42:52] ned: but to sell you only need to send a sell signal to the channel, for example the letter S
[07.09.21 18:43:05] angelo: convenient
[07.09.21 18:43:09] ned: there's nothing to trade here
[07.09.21 18:43:12] angelo: if your api is stable of course
[07.09.21 18:43:16] ned: just take profit
[07.09.21 18:43:23] ned: like water from the well
[07.09.21 18:43:43] ned: that's the right question
[07.09.21 18:43:44] ned: API works the same for everyone
[07.09.21 18:43:48] angelo: and when do you think to try it out ?
[07.09.21 18:43:51] ned: so we are on equal footing
[07.09.21 18:43:52] angelo: or already?
[07.09.21 18:44:07] ned: I have everything ready - I'm waiting for the date of the Pampa
[07.09.21 18:44:17] ned: of course I will
[07.09.21 18:44:26] ned: I'll report back to you
[07.09.21 18:44:47] ned: I'll make a multi-order for my son, father-in-law's wife and mother-in-law
[07.09.21 18:44:58] ned: got it?
[07.09.21 18:45:10] angelo: Mm-hmm.
[07.09.21 18:45:13] angelo: I do
[07.09.21 18:45:23] ned: people will flock to the positive news and improve our odds
[07.09.21 18:45:44] ned: the more participants the higher the price
[07.09.21 18:45:56] ned: you're right
[07.09.21 18:46:01] ned: we're at the beginning
[07.09.21 18:46:10] ned: but argue the point, it's a project
[07.09.21 18:46:21] ned: I'm just finishing up the renovation
[07.09.21 18:46:38] angelo: do it yourself?
[07.09.21 18:46:51] angelo: yes, we have to hurry before they close it down
[07.09.21 18:46:57] ned: i'm moving into an apartment, i can set any number of internet channels with any speed (even faster than my computer)
[07.09.21 18:46:58] angelo: and if they close it, you can't be a fortune teller
[07.09.21 18:47:05] ned: they won't
[07.09.21 18:47:09] angelo: what's the move about?
[07.09.21 18:47:13] ned: i was relieved to tell you
[07.09.21 18:47:43] ned: the fbi was developing this topic in america (i read it)
[07.09.21 18:47:44] ned: it's already from 2017 and it's not dying
[07.09.21 18:47:47] ned: it's all normal.
[07.09.21 18:47:50] ned: no cheating
[07.09.21 18:47:57] ned: people participate voluntarily
[07.09.21 18:48:10] ned: bots are legal too and everyone knows they exist
[07.09.21 18:48:22] ned: look I was looking at the strait today
[07.09.21 18:48:43] ned: all the coins are all the same
[07.09.21 18:48:45] ned: the bit by 10 percent and all the others by 15-20
[07.09.21 18:49:25] ned: even dead coins which were not traded (I have such DATA SLP IQ)
[07.09.21 18:49:43] ned: all like crazy started selling
[07.09.21 18:49:44] ned: they are BOTH
[07.09.21 18:49:45] angelo: why is it like this?
[07.09.21 18:49:49] angelo: aaaah
[07.09.21 18:49:52] angelo: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[07.09.21 18:49:59] angelo: that's it
[07.09.21 18:50:05] ned: because we're IT people my friend
[07.09.21 18:50:09] angelo: I was sitting there wondering why the dead went down
[07.09.21 18:50:11] ned: What do you want?
[07.09.21 18:50:19] angelo: work out config
[07.09.21 18:50:43] ned: some coins at a certain hour start working out the strategy
[07.09.21 18:50:44] ned: every day
[07.09.21 18:50:48] ned: I'm gonna learn it
[07.09.21 18:50:51] ned: but that's not what this is about
[07.09.21 18:51:04] ned: if there are no pamps, then you know what?
[07.09.21 18:51:43] angelo: what? what could it be?

[07.09.21 18:51:53] ned: LISTINGS
[07.09.21 18:51:53] angelo: aah!)
[07.09.21 18:52:05] ned: from 3 to 6 per month
[07.09.21 18:52:09] angelo: dumb, sore throat
[07.09.21 18:52:14] ned: I saw how they passed
[07.09.21 18:52:21] ned: there are up to six X's
[07.09.21 18:52:32] ned: we'll work them out too
[07.09.21 18:52:36] ned: the situation is different there
[07.09.21 18:52:47] ned: nobody knows when the listing will happen except binans
[07.09.21 18:52:58] ned: they get thousands of projects for listing
[07.09.21 18:53:13] ned: they already selected 460+ coins which are traded
[07.09.21 18:53:18] angelo: listings are worse than pampas, most people lose there
[07.09.21 18:53:24] ned: and every month they add a few coins
[07.09.21 18:53:39] ned: and we will make money!
[07.09.21 18:54:13] ned: they secretly appoint a day and publish this information in TELEGA 30 min-1 hour before that day
[07.09.21 18:54:45] angelo: we have to try it
[07.09.21 18:54:51] angelo: test so to speak
[07.09.21 18:55:05] angelo: I am of course naked conditionally speaking
[07.09.21 18:55:07] angelo: but still
[07.09.21 18:55:54] ned: in this message they say that in the next full hour there will be a listing for this coin.
the coin is not yet available for trading.
it will appear exactly at 9:00 a.m. mosaic filter from binansa is waiting for messages on this coin and makes order in the first second!
[07.09.21 18:56:19] ned: mosoy = mosoy
[07.09.21 18:56:33] ned: my filter
[07.09.21 18:56:42] angelo: and how do they get into preorder ?
[07.09.21 18:56:46] angelo: is it possible ?
[07.09.21 18:56:47] ned: all these elements I have worked out in the long run
[07.09.21 18:57:11] ned: you can be anywhere you want and the bot will double your money forever
[07.09.21 18:57:21] ned: we don't care about the preorder
[07.09.21 18:57:35] ned: listing is a public announcement of bids to all
[07.09.21 18:57:41] ned: and the start of bidding
[07.09.21 18:57:51] ned: even the price is not known at the beginning
[07.09.21 18:57:58] ned: but we buy at the market
[07.09.21 18:58:41] ned: you can go through the listings in the binance app and you'll see that they're all X.  But they only last a minute.
[07.09.21 18:59:03] ned: half a minute rise, then fall, then fluctuate, then the coin dies
[07.09.21 18:59:34] ned: we don't participate in any preorders
[07.09.21 18:59:39] ned: it's called lonchings
[07.09.21 18:59:50] angelo: yes
[07.09.21 18:59:54] ned: this is bullshit where you get millions of coins for free
[07.09.21 18:59:57] angelo: how long to write the bot ?
[07.09.21 19:00:07] ned: or for 500 bucks to buy something differently?
[07.09.21 19:00:25] ned: and then they go to sell these coins on the day of listing on binance
[07.09.21 19:00:41] ned: and we also go there to buy early and sell fast
[07.09.21 19:00:48] ned: I already wrote
[07.09.21 19:01:21] ned: stage three
[07.09.21 19:01:28] ned: that's when the money is up to eopa
[07.09.21 19:01:33] ned: nothing to do
[07.09.21 19:01:49] ned: I will learn the principles of price movements and the signs of the rockets.
[07.09.21 19:02:00] ned: e.g., the terrible feathering of pro-trading.
[07.09.21 19:02:21] ned: today I traded $1.40 billion on the idex.
[07.09.21 19:02:23] angelo: I want to try it, even with 100 bucks
[07.09.21 19:02:33] ned: And this flow shows what to buy.
[07.09.21 19:02:35] ned: Right away
[07.09.21 19:02:39] angelo: I'm supposed to get lucky sometime
[07.09.21 19:02:49] ned: such a flow from the beginning is to move the price
[07.09.21 19:03:17] ned: I can also raise the price once. But no one will notice it.
[07.09.21 19:03:48] ned: And for everyone to readjust, it needs a flow of purchases and I see it in the binan filter in my API
[07.09.21 19:04:05] ned: no luck here, there is a sober calculation
[07.09.21 19:04:15] ned: I've been thinking about it for a year
[07.09.21 19:04:29] ned: and now there is a perfect simple scheme and product
[07.09.21 19:04:37] ned: exactly one year by the way
[07.09.21 19:05:01] ned: then i registered on binance in february and lost 3.5 bucks in may
[07.09.21 19:05:44] ned: i'll try it without you. i'll show you my deposit and you'll send me your pips
[07.09.21 19:06:03] ned: by the way, I can (have thoughts) do trade directly from the cart
[07.09.21 19:06:19] ned: for example, write the name of the coin and the amount of trade
[07.09.21 19:06:31] ned: and it immediately makes a trade
[07.09.21 19:06:41] ned: then you also sell
[07.09.21 19:07:12] ned: i can give you the balance by the cart
[07.09.21 19:07:17] ned: keep income
[07.09.21 19:07:20] ned: reports
[07.09.21 19:07:23] angelo: if teams
[07.09.21 19:07:27] ned: it is in the future
[07.09.21 19:07:28] angelo: they will work fast
[07.09.21 19:07:36] angelo: it probably makes sense even by cart
[07.09.21 19:07:41] angelo: that's probably more productive
[07.09.21 19:07:51] angelo: I'm for trying and trying)
[07.09.21 19:08:08] angelo: 3.5 is sad
[07.09.21 19:08:11] angelo: very sad
[07.09.21 19:08:15] angelo: all my savings
[07.09.21 19:08:16] ned: just to test the technology
[07.09.21 19:08:43] ned: bullshit 3.5 I went for it deliberately
[07.09.21 19:08:56] ned: the idex is going up today - why am I not buying?
[07.09.21 19:09:14] ned: then the bitcoin drops and I don't sell?
[07.09.21 19:09:25] ned: but you can do it all in one click.
[07.09.21 19:09:29] ned: or automatic
[07.09.21 19:09:37] ned: like stoploops
[07.09.21 19:09:50] ned: and the same buy requests
[07.09.21 19:10:16] ned: you can do it without reserving busses. just set an inequality and they may be more than you have coins.
[07.09.21 19:10:25] ned: first triggered will buy
[07.09.21 19:11:01] ned: and so I put the order and that's it - the money goes into the order and waits. And in the meantime, another coin dropped and you could buy it, etc.
[07.09.21 19:11:19] ned: you can do a lot
[07.09.21 19:11:20] angelo: you got to put it all into action
[07.09.21 19:11:30] ned: no way
[07.09.21 19:11:37] ned: no business here, only money
[07.09.21 19:12:13] ned: go look at the coins, see what I threw down last time
[07.09.21 19:12:26] ned: this is august, the most crypto winter

[07.09.21 19:19:17] ned: it's a shame now - tomorrow there might be a listing
[07.09.21 19:19:41] ned: but it doesn't matter, I'll run binnance and take pictures of the traffic
[07.09.21 19:19:56] ned: when and how the coin comes
[07.09.21 19:20:02] ned: what is the pace of bidding
[07.09.21 19:20:07] ned: when to fix
[07.09.21 19:20:28] ned: it's important, so I don't have any regrets about the money
[07.09.21 19:21:06] ned: I also have a mother from china coming for the second computer

[07.09.21 19:22:12] ned: that's the trade bro
[07.09.21 19:22:17] angelo: you're really serious
[07.09.21 19:22:26] angelo: yeah, it's not a trade!)
[07.09.21 19:22:36] ned: what to do. I have a kid to raise. My wife is greedy.
[07.09.21 19:22:44] angelo: shit, same thing.
[07.09.21 19:22:52] ned: animals
[07.09.21 19:22:59] angelo: we have kindergartens at 40K a month, from 40K
[07.09.21 19:23:01] angelo: That's bullshit
[07.09.21 19:23:07] ned: not a wife and kid, but real dogs, cats, fish
[07.09.21 19:23:08] angelo: I need money badly
[07.09.21 19:23:13] angelo: ahahahahahahaha
[07.09.21 19:23:20] angelo: funny footnote)
[07.09.21 19:23:25] ned: that's the money I drew you where it is
[07.09.21 19:23:34] ned: Give me moral support and it'll be fun
[07.09.21 19:24:06] angelo: you got all the cards you need
[07.09.21 19:24:13] ned: let's play!
[07.09.21 19:24:14] angelo: it's a sin not to
[07.09.21 19:24:19] angelo: GREAT!
[07.09.21 19:24:20] ned: or else
[07.09.21 19:24:44] ned: thanks for understanding my idea and I think you supported it
[07.09.21 19:24:58] angelo: no, the idea is really cool
[07.09.21 19:25:02] ned: note that Binans is a GIANT.
[07.09.21 19:25:10] ned: the whole world has already written such bots.
[07.09.21 19:25:16] ned: but ours is no worse
[07.09.21 19:25:29] ned: we will fight
[07.09.21 19:25:29] angelo: we have to do it!
[07.09.21 19:25:33] ned: but not hand to hand
[07.09.21 19:25:51] angelo: no
[07.09.21 19:25:54] angelo: you have to use your head
[07.09.21 19:26:09] ned: are you in the ural or where?
[07.09.21 19:26:10] angelo: I have a head
[07.09.21 19:26:12] angelo: you do)
[07.09.21 19:26:15] angelo: no
[07.09.21 19:26:18] angelo: in the center
[07.09.21 19:26:20] ned: in moscow7
[07.09.21 19:26:26] angelo: about
[07.09.21 19:26:36] ned: okay.
[07.09.21 19:26:41] ned: whatever
[07.09.21 19:27:45] ned: well, I've exhausted the subpoena. now I'll build binary filter. I need to analyze the listing.
[07.09.21 19:27:58] ned: i used to do it only with pumps.
[07.09.21 19:28:20] ned: I can send you traffic, see what chances hamsters have. but they still come.
[07.09.21 19:28:49] angelo: i'd like you to send it to me and if it's not hard to describe how you draw a conclusion
[07.09.21 19:28:58] angelo: honestly, I don't want to rack my brain to understand
[07.09.21 19:29:10] ned: what is withdrawal?
[07.09.21 19:29:22] angelo: no
[07.09.21 19:29:24] angelo: that's the withdrawal
[07.09.21 19:29:29] angelo: that's it
[07.09.21 19:29:33] angelo: we're out of steam
[07.09.21 19:29:42] angelo: `I can send you traffic, you'll see that hamsters have no chance. but they still come.
[07.09.21 19:29:42] ned: it's easy to watch. you can see the price and volume of trades grow by the second.
[07.09.21 19:30:04] ned: it's bullshit when you watch it from the Binance app
[07.09.21 19:30:07] ned: it's a matter of seconds
[07.09.21 19:30:20] ned: it's impossible to look here and there, much less make decisions
[07.09.21 19:30:30] ned: that's why the machine will do everything for us
[07.09.21 19:30:46] ned: and the basis that in the first seconds the price goes up, and then it goes down
[07.09.21 19:30:57] ned: but the first seconds are enough for us
[07.09.21 19:31:41] ned: well, and a little Russian roulette might fall lower than we would like to make profit, but never into a loss
[07.09.21 19:32:04] ned: well, maybe sell at our price and then the price will suddenly go up
[07.09.21 19:32:15] ned: this is the lost profit and greed
[07.09.21 19:32:25] ned: the main thing is to always increase deposit
[07.09.21 19:32:52] angelo: come on, let's make some money !
[07.09.21 19:32:56] ned: super profits to attract hamsters
[07.09.21 19:33:34] ned: we need Mao. And to get the masses, we will buy in tens of thousands of dollars at the first moment and move the price up faster.
[07.09.21 19:34:08] ned: the more pressure at the beginning of the rush, the higher it will go
[07.09.21 19:34:32] ned: the faster it rises, we get out early, the bigger the profit
[07.09.21 19:34:50] ned: but not less than 20-30% see all pamps by myself
[07.09.21 19:35:19] angelo: Anyway, I'm not getting off the subject

[08.09.21 15:15:26] ned: Binance is going up
[08.09.21 15:15:28] angelo: where is the time like next morning
[08.09.21 15:16:00] ned: and bitcoin is up 2%
[06.01.22 16:41:52] ned: hello! partner!
[06.01.22 16:41:56] ned: how is it in the new year?
[06.01.22 16:42:00] ned: better?
[06.01.22 16:42:23] ned: how are you?
[06.01.22 17:07:10] angelo: Hi!
[06.01.22 17:07:20] angelo: Quiet and calm like in a nursing home (
[06.01.22 17:07:21] ned: how's the bit?
[06.01.22 17:07:31] angelo: well, as you can see )
[06.01.22 17:07:50] ned: i got $1000 down 10% that day
[06.01.22 17:08:10] angelo: I'm used to it.
[06.01.22 17:08:10] ned: but I made 2 bucks on futures!
[06.01.22 17:08:17] angelo: my heart stopped beating
[06.01.22 17:08:47] angelo: I lost 1700 in Monero
[06.01.22 17:08:54] angelo: but I don't get out of it
[06.01.22 17:08:58] ned: now I use cautious strategy and tactics
[06.01.22 17:09:07] ned: do not go into deals right away
[06.01.22 17:09:12] ned: only the most reliable
[06.01.22 17:09:29] ned: how much to liquidation? or you spot?
[06.01.22 17:09:34] angelo: and i just accumulate part of my salary in xmr
[06.01.22 17:09:53] ned: you need to get into futures
[06.01.22 17:09:53] angelo: i don't even know what to tell you ) i'm just saving in monero
[06.01.22 17:10:14] ned: every day there are super possibilities
[06.01.22 17:10:21] ned: I had 8 liquidations already
[06.01.22 17:10:23] angelo: when I reach a large amount of more or less 20K+, then I will think
[06.01.22 17:10:42] ned: and now how much have you reached?
[06.01.22 17:10:48] angelo: 6
[06.01.22 17:10:58] ned: you're a real capitalist
[06.01.22 17:11:13] ned: I would have shorted that amount by x50
[06.01.22 17:11:13] angelo: life taught me to save
[06.01.22 17:11:26] ned: it is guaranteed!
[06.01.22 17:11:39] ned: a coin from above can only fall down on ascites
[06.01.22 17:12:16] angelo: i dont know what i will do, the brain says to find somewhere to put 4-5K zelen and wait
[06.01.22 17:12:21] ned: and all this is your fortune in monero?
[06.01.22 17:12:41] angelo: yeah, i used to throw dirt there
[06.01.22 17:12:49] angelo: changed dirty bits in monero and cleaned it that way
[06.01.22 17:12:50] ned: did it grow back like that?
[06.01.22 17:12:56] angelo: and then started storing stupid
[06.01.22 17:12:57] ned: what was the max rise and fall?
[06.01.22 17:13:07] angelo: no, I was just down)
[06.01.22 17:13:16] angelo: at the top was 500 bucks
[06.01.22 17:13:19] angelo: now 200
[06.01.22 17:13:22] ned: and where did 6K come from?
[06.01.22 17:13:27] angelo: from WP
[06.01.22 17:13:37] ned: you saved up for a year?
[06.01.22 17:13:45] angelo: less
[06.01.22 17:13:57] angelo: from salary
[06.01.22 17:14:01] ned: well done.
[06.01.22 17:14:03] ned: success
[06.01.22 17:14:06] ned: and monero growth
[06.01.22 17:14:12] ned: now I'll be rooting for her
[06.01.22 17:14:17] angelo: just a monero is comfortable to wash the dirt
[06.01.22 17:14:22] ned: I thought slp would grow
[06.01.22 17:14:33] ned: there was 600 bucks buried at 17 too
[06.01.22 17:14:39] ned: and now it's bitching at 2
[06.01.22 17:14:45] angelo: uuuuh
[06.01.22 17:14:45] ned: but I sold it a long time ago
[06.01.22 17:14:47] angelo: ptz
[06.01.22 17:14:58] ned: when I had a liquidation I discounted everything by 300
[06.01.22 17:15:16] angelo: i know i can't trade
[06.01.22 17:15:18] angelo: either longs
[06.01.22 17:15:27] angelo: or something risky and super profitable
[06.01.22 17:15:28] ned: anything is possible at futures
[06.01.22 17:15:35] ned: if only not liquidation!
[06.01.22 17:15:48] ned: there are shorts and longs at the same time
[06.01.22 17:15:54] ned: shorts goes up
[06.01.22 17:15:55] angelo: ouch, I've heard about futures, you can get good and lose there
[06.01.22 17:16:00] ned: going short
[06.01.22 17:16:08] ned: bad only when the corridor changes
[06.01.22 17:16:22] ned: or it goes up (I don't know when it comes back)
[06.01.22 17:16:25] ned: or down
[06.01.22 17:20:02] angelo: when are you going to get rich?
[06.01.22 17:20:15] ned: so already
[06.01.22 17:20:22] ned: 2 bucks earned today.
[06.01.22 17:20:43] ned: I got 25 in the depo there
[06.01.22 17:20:44] angelo: )))) then I'm a millionaire with this approach!
[06.01.22 17:20:53] ned: no hurry
[06.01.22 17:21:06] angelo: or you'll make it in time]
[06.01.22 17:21:17] ned: I'll turn on Tric2 and BK at full speed
[06.01.22 17:21:23] ned: and I'll build my super program
[06.01.22 17:21:26] ned: I'm all set
[06.01.22 17:21:40] ned: API all checked, GUI all ready
[06.01.22 17:21:44] ned: there are strategies
[06.01.22 17:21:49] ned: everything is on the go
[06.01.22 17:21:56] ned: only one puzzle to put together
[06.01.22 17:22:16] ned: by the way, did I tell you my sperm trading idea?
[06.01.22 17:22:31] ned: last
[06.01.22 17:22:33] angelo: I don't remember already
[06.01.22 17:22:36] angelo: nope
[06.01.22 17:22:43] ned: so you didn't
[06.01.22 17:22:48] ned: because it's the last one
[06.01.22 17:22:51] ned: look
[06.01.22 17:22:59] ned: you said yourself you're not a futures peter
[06.01.22 17:23:17] ned: I'm sitting there round the clock and I get X's every day
[06.01.22 17:23:33] ned: and then liquidation and I'm starting over again
[06.01.22 17:23:43] ned: as you see very successful trading
[06.01.22 17:23:53] angelo: man, I need to roll 10K a couple times
[06.01.22 17:24:06] ned: well
[06.01.22 17:24:30] ned: I'm making my interface (essentially a trading terminal)
[06.01.22 17:24:49] ned: it will be like I told you, nothing is canceled and pamps, listings and arbitrage everything
[06.01.22 17:24:55] ned: \but also futures!
[06.01.22 17:25:23] ned: all the tools help me know the good coins to trade when they enter the entry position
[06.01.22 17:25:40] ned: out of 120 coins I will always get two three coins at any time
[06.01.22 17:26:01] ned: i choose manually and make a bet and after a couple of minutes i make 40% from the deposit
[06.01.22 17:26:03] ned: always
[06.01.22 17:26:14] ned: it would seem yes, I do
[06.01.22 17:26:19] angelo: and you made a cut of how much you do per month?
[06.01.22 17:26:21] ned: and where is angelo?
[06.01.22 17:26:27] angelo: )))
[06.01.22 17:26:27] ned: every day
[06.01.22 17:26:37] angelo: per month, what money do you have?
[06.01.22 17:26:43] ned: I catch diquids because I'm in any second
[06.01.22 17:26:45] angelo: 1K -5K-10K ?
[06.01.22 17:26:57] ned: today is the first day I made two trades and did not enter
[06.01.22 17:27:10] ned: and even more I made a bid and the price did not reach it
[06.01.22 17:27:24] ned: i got fucking 25 bucks in wabank
[06.01.22 17:27:28] ned: it was 23 in the morning
[06.01.22 17:27:46] ned: I'm on the cross rate
[06.01.22 17:27:50] ned: nah50
[06.01.22 17:28:06] ned: that's why I catch volatility at the microproportion of coin run
[06.01.22 17:28:18] ned: if I catch spills, it is x400
[06.01.22 17:28:31] ned: even if it goes by 8%
[06.01.22 17:28:35] angelo: you have to make large sums if everything runs like clockwork!
[06.01.22 17:29:19] ned: if for example a coin goes up and it is on futures, it will fall by 150% to 30%, even with waves.
[06.01.22 17:29:46] ned: for me it is 80% difference but multiplied by x50 it is 400%
[06.01.22 17:29:54] ned: that is real x4
[06.01.22 17:30:07] ned: so I want to overclock 20
[06.01.22 17:30:14] angelo: why are you trading in small amounts?
[06.01.22 17:30:16] ned: i already increased 10 bucks to 300 bucks
[06.01.22 17:30:25] ned: but then I got liquidation
[06.01.22 17:30:27] angelo: I noticed if you poker a couple thousand
[06.01.22 17:30:28] ned: learning
[06.01.22 17:30:34] angelo: or a couple hundred
[06.01.22 17:30:44] angelo: your behavior is very different
[06.01.22 17:30:50] angelo: very different
[06.01.22 17:30:50] ned: whatever deposit
[06.01.22 17:31:02] angelo: i remember when i traded 5K bucks, he was so brain dead.
[06.01.22 17:31:04] ned: I work with percentages when I bet
[06.01.22 17:31:14] ned: always 10-20% at most
[06.01.22 17:31:22] ned: depending on the risk
[06.01.22 17:31:32] ned: if there is no risk I can put 75%
[06.01.22 17:31:45] ned: otherwise I would have immediate liquidation
[06.01.22 17:31:54] ned: so listen
[06.01.22 17:32:06] ned: let's assume I became a successful trader
[06.01.22 17:32:09] ned: what then?
[06.01.22 17:32:30] ned: the old scheme is still in effect ) but this is a bonus
[06.01.22 17:32:37] ned: i am 100% successful trader
[06.01.22 17:32:45] ned: because I am careful and calculating
[06.01.22 17:32:54] ned: what's it to you?
[06.01.22 17:33:34] angelo: love to watch others' success!
[06.01.22 17:33:38] ned: no
[06.01.22 17:33:39] angelo: i will be happy for you !
[06.01.22 17:33:42] ned: wrong answer
[06.01.22 17:33:48] angelo: honestly and even sincerely
[06.01.22 17:33:54] ned: i can copy my successful trades!
[06.01.22 17:34:44] ned: you can send the same commands to your account
[06.01.22 17:34:54] ned: and how much for me and for you
[06.01.22 17:35:06] ned: if I trade 10 bucks, I get 2 bucks
[06.01.22 17:35:16] ned: and if you have 10K lying, you will get 2000
[06.01.22 17:35:26] ned: something like this
[06.01.22 17:35:33] angelo: I got 500 with 1500 already there ( at banana
[06.01.22 17:35:43] ned: I already signed all my son's wife and friends
[06.01.22 17:35:58] angelo: you are good !
[06.01.22 17:36:06] ned: and so every day and many times
[06.01.22 17:36:13] angelo: and not stale account ?
[06.01.22 17:36:13] ned: this is the strength and the difference from pamps
[06.01.22 17:36:20] angelo: when implementing api
[06.01.22 17:36:20] ned: there only 4 times a month
[06.01.22 17:36:32] ned: what's he doing?
[06.01.22 17:36:39] ned: now there are only robots on Binance
[06.01.22 17:36:41] ned: no fools
[06.01.22 17:36:46] angelo: well, login/soap
[06.01.22 17:36:56] ned: I got half of my liquidations because of interface errors
[06.01.22 17:37:12] ned: I don't need it
[06.01.22 17:37:20] ned: only need key
[06.01.22 17:37:23] ned: public
[06.01.22 17:37:34] ned: that's what Binance gives you
[06.01.22 17:37:50] angelo: I'll take care of it tonight, I'll look into binans
[06.01.22 17:37:53] ned: there are commercial and free bots
[06.01.22 17:38:00] angelo: it makes me sad to look there lately (
[06.01.22 17:38:11] ned: you just change the angle
[06.01.22 17:38:32] ned: if you look at the water pump to keep growing it's one thing
[06.01.22 17:38:39] ned: it's called investor
[06.01.22 17:38:46] ned: its task is to be discouraged and wait
[06.01.22 17:38:55] ned: but if on the pendulum or water pump
[06.01.22 17:39:08] ned: you can make a shitload of cash at every price change
[06.01.22 17:39:16] ned: you need to find an experienced trader
[06.01.22 17:39:17] angelo: a shitload!
[06.01.22 17:39:20] ned: I am a trader
[06.01.22 17:39:20] angelo: you need it bad
[06.01.22 17:39:41] ned: I lost a lot already
[06.01.22 17:39:55] ned: trader armed with automation tools
[06.01.22 17:39:59] angelo: how much ? )
[06.01.22 17:40:06] angelo: i blew a 30K euro broker once
[06.01.22 17:40:18] ned: 6K and 100 bucks lost profit
[06.01.22 17:40:24] ned: when I bet on the wrong side
[06.01.22 17:40:24] angelo: but not in trading, but in investing
[06.01.22 17:40:42] ned: when investing I lost nothing, I despise it
[06.01.22 17:41:11] ned: investing is when you buy on the spot and wait forever
[06.01.22 17:41:19] ned: I don't like it
[06.01.22 17:41:44] ned: but that's how you can guess
[06.01.22 17:42:01] ned: to make it a million times bigger than bitcoin since 2009
[06.01.22 17:42:15] ned: but every day you can raise it easily and with interest
[06.01.22 17:42:27] ned: because trading is a fascinating game of cat and mouse
[06.01.22 17:42:40] angelo: if nerves are normal, yes]
[06.01.22 17:42:54] ned: just one difference when a game is hunted and another when they bring it to you on the range and you hit it on the fly
[06.01.22 17:43:03] ned: my nerves are fine
[06.01.22 17:43:16] angelo: you know, i didn't have a hard time going from 500 to 1700. And like everything was on heat, and then the money flew away, and so I started to get nervous scolding myself...
[06.01.22 17:43:20] angelo: I do not
[06.01.22 17:43:25] ned: I used to go down to -800 bucks and went up from liquidation on the last buck
[06.01.22 17:43:27] angelo: very no, nervous bastard
[06.01.22 17:43:50] ned: you had success in the bull market
[06.01.22 17:43:57] ned: it happens to everybody
[06.01.22 17:44:16] ned: bull market turns into a bear market
[06.01.22 17:44:50] angelo: sorry bro, I got work to do
[06.01.22 17:44:53] angelo: i'm here but in places
[06.01.22 17:44:53] ned: when all bets are off and everything's up joyfully and pleasantly
[06.01.22 17:44:56] ned: but it never happens
[06.01.22 17:45:00] ned: you are the one being led
[06.01.22 17:45:02] angelo: yeah
[06.01.22 17:45:08] ned: they're taking you down
[06.01.22 17:45:13] angelo: which can never be happy and farthing
[06.01.22 17:45:14] ned: you are given by birea for a while
[06.01.22 17:45:27] ned: your blood money is magnetized to them and then you sink it
[06.01.22 17:46:34] ned: or you invest and then take the coin down
[06.01.22 17:46:38] ned: same thing
[06.01.22 17:46:50] ned: you gave them your hard cash for free interest and you wait
[06.01.22 17:46:58] ned: graying surge
[06.01.22 17:47:09] ned: then you add more of your own, and they drop again
[06.01.22 17:47:35] ned: all your stamps are made on a computer and all your accounts are controlled by bmrg algorithms
[06.01.22 17:48:35] ned: but you can always make a profit on a short run
[06.01.22 17:48:49] ned: or on a guaranteed interval
[06.01.22 17:48:57] ned: there is a concept of trading from levels
[06.01.22 17:49:14] ned: all when the price goes from one level to another to the exact point
[06.01.22 17:50:25] ned: so glad you're awake, will be even more awake. I have a development.
[06.01.22 17:53:55] angelo: you're not backing down, commendable. I have no backgrounder and I'm a man of pity, not of cold calculations unfortunately to make a trade (.
[06.01.22 17:54:22] ned: when we are together we are a force
[06.01.22 17:54:40] ned: when we are together
[06.01.22 17:54:53] ned: the main thing is to persist in the right direction
[06.01.22 17:55:11] ned: if you're so lyrical that's good too
[06.01.22 17:55:18] ned: skeptics are good analysts
[06.01.22 17:55:33] ned: when you say wow it means fucking good
[06.01.22 17:56:01] ned: these cryptos and bits are like grapes
[06.01.22 17:56:11] ned: and people are like a fox who can't reach it
[06.01.22 17:56:20] ned: I'm building a ladder
[06.01.22 17:56:38] ned: counting only on the power of programming and brain
[06.01.22 17:56:49] ned: I check the steps with my money
[06.01.22 17:56:57] ned: by checks
[06.01.22 17:57:27] ned: if there was no overtone window I would have shorted it long ago
[06.01.22 17:57:36] ned: why bother with something you're not good at?
[06.01.22 17:57:49] ned: that's why I should go in with something I know
[06.01.22 17:57:53] ned: I am an expert in prog
[06.01.22 17:59:47] angelo: i have no right to fuck up, i'm a little pussy g. the next step in my life is to multiply
[06.01.22 17:59:53] ned: all my software works
[06.01.22 17:59:56] angelo: you should try your best with multiplying
[06.01.22 18:00:11] angelo: head !
[06.01.22 18:00:17] ned: to waste is a necessary step
[06.01.22 18:00:20] angelo: look api
[06.01.22 18:00:23] angelo: how to do
[06.01.22 18:00:28] ned: easy
[06.01.22 18:00:32] angelo: but the key will not betray the account ?
[06.01.22 18:00:36] ned: go in and they give it to you
[06.01.22 18:00:39] ned: even two
[06.01.22 18:00:45] ned: private and public
[06.01.22 18:01:04] ned: they are only for trading
[06.01.22 18:01:04] angelo: i know sending the money your soap is not glowing, only the beginning and end of the soap
[06.01.22 18:01:12] ned: there may be restrictions on functions
[06.01.22 18:01:15] ned: on ipi
[06.01.22 18:01:25] ned: I'm about to get a static IP
[06.01.22 18:01:29] ned: you can limit
[06.01.22 18:01:52] ned: no yaks sent anywhere
[06.01.22 18:01:59] ned: no soap
[06.01.22 18:02:24] ned: if you have a binan account, they'll scan you with KYC technology
[06.01.22 18:02:30] ned: know your customer
[06.01.22 18:02:40] ned: like drug screening
[06.01.22 18:02:48] ned: it's actually the cia and the fsb
[06.01.22 18:02:58] ned: but nevertheless you leak everything there yourself
[06.01.22 18:03:22] ned: otherwise the account will be blocked (afraid, all would then go to exchanges without kyc)
[06.01.22 18:03:40] ned: all you need for automatic trading is detached from you
[06.01.22 18:03:48] ned: it's just a password crypto
[06.01.22 18:04:03] ned: private and public keys
[06.01.22 18:04:47] ned: my binans require proof of address
[06.01.22 18:05:01] ned: I already sent them all the documents up to the rental contract
[06.01.22 18:05:04] ned: they say not that
[06.01.22 18:05:12] ned: prove you live at this address
[06.01.22 18:05:28] ned: but they do all the bidding and give money to deposit and withdraw
[06.01.22 18:05:49] ned: What can they do? They make a huge profit on my commission
[06.01.22 18:07:23] ned: I'm going vabank on crypto
[06.01.22 18:07:32] ned: only there you can achieve something
