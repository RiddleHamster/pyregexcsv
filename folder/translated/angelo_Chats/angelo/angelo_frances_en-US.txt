[28.07.21 10:12:46] frances: You need to understand why and what is the problem
[28.07.21 10:13:34] frances: weldon deals with it, not brooks
[28.07.21 10:15:35] angelo: oh, didn't eugene test it ?

[28.07.21 18:53:23] angelo: tell me, why so many closed on DEF?
[28.07.21 18:53:34] angelo: why can't you delegate some functions
[28.07.21 18:53:56] angelo: well, let's say he loads configs for the inject on it
[28.07.21 18:54:05] angelo: superbrowser access on it

[24.08.21 17:57:44] angelo: that's why I'm interested
[24.08.21 17:58:12] angelo: it's not the district officer who's asking ))
[24.08.21 18:00:33] frances: we have everything, they already know
[24.08.21 18:00:45] frances: Conti is our software
[24.08.21 18:01:07] angelo: got it, just in case I say something wrong
[24.08.21 18:01:11] frances: I guess it's not just Zeus who is behind these scripts...

[25.08.21 07:36:48] angelo: limp....
[25.08.21 07:36:58] angelo: you have to wait a long time for the solution of his problems
[25.08.21 07:37:02] frances: hi
[25.08.21 07:37:10] frances: what's wrong with it?
[25.08.21 07:37:22] angelo: one or the other.
[25.08.21 07:37:34] angelo: frances tries to solve problems in his competence
[25.08.21 07:37:42] angelo: but VNC itself stopped working yesterday
[25.08.21 07:37:53] angelo: the client wrote in the group about it
[25.08.21 07:38:02] angelo: and silence
[25.08.21 07:38:31] frances: Got it. Thanks.
[25.08.21 07:40:18] angelo: IF I can write you if I see a stagnation in the work of this or that project? just don't point the finger at me
[25.08.21 07:42:15] frances: that's what you do
[25.08.21 07:42:28] frances: there's no movement
[25.08.21 07:42:34] frances: There's a lot of people
[25.08.21 07:42:44] frances: And the little things keep getting stretched until you tell them
[25.08.21 07:42:51] frances: already got the server and the necessary accounts
[25.08.21 07:43:01] frances: and so constantly, fuck me up(
[25.08.21 07:43:10] frances: And then I listen to all sides
[25.08.21 07:43:22] angelo: yeah, it's fucked up. Bro, there's such a thing as magical fuck-ups, they were and will be.
[25.08.21 07:43:51] angelo: Calgon tells me this and that doesn't work
[25.08.21 07:44:03] angelo: i'm nobody at all, and you know how unpleasant it is?!?!?
[25.08.21 07:44:19] frances: i guess...
[25.08.21 07:45:03] angelo: i got the strategy, thanks
[25.08.21 20:32:11] angelo: hi.
[25.08.21 20:32:18] angelo: let's say VNC doesn't work
[25.08.21 20:32:35] angelo: nobody's here
[26.08.21 05:25:02] frances: Write the problem in detail
[31.08.21 18:08:09] angelo: hello! there's a question for zeus
[31.08.21 18:08:09] angelo: hello! there's a question for zeus
[31.08.21 18:08:27] angelo: Calgon gave a configuration addendum, but it's not encrypted, and it needs to be encrypted. Jaime doesn't know JS that well.
[31.08.21 18:08:40] angelo: should be done or should be rejected ?
[31.08.21 18:08:56] angelo: he who made this config should encrypt it
[31.08.21 18:31:44] frances: Hi.
[31.08.21 18:31:47] frances: Let them encrypt it themselves
[31.08.21 18:31:51] frances: We just put in their code
[31.08.21 18:58:54] angelo: I got you
[01.09.21 19:06:54] angelo: here ?

[01.09.21 19:29:33] angelo: if you need a coder, should I write to you or to Hammer ?
[01.09.21 19:32:02] frances: me and Hammer
[01.09.21 19:32:06] frances: what's the change?
[01.09.21 19:32:19] angelo: I'll throw the words to hime
[01.09.21 19:32:19] frances: there's something wrong with chromium?
[01.09.21 19:32:22] angelo: and
[01.09.21 19:32:25] angelo: yeah
[01.09.21 19:32:44] angelo: flip: Look, I need chrome to have some features disabled, I disable them through the command line, so these parameters need to be added by Graham when I upload my copy of chrome. I will see that they are already there and will not touch it.
[01.09.21 19:33:23] frances: go to vntz group or add heimi if these modules are interrelated
[01.09.21 19:33:39] angelo: I'm not there myself
