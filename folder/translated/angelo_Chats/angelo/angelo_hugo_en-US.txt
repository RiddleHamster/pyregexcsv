[27.07.21 18:11:03] angelo: hi
[27.07.21 18:11:18] angelo: You didn't create anything on modules there yet ?
[27.07.21 18:11:26] hugo: No.
[27.07.21 18:11:30] angelo: or gave up on AV module
[27.07.21 18:11:34] hugo: Yes
[27.07.21 18:11:41] hugo: I'm making a panel
[27.07.21 18:11:41] angelo: Got it.
[27.07.21 18:11:49] angelo: You asked
[27.07.21 18:11:56] angelo: got it
[27.07.21 18:12:22] hugo: I'm writing my terms of reference and will look for a new user on the exchange
[27.07.21 18:12:39] hugo: The old one sucked)
[27.07.21 18:12:47] angelo: panel to write?
[27.07.21 18:12:53] hugo: Yeah
[27.07.21 18:12:56] hugo: design
[27.07.21 18:13:14] hugo: I will write the logic +- myself in php
[27.07.21 18:13:24] angelo: I've seen only one cool panel here
[27.07.21 18:13:27] hugo: I will.
[27.07.21 18:13:32] angelo: everything else is trash
[27.07.21 18:13:35] hugo: Screenshots
[27.07.21 18:13:39] angelo: not only design but comfort
[27.07.21 18:14:03] hugo: I need screenshots and functionality as it is implemented there
[27.07.21 18:14:09] hugo: to copy
[27.07.21 18:14:18] angelo: not today
[27.07.21 18:14:32] hugo: Screenshots of the whole panel will be enough
[27.07.21 18:14:38] angelo: I only got 3 or 4
[27.07.21 18:14:50] hugo: Do you have access to the panel?
[27.07.21 18:14:58] hugo: What kind of panel?
[27.07.21 18:14:59] angelo: with bots ?
[27.07.21 18:15:07] angelo: admins uk
[27.07.21 18:15:08] angelo: tric
[27.07.21 18:15:09] hugo: Yes I will do with bots
[27.07.21 18:15:32] angelo: and there's another one I like best
[27.07.21 18:15:37] angelo: she is for module one
[27.07.21 18:15:44] angelo: but it's not sure if you still have access
[27.07.21 18:15:57] hugo: can you record the screen?
[27.07.21 18:16:11] hugo: And go into all the sections so I can see
[27.07.21 18:16:11] angelo: Theoretically, yes.
[27.07.21 18:16:31] hugo: Woot.
[27.07.21 18:16:35] hugo: Get on it.
[27.07.21 18:55:37] hugo: Are you there?
[27.07.21 18:56:16] hugo: I was screaming my head off when they did this
[27.07.21 18:56:18] hugo: https://i.postimg.cc/XY8CWL6v/1.png

[27.07.21 18:57:01] hugo: I expected this

[27.07.21 19:03:02] angelo: yeah
[27.07.21 19:03:04] angelo: not sugar
[27.07.21 19:03:13] angelo: crumbled design, no complicated
[27.07.21 19:03:33] angelo: I don't understand why the design should be simple
[27.07.21 19:03:34] hugo: I cut it off at once.
[27.07.21 19:03:49] angelo: but man, the 21 century, they do it in html5!
[27.07.21 19:04:02] angelo: You don't even have to render it.
[27.07.21 19:04:10] angelo: And here it's just like a schoolboy's.
[27.07.21 19:04:23] angelo: if we're talking purely about appearance
[27.07.21 19:04:37] hugo: I need beauty to sell
[27.07.21 19:05:08] hugo: Not this shit
[27.07.21 19:05:31] hugo: I'd be ashamed to give it
[27.07.21 19:30:06] angelo: I don't know how our guys sell it.
[27.07.21 19:30:09] angelo: and use
[27.07.21 19:30:14] angelo: for me it's a mishmash
[27.07.21 19:30:17] angelo: data overload
[27.07.21 19:30:26] angelo: don't speak about design at all
[27.07.21 19:30:39] hugo: Is it a shitty design?
[27.07.21 19:33:19] angelo: It is.
[27.07.21 19:33:24] angelo: it's stupidly absent
[27.07.21 19:33:31] hugo: Eww!
[27.07.21 19:33:39] hugo: I'm ashamed to sell it
[27.07.21 19:33:50] hugo: For 3-5k a month
[27.07.21 19:52:40] hugo: Good night.
[27.07.21 19:54:01] angelo: Good night!
[28.07.21 18:56:24] angelo: you know what, i'm fucked up
[28.07.21 18:56:45] hugo: hi.
[28.07.21 18:56:50] hugo: Yeah, me too, sometimes.
[28.07.21 18:56:57] angelo: No.
[28.07.21 18:56:59] angelo: I'm in general
[28.07.21 18:57:05] angelo: I'm fucked up that everything is fucked up
[28.07.21 18:57:13] hugo: By the way.
[28.07.21 18:57:20] hugo: What about the screens?
[28.07.21 18:57:27] angelo: and then they give you one when the client is already fucked up asking for help
[28.07.21 18:57:31] angelo: There will be screenshots
[28.07.21 18:57:48] hugo: And my cryptor died)
[28.07.21 18:57:54] hugo: Well, it's not cleaning
[28.07.21 18:58:10] hugo: I'll make a new one and crypt only dll -->dll
[28.07.21 18:58:20] hugo: They are not so badly binded
[28.07.21 18:59:02] angelo: yeah
[28.07.21 18:59:05] angelo: exactly so
[28.07.21 18:59:15] angelo: just fucked up, everything's wrong
[28.07.21 18:59:42] hugo: And it's your fault
[28.07.21 18:59:47] hugo: Who else?)
[28.07.21 19:00:14] angelo: I don't get paid to be fucked
[28.07.21 19:00:15] angelo: 1300, you're out of your fucking mind
[28.07.21 19:02:07] hugo: Hahaha
[28.07.21 19:07:26] angelo: Nah, it's starting to fuck me up, not the money
[28.07.21 19:07:41] hugo: hmm
[28.07.21 19:07:54] hugo: In life they fuck even harder and for pennies
[28.07.21 19:08:10] angelo: And sometimes it's vice versa.)
[28.07.21 19:08:16] angelo: why start from the bad
[28.07.21 19:08:25] angelo: it is convenient, but not perspective
[28.07.21 19:08:27] hugo: Yeah.
[28.07.21 19:08:51] angelo: so i can calm myself down looking at the local drunkard that my life was good)
[28.07.21 19:09:05] hugo: Hahaha
[28.07.21 19:09:11] hugo: Well, in fact, it was successful
[28.07.21 19:09:15] hugo: You got it all.
[28.07.21 19:09:22] hugo: A lot of people would envy you.
[28.07.21 19:09:39] angelo: But it's always good to wish for the best
[28.07.21 19:09:43] angelo: i understand
[28.07.21 19:09:52] angelo: 80% of the country's population would be envious
[28.07.21 19:09:54] hugo: Yeah, we gotta move forward.
[28.07.21 19:10:12] hugo: But to go you have to make an effort
[28.07.21 19:10:46] angelo: That's it.
[28.07.21 19:11:37] angelo: I just don't get enough sleep
[28.07.21 19:11:41] angelo: no more than 5-6 hours
[28.07.21 19:11:43] angelo: 4 today
[28.07.21 19:11:50] hugo: Get some sleep.
[28.07.21 19:11:55] angelo: 5 days a week
[28.07.21 19:11:56] hugo: You're not young.)
[28.07.21 19:11:57] angelo: no time)
[28.07.21 19:15:52] angelo: not young, but strong
[28.07.21 20:21:27] angelo: and you know, it's scary to think you could be sitting on that salary for years....
[28.07.21 20:21:34] angelo: that's fucked up for people after 50
[28.07.21 20:23:12] hugo: Yeah.
[28.07.21 20:23:34] hugo: Many people live on 10k
[28.07.21 20:23:58] hugo: And you're getting fat, you drink bread and tea.)
[28.07.21 20:27:12] angelo: The whole world can burn in flames my young friend
[28.07.21 20:27:18] angelo: even the whole galaxy
[28.07.21 20:27:27] angelo: there is my family
[28.07.21 20:28:00] hugo: Okay, philosopher.
[28.07.21 20:28:03] hugo: Good night)
[28.07.21 20:29:04] angelo: Okay.
[28.07.21 20:29:06] angelo: Good luck.
[30.07.21 16:27:55] hugo: Hi.
[30.07.21 16:28:06] hugo: Lipovsky, where are the screenshots?)
[30.07.21 16:28:11] angelo: Hi.
[30.07.21 16:28:16] angelo: didn't have time (
[30.07.21 16:28:21] angelo: that's fucked up.
[30.07.21 16:28:24] angelo: like there was no time
[30.07.21 16:28:29] angelo: I'll do it now
[30.07.21 16:28:46] angelo: don't do it the way we're doing it now, it ain't fucking working
[30.07.21 16:28:58] hugo: I won't do it that way
[30.07.21 16:29:05] hugo: I'm not good at this
[30.07.21 16:29:06] angelo: I don't mean the panels
[30.07.21 16:29:16] angelo: models
[30.07.21 16:29:18] angelo: modules
[30.07.21 16:29:23] angelo: this one doesn't work
[30.07.21 16:29:26] angelo: there's a glitch
[30.07.21 16:29:30] angelo: this one's fucked up
[30.07.21 16:29:48] hugo: Well, what do you want, a lot of people need to make these modules
[30.07.21 16:29:54] hugo: Fuck!
[30.07.21 16:30:00] hugo: People*.
[30.07.21 16:35:40] angelo: go outside
[30.07.21 16:36:14] hugo: Gobble, gobble, gobble
[30.07.21 16:36:42] hugo: I didn't understand what you said.)
[30.07.21 16:38:15] angelo: go outside toad
[30.07.21 16:38:32] hugo: Exploit?
[30.07.21 16:44:29] hugo: Get rid of search box from view near start, it interferes
[30.07.21 16:45:30] angelo: I don't think it blocks anything
[30.07.21 16:46:15] hugo: God!
[30.07.21 16:46:36] hugo: What a fucked-up design.
[30.07.21 16:46:46] hugo: I'd rip my arms off for that.
[30.07.21 16:46:56] hugo: And customers buy that?
[30.07.21 16:47:03] hugo: Geez.
[30.07.21 16:47:12] hugo: And you use that shit
[30.07.21 16:47:16] hugo: shit
[30.07.21 16:47:18] angelo: no one has even said a word yet
[30.07.21 16:47:25] angelo: as I know
[30.07.21 16:47:28] angelo: they don't give a fuck!)
[30.07.21 16:47:41] angelo: but of course it's better to be convenient and intuitive
[30.07.21 16:47:45] angelo: and this is all by the hand
[30.07.21 16:48:15] hugo: Well, my software will do them
[30.07.21 16:48:20] hugo: When I make it
[30.07.21 16:50:28] angelo: do it!
[30.07.21 16:50:49] hugo: Well, I have no choice in principle.
[30.07.21 16:50:55] hugo: I'll have to do it both ways.
[30.07.21 16:53:34] angelo: How long do you think?
[30.07.21 16:55:32] hugo: I have no rush
[30.07.21 16:55:40] hugo: I'm thinking it over.
[30.07.21 16:55:55] hugo: Because it costs me money
[30.07.21 16:56:02] hugo: Every mistake
[30.07.21 16:56:29] angelo: but don't take too long
[30.07.21 16:56:34] angelo: remind me
[30.07.21 16:56:35] hugo: Maybe a month, maybe two
[30.07.21 16:56:40] angelo: what exactly are you writing now
[30.07.21 16:56:44] angelo: lowader ?
[30.07.21 16:58:43] hugo: bot functions:

Downloading files (dll/exe/shell)
CMD/Powershell
User information and list of installed programs.
[30.07.21 16:58:52] hugo: Well, I'm not writing anything now
[30.07.21 16:59:05] hugo: I'm just writing bugs to make the panel ok
[30.07.21 16:59:16] hugo: And then how the panel will be made
[30.07.21 16:59:33] hugo: I will give this person a task to expand the functionality
[30.07.21 17:00:15] angelo: We have such a module
[30.07.21 17:00:19] angelo: I remember
[30.07.21 17:00:21] angelo: tested
[30.07.21 17:00:29] hugo: Well, it's a test.
[30.07.21 17:00:42] hugo: I'll stuff it later
[30.07.21 17:00:54] hugo: And keylogger and stylac
[30.07.21 17:00:57] hugo: And the clipper
[30.07.21 17:01:03] hugo: And cryptolocker
[30.07.21 17:01:11] hugo: And I have everything written
[30.07.21 17:01:20] hugo: It's just a panel
[30.07.21 17:01:27] angelo: is it like our modules on the trike?
[30.07.21 17:01:34] hugo: Probably
[30.07.21 17:01:37] angelo: i wish i fucking knew how
[30.07.21 17:01:47] angelo: I'd love to participate
[30.07.21 17:01:59] hugo: Then I'll add a file manager to laminate files
[30.07.21 17:02:04] hugo: Then process manager
[30.07.21 17:02:12] hugo: And registry manager
[30.07.21 17:02:27] hugo: And break it into modules
[30.07.21 17:02:35] hugo: You want that kind of functionality you gotta pay for
[30.07.21 17:02:44] hugo: You want another one, pay too
[30.07.21 17:02:53] hugo: In general for every taste
[30.07.21 17:03:11] hugo: But again, you need to get into the subject with the panel
[30.07.21 17:03:45] angelo: well, okay, make a modular system with lader
[30.07.21 17:03:55] angelo: not like ours, everything is stuck upside down.
[30.07.21 17:04:20] hugo: Well, I'm an interested party
[30.07.21 17:04:25] hugo: And they're not
[30.07.21 17:04:43] hugo: They're fucking around.
[30.07.21 17:04:47] hugo: Because it's not theirs
[30.07.21 17:05:12] angelo: I wonder if we even have any.
[30.07.21 17:05:51] hugo: dunno
[30.07.21 17:06:02] hugo: Unless he has his own money)
[30.07.21 17:06:46] angelo: i just expected something more
[30.07.21 17:06:49] angelo: global
[30.07.21 17:06:54] angelo: your own so to speak
[30.07.21 17:06:59] angelo: and here are alterations and modifications
[30.07.21 17:07:01] hugo: From me?
[30.07.21 17:07:08] hugo: Or from them?)
[30.07.21 17:07:17] hugo: They're after the money
[30.07.21 17:07:25] angelo: From them
[30.07.21 17:07:29] angelo: I'm an idealist
[30.07.21 17:07:34] hugo: Me too
[30.07.21 17:07:34] angelo: from my youth
[30.07.21 17:08:00] hugo: I like it when everything whistles and farts and glows.)
[30.07.21 17:08:11] angelo: ahahaha!)
[30.07.21 17:08:16] hugo: And it plays like herringbone.
[30.07.21 17:08:16] angelo: well, you gotta do good
[30.07.21 17:08:20] hugo: This is bullshit
[30.07.21 17:08:34] hugo: Some kind of skeleton
[30.07.21 17:08:46] angelo: Yeah, I got praise from clients, though I don't understand why
[30.07.21 17:08:53] angelo: I don't get it, I do shit
[30.07.21 17:09:03] angelo: retard can do it
[30.07.21 17:09:19] angelo: and it turns out a lot of people just fuckin' do everything
[30.07.21 17:09:21] angelo: from and to
[30.07.21 17:09:33] hugo: Yeah.
[30.07.21 17:09:35] angelo: how easy it is to surprise
[30.07.21 17:09:43] angelo: just do what they say and do it well
[30.07.21 17:09:56] angelo: I cut the pads off every night
[30.07.21 17:09:59] angelo: at 2-3 in the morning
[30.07.21 17:09:59] hugo: Do you milk them by the way?
[30.07.21 17:10:06] angelo: Well, as far as
[30.07.21 17:10:08] angelo: Very much so.
[30.07.21 17:10:13] hugo: You mean you cut it off?
[30.07.21 17:10:23] angelo: the guys stood up for me and asked me to kick it ))
[30.07.21 17:10:39] angelo: I mean rebooting the vpc
[30.07.21 17:10:45] angelo: and cleaning logs
[30.07.21 17:10:47] hugo: Why?
[30.07.21 17:11:01] angelo: they cut off the mailing at a certain time
[30.07.21 17:11:11] hugo: Oh, it's a newsletter.
[30.07.21 17:11:16] angelo: Yeah.
[30.07.21 17:11:16] hugo: I thought it was a bot.
[30.07.21 17:11:23] angelo: and dlloc distribution
[30.07.21 17:11:35] angelo: They don't have a simple call center system there
[30.07.21 17:11:56] hugo: I would replace your work with scripts, I would not do anything by hand every time
[30.07.21 17:12:39] hugo: I'll do the panel and the question of how to host it and how to do spacers and what is it anyway
[30.07.21 17:12:49] angelo: how ?! if the time is always changing
[30.07.21 17:13:03] angelo: if it would be possible to make a script on bash
[30.07.21 17:13:16] angelo: they have
[30.07.21 17:13:19] hugo: Well, time changes everywhere
[30.07.21 17:13:31] angelo: Well, in terms of killing a gasket at 2:00 a.m.
[30.07.21 17:13:38] angelo: Or tonight until 1 a.m.
[30.07.21 17:13:53] angelo: there's no way to automate it
[30.07.21 17:13:59] hugo: It will
[30.07.21 17:14:16] hugo: You have to compare times of a certain time zone or country
[30.07.21 17:14:23] angelo: Nope
[30.07.21 17:14:25] angelo: you don't understand

[16.08.21 18:08:48] angelo: and browsing exchange sites in general
[16.08.21 18:08:50] hugo: I'm thinking about tomorrow too.
[16.08.21 18:09:10] hugo: because exchangers work till 21:00 or 22
[16.08.21 18:09:25] hugo: + can't find a normal exchange
[16.08.21 18:10:16] angelo: tomorrow we'll look for it

[16.08.21 18:11:33] angelo: don't understand him
[16.08.21 18:18:17] hugo: The exchange rate is fucked up.
[16.08.21 18:18:30] hugo: They dictate their terms
[16.08.21 18:18:48] hugo: I check the transaction and many of them don't return the money
[16.08.21 18:18:56] hugo: Either confirmation of identity
[16.08.21 18:19:10] angelo: Yes, something wrong with them lately
[16.08.21 18:19:24] angelo: I'm afraid they'll soon be grabbing them by the balls
[16.08.21 18:19:31] angelo: and we'll search for exchangers on forums
[16.08.21 18:21:17] hugo: https://chby.io/exchange/vyvod_bitcoin_na_kartu_tinkoff/

[16.08.21 18:39:56] hugo: They're struggling with laundering
[16.08.21 18:40:03] hugo: And other crap
[16.08.21 18:40:32] hugo: I'm reading a lot of conditions and I'm freaking out.
[16.08.21 18:43:02] angelo: It's going to get worse
[16.08.21 18:43:10] angelo: We should have our own exchanger
[16.08.21 18:43:24] angelo: partner exchange
[16.08.21 18:43:33] angelo: launderer that is
[16.08.21 18:43:47] hugo: Either use monero

[16.08.21 18:44:09] angelo: withdrawal to the card
[16.08.21 18:44:22] angelo: I change the monero, it has more restrictions

[17.08.21 11:07:55] angelo: I'll wait a little longer
[17.08.21 12:56:33] hugo: Frans is off
[17.08.21 12:56:48] hugo: money went offline))
[17.08.21 12:57:00] angelo: )
[17.08.21 12:57:04] angelo: and you directly
[17.08.21 12:57:06] angelo: damn, I forget
[17.08.21 12:57:17] hugo: Directly?
[17.08.21 12:57:27] angelo: Well, not through your wallet

[18.08.21 19:32:52] hugo: Hi.
[18.08.21 19:33:04] hugo: What's going on?
[18.08.21 19:33:30] hugo: You mean admin panel?
[18.08.21 19:33:35] angelo: you're not family life
[18.08.21 19:33:41] angelo: and her
[18.08.21 19:33:46] angelo: but more about development
[18.08.21 19:34:16] hugo: I write specifications for the panel and the code itself in php
[18.08.21 19:34:38] hugo: I'll send it to the layout soon
[18.08.21 19:34:43] hugo: And there will be a panel
[18.08.21 19:34:52] hugo: But I design everything meticulously.
[18.08.21 19:35:05] hugo: I don't want to pay money for alterations
[18.08.21 19:35:14] angelo: That's right.
[18.08.21 19:35:17] angelo: and modules how ?
[18.08.21 19:35:30] hugo: Writing code in general and limits the panel structure
[18.08.21 19:35:30] angelo: man, I'm pissed off ))) with av)
[18.08.21 19:35:43] hugo: I gave up
[18.08.21 19:35:59] hugo: I'll add these modules to the botnet I'm making
[18.08.21 19:36:25] hugo: To keep everything in one harness
[18.08.21 19:36:44] angelo: I got you, tactics are clear.
[18.08.21 19:36:51] angelo: mine are fighting with each other
[18.08.21 19:36:54] angelo: that's sad
[18.08.21 19:37:03] angelo: their management is stupid
[18.08.21 19:37:08] hugo: Find out how much they pay monthly for software
[18.08.21 19:37:23] hugo: I'm thinking about my botnet for 6k
[18.08.21 19:37:27] hugo: Surrender
[18.08.21 19:37:51] hugo: But to build it and to build it, first the panel, and then the client itself
[18.08.21 19:37:59] hugo: And then think about the gaskets
[18.08.21 19:38:11] hugo: I want the user to make them himself
[18.08.21 19:38:56] angelo: ok, I will
[18.08.21 19:39:05] angelo: we communicate on trust level
[18.08.21 19:40:09] hugo: I just might be undercharged
[18.08.21 19:40:30] angelo: That's bad too
[18.08.21 19:40:32] hugo: And find out what they want in the admin panel
[18.08.21 19:40:35] angelo: not only because of income
[18.08.21 19:40:56] hugo: I'm just comparing with everyone
[18.08.21 19:41:04] hugo: And I understand that others are just crap
[18.08.21 19:41:16] hugo: Just a bare skeleton, that's all.
[18.08.21 19:42:38] angelo: you're a pili.....
[18.08.21 19:42:48] angelo: I won't say anything
[18.08.21 19:42:56] angelo: moreover here
[18.08.21 19:42:56] hugo: Well, yeah.
[18.08.21 19:43:13] angelo: Drink, you'll find clients for sure
[18.08.21 19:43:30] hugo: That's for sure, 100%.
[18.08.21 19:44:01] hugo: For I compared one sales loader with admin panel
[18.08.21 19:44:09] hugo: Price tag 5k there.
[18.08.21 19:44:15] hugo: And just a file download
[18.08.21 19:44:19] angelo: You were thinking about hacks?
[18.08.21 19:44:21] angelo: attacks
[18.08.21 19:44:22] hugo: And a lame dashboard
[18.08.21 19:44:26] angelo: on you
[18.08.21 19:44:39] hugo: I'll think it over.
[18.08.21 19:44:40] angelo: It's a common occurrence
[18.08.21 19:45:03] hugo: But you can't avoid them all the same
[18.08.21 19:45:13] hugo: We have to make a warning system
[18.08.21 19:45:31] hugo: Howl when it happens
[18.08.21 19:45:52] hugo: And we have to migrate to another server
[18.08.21 19:46:10] hugo: But first, you have to make the panel itself)
[18.08.21 19:46:21] hugo: And protection is minor things
[18.08.21 19:46:35] angelo: That would be convenient
[18.08.21 19:47:19] hugo: Anyway, I was given access to the admin panel of the loader
[18.08.21 19:47:31] hugo: And I was shocked, such a shit for 5k on sale
[18.08.21 19:47:32] hugo: That's hilarious.
[18.08.21 19:47:47] angelo: The main thing is that it works
[18.08.21 19:47:53] angelo: I'm not arguing
[18.08.21 19:47:53] hugo: Yes
[18.08.21 19:47:56] angelo: I'm pissed off myself.
[18.08.21 19:48:01] angelo: I'm an idealist and a perfectionist
[18.08.21 19:48:12] hugo: It should be nice and intuitive
[18.08.21 19:48:57] angelo: yeah UI design )
[18.08.21 19:51:04] hugo: Yeah

[20.08.21 13:21:01] angelo: You get money here
[20.08.21 13:21:04] angelo: not %
[20.08.21 13:21:33] hugo: You get a lot of money
[20.08.21 13:21:43] hugo: And software is complicated
[20.08.21 13:21:44] angelo: at redemptions a lot of things at %
[20.08.21 13:22:02] angelo: I got guys sitting on a locker
[20.08.21 13:22:09] angelo: coder
[20.08.21 13:22:11] hugo: % don't know what will happen
[20.08.21 13:22:23] hugo: They'll lower it and that's it
[20.08.21 13:22:28] angelo: Yeah, they've been sucking dick for a long time
[20.08.21 13:22:39] angelo: They don't pay shit
[20.08.21 13:22:51] angelo: but something tells me it's not clean
[20.08.21 13:23:05] angelo: there's often their own fuckin' money
[20.08.21 13:23:10] hugo: They don't get paid?
[20.08.21 13:23:12] angelo: That's a lot of money
[20.08.21 13:23:14] angelo: Nope.
[20.08.21 13:23:22] hugo: And they
[20.08.21 13:23:29] hugo: Well, sure.
[20.08.21 13:23:40] hugo: They took out a million and gave you 1k
[20.08.21 13:23:44] angelo: Sometimes they can give you 5 grand
[20.08.21 13:23:50] angelo: their own
[20.08.21 13:23:53] angelo: kt of the chain
[20.08.21 13:24:00] angelo: it's not uncommon
[20.08.21 13:24:16] hugo: So we get paid a penny
[20.08.21 13:24:24] hugo: Right?
[20.08.21 13:24:29] angelo: +-
[20.08.21 13:24:34] angelo: our staff is rubber-stamped
[20.08.21 13:24:45] hugo: rubbery?
[20.08.21 13:24:54] angelo: who sits well on the cipher, the operator himself, they have the most
[20.08.21 13:24:57] angelo: well there are many of us
[20.08.21 13:25:16] angelo: that's who does ramsom, one group has up to 100 million a year
[20.08.21 13:25:25] angelo: but this is an isolated case
[20.08.21 13:25:33] hugo: How do you know that?
[20.08.21 13:25:36] angelo: and you can't get to work in it ((
[20.08.21 13:25:39] hugo: Figures out of thin air?
[20.08.21 13:25:42] angelo: reading + socializing
[20.08.21 13:25:44] angelo: no
[20.08.21 13:25:47] angelo: they said
[20.08.21 13:25:51] angelo: in the interview
[20.08.21 13:25:57] angelo: if it can be called that
[20.08.21 13:26:10] hugo: Anything can be said that way
[20.08.21 13:26:33] angelo: this is the coolest cipher group
[20.08.21 13:26:37] angelo: They don't need to bullshit
[20.08.21 13:26:42] angelo: everybody knows them
[20.08.21 13:26:53] angelo: EvilCorm won't be fucked up either
[20.08.21 13:26:57] angelo: they're respected
[20.08.21 13:26:58] hugo: Are they in our rocket?
[20.08.21 13:27:09] hugo: Or our clients?
[20.08.21 13:27:10] angelo: I don't know.
[20.08.21 13:27:17] angelo: I think we're connected.
[20.08.21 13:27:21] angelo: To one degree or another
[20.08.21 13:27:35] angelo: stern is for sure.
[20.08.21 13:27:39] angelo: at his level
[20.08.21 13:27:50] hugo: Either he's a pawn with the money
[20.08.21 13:28:06] angelo: well, he's a pawn of course
[20.08.21 13:28:08] angelo: a link
[20.08.21 13:28:10] angelo: between us
[20.08.21 13:28:13] angelo: And shoulder straps
[20.08.21 13:28:40] angelo: sorry I don't know much
[20.08.21 13:28:49] angelo: I never got to chat
[20.08.21 13:29:00] angelo: not everyone wants to know
[20.08.21 13:29:12] hugo: Fine, go ahead.)
[20.08.21 13:29:31] angelo: I'm half busy, I gotta write to Stern, maybe they'll give me something else.
[20.08.21 13:29:47] hugo: What can they give you?
[20.08.21 13:29:53] angelo: client
[20.08.21 13:29:57] angelo: if available
[20.08.21 13:30:04] hugo: does he give them out?
[20.08.21 13:30:06] angelo: I have clients, but they have no extras ((
[20.08.21 13:30:13] angelo: I don't know, honestly
[20.08.21 13:30:17] angelo: no idea
[20.08.21 13:32:42] angelo: and in general, we get paid well, we're the ones over 50
[20.08.21 13:32:49] angelo: and there are a lot of them here
[20.08.21 13:32:55] angelo: over 60
[20.08.21 13:33:11] hugo: Old people?)
[20.08.21 13:33:19] angelo: Yeah.
[20.08.21 13:33:29] angelo: i told you, it's not just by age
[20.08.21 13:33:43] hugo: Not by age, by skill
[20.08.21 13:34:36] angelo: Nope.
[20.08.21 13:34:41] angelo: age also plays a role
[20.08.21 13:34:50] angelo: they try to take older people
[20.08.21 13:34:54] angelo: by ads
[20.08.21 13:34:58] angelo: so they don't leave
[20.08.21 13:35:05] angelo: trust me
[20.08.21 13:35:09] angelo: I know what I'm talking about
[20.08.21 13:35:31] hugo: you didn't?
[20.08.21 13:35:44] hugo: So anyone can leave
[20.08.21 13:36:16] angelo: Where would 50+ guys go with 200 thousand?
[20.08.21 13:36:22] angelo: Think about it.
[20.08.21 13:36:26] angelo: this is heaven for them
[23.08.21 17:56:16] hugo: hi.
[23.08.21 17:56:20] hugo: You recognize this?

[23.08.21 17:56:39] hugo: Okay.
[23.08.21 17:56:50] angelo: that's fucked up
[23.08.21 17:56:54] angelo: How am I gonna live?
[23.08.21 17:57:05] hugo: Same as always
[23.08.21 17:58:48] angelo: Yeah, give me back my allowance

[23.08.21 18:10:28] angelo: telegram
[23.08.21 18:10:40] hugo: did you create it on your phone?
[23.08.21 18:10:52] angelo: just wanted to write don't ask stupid questions
[23.08.21 18:11:05] angelo: Left sim card
[23.08.21 18:11:45] hugo: Hmm
[23.08.21 18:11:51] hugo: I'll buy one too.
[23.08.21 18:12:06] hugo: Otherwise my telegram is on my sim
[23.08.21 18:12:15] angelo: no way
[23.08.21 18:12:22] angelo: or even through services
[23.08.21 18:12:24] angelo: don't
[23.08.21 18:12:34] angelo: where they give the number online for telegram
[23.08.21 18:12:45] angelo: physical left sim

[24.08.21 18:17:06] angelo: Hi.
[24.08.21 18:17:09] angelo: Nope.
[24.08.21 18:17:10] angelo: ((
[24.08.21 18:17:19] hugo: do you pad through Enercoin DNS?
[24.08.21 18:17:29] angelo: chito ?!
[24.08.21 18:17:45] angelo: I just register the host and do the forwarding
[24.08.21 18:17:55] angelo: you want to know exactly how
[24.08.21 18:17:57] angelo: if you need
[24.08.21 18:18:05] hugo: yes
[24.08.21 18:18:12] hugo: Give me the steps.
[24.08.21 18:18:12] angelo: you can ask our guys
[24.08.21 18:19:47] angelo: I'm not technically good at this
[24.08.21 18:19:48] angelo: I'll ask
[24.08.21 18:20:05] angelo: you do not communicate with naishi on the pads ?
[24.08.21 18:20:13] angelo: although yes
[24.08.21 18:20:18] hugo: It's just usually hosts do it through Enercoin Dns blockchain
[24.08.21 18:20:20] angelo: why the fuck would you talk to them
[24.08.21 18:20:22] hugo: that's what I had
[24.08.21 18:20:30] hugo: And when I was making the loader
[24.08.21 18:20:33] angelo: what is it ?
[24.08.21 18:20:48] angelo: the gasket is a UPU server
[24.08.21 18:20:53] hugo: yeah
[24.08.21 18:20:56] angelo: on the same linux with forwarding
[24.08.21 18:21:05] angelo: nothing more
[24.08.21 18:21:11] hugo: And Enercoin Dns is not a dependent host
[24.08.21 18:21:24] hugo: Which cannot be blocked
[24.08.21 18:21:31] angelo: you won't always be on the same host?
[24.08.21 18:21:36] angelo: they alternate
[24.08.21 18:21:53] angelo: you can't block
[24.08.21 18:22:00] angelo: how ?!
[24.08.21 18:22:17] angelo: have you thought about doing a locker ?
[24.08.21 18:22:19] hugo: Well, you can't, that's all.
[24.08.21 18:22:25] angelo: the most popular topic now
[24.08.21 18:22:48] angelo: We have a major client
[24.08.21 18:22:59] angelo: and here they are dreaming about ramsom themselves
[24.08.21 18:23:27] hugo: https://roskomsvoboda.org/post/emercoin-detsentralizovannyij-alternativnyi/
[24.08.21 18:25:11] hugo: what is "ramsome"?
[24.08.21 18:29:24] hugo: you need to read EmerCoin DNS
[24.08.21 18:29:33] hugo: You'll have to do it later)
[24.08.21 18:29:55] hugo: For if clients buy it, they will forbid you to do it)
[24.08.21 18:31:08] angelo: it's a cracker
[24.08.21 18:31:12] angelo: so bro, not here
[24.08.21 18:31:15] angelo: go to the toad
[06.09.21 18:48:45] hugo: Hi.
[06.09.21 18:48:50] hugo: How was work?)
[06.09.21 19:06:33] angelo: Hi.
[06.09.21 19:06:38] angelo: So-so.
[06.09.21 19:06:44] angelo: sad, sad, sad
[06.09.21 19:06:53] hugo: What?
[06.09.21 19:07:24] hugo: I had such an interesting dream)
[06.09.21 19:07:25] angelo: Clients aren't doing so well.
[06.09.21 19:07:32] angelo: we're having alterations
[06.09.21 19:07:39] angelo: surprise!)
[06.09.21 19:08:06] hugo: Like I'm dragging bags of money from school and hiding from everyone in the corners
[06.09.21 19:08:27] hugo: And the fun is that they are transparent)))
[06.09.21 19:08:55] hugo: What kind of alterations do you have?
[06.09.21 19:10:02] angelo: you're fucking dreaming
[06.09.21 19:10:06] angelo: it must have deep meaning
[06.09.21 19:10:10] angelo: new client
[06.09.21 19:10:18] angelo: a lot of changes and updates
[06.09.21 19:10:30] hugo: fat means
[06.09.21 19:10:31] angelo: and the injector has a problem with another module
[06.09.21 19:10:34] angelo: configure
[06.09.21 19:10:41] angelo: well, not like that
[06.09.21 19:10:49] hugo: What does he want?
[06.09.21 19:10:58] hugo: What are his requirements?
[06.09.21 19:11:28] angelo: Oh, he's redesigning and reworking all the modules we have
[06.09.21 19:11:31] hugo: And how much he pays them?
[06.09.21 19:11:38] angelo: %
[06.09.21 19:11:42] hugo: I see.
[06.09.21 19:11:44] angelo: I don't know how much.
[06.09.21 19:12:01] angelo: the second one's not doing so well with the ransom
[06.09.21 19:12:09] angelo: xls are messy
[06.09.21 19:12:18] hugo: document?
[06.09.21 19:12:22] angelo: and that's where my tip evaporated
[06.09.21 19:12:24] angelo: yes
[06.09.21 19:12:35] hugo: Exploit or macros?
[06.09.21 19:12:41] angelo: macro
[06.09.21 19:12:50] angelo: there's a problem
[06.09.21 19:12:51] angelo: in general
[06.09.21 19:12:58] angelo: people are not actively poking
[06.09.21 19:13:08] angelo: nobody pays ransom
[06.09.21 19:13:12] angelo: AB fucked up)
[06.09.21 19:13:19] angelo: so all at once
[06.09.21 19:13:23] hugo: customers always need new software?
[06.09.21 19:13:32] angelo: want to know what kind of locker they have
[06.09.21 19:13:52] angelo: I'm only familiar with three, it's hard to make a conclusion
[06.09.21 19:13:56] angelo: and they are different customers
[06.09.21 19:14:01] angelo: who has a scheme of years working
[06.09.21 19:14:21] angelo: who is like our main one now, he uses everything we have but the locker
[06.09.21 19:14:51] hugo: How's he like vinigred?)
[06.09.21 19:15:04] angelo: there are many
[06.09.21 19:15:06] angelo: in the band
[06.09.21 19:15:11] angelo: each does his own
[06.09.21 19:15:15] angelo: complicated guys
[06.09.21 19:15:53] hugo: And I write all the terms of reference and the server side of the admin panel)
[06.09.21 19:15:59] hugo: all
[06.09.21 19:16:38] angelo: not easy
[06.09.21 19:16:53] hugo: Constant rework, so I didn't give it to layout, I'm sorry for money
[06.09.21 19:17:03] angelo: How much did you want?
[06.09.21 19:17:13] hugo: Yeah, I'm not a web developer.
[06.09.21 19:17:25] hugo: I haven't come to that yet)
[06.09.21 19:17:35] hugo: They see the panel immediately merges))
[06.09.21 19:17:41] angelo: What is the engine?
[06.09.21 19:17:51] angelo: you have to write there
[06.09.21 19:17:54] angelo: probably from scratch
[06.09.21 19:17:59] hugo: Ralavel
[06.09.21 19:18:09] angelo: haven't even heard
[06.09.21 19:18:17] hugo: But I do database structure and API
[06.09.21 19:18:31] hugo: If you give them from scratch, they will do it wrong
[06.09.21 19:18:43] hugo: They are amoebas.
[06.09.21 19:18:54] angelo: Mostly I think so.
[06.09.21 19:19:29] angelo: Man, I gotta get some money from the customers
[06.09.21 19:19:29] hugo: Maybe less than 30k
[06.09.21 19:19:40] angelo: but I'll have to haggle again ((
[06.09.21 19:19:57] angelo: Up to 30k is normal without any frills
[06.09.21 19:19:57] hugo: Basically, I've almost done all the logic, I just need to display
[06.09.21 19:20:02] angelo: in design
[06.09.21 19:20:10] angelo: ok then
[06.09.21 19:20:22] angelo: it's just not trivial
[06.09.21 19:20:30] hugo: It is.
[06.09.21 19:20:46] hugo: But I'm just masquerading as a normal admin panel
[06.09.21 19:20:53] hugo: Mol not a botnet.)
[06.09.21 19:21:11] angelo: Oh man, that's it!
[06.09.21 19:21:13] hugo: But if a guy's smart, he'll understand
[06.09.21 19:21:16] angelo: the task
[06.09.21 19:23:19] hugo: Need money
[06.09.21 19:23:23] hugo: I want a house!)
[06.09.21 19:23:25] hugo: https://catalog-plans.ru/catalog/58-21L
[06.09.21 19:23:32] hugo: Well, like this.
[06.09.21 19:24:04] hugo: 6,000 bucks.
[06.09.21 19:24:21] angelo: We have the same taste
[06.09.21 19:24:29] angelo: the same one I wanted +- but of bar
[06.09.21 19:24:47] hugo: I'm from brick
[06.09.21 19:24:53] hugo: I don't want wood
[06.09.21 19:25:06] hugo: We have wooden houses burning down everywhere
[06.09.21 19:25:06] angelo: Bricks are cool too, just not foam blocks
[06.09.21 19:25:23] hugo: Gas concrete covered with bricks
[06.09.21 19:25:46] hugo: Aerated concrete is better than brick
[06.09.21 19:26:06] hugo: Brick loses its properties, and crumbles saw on YouTube
[06.09.21 19:26:17] hugo: In general, you need money
[06.09.21 19:27:24] hugo: I get 2.5 million a year with this salary
[06.09.21 19:27:24] hugo: That's fucked up.
[06.09.21 19:28:07] hugo: Many people make over 1 million a month on bullshit software)
[06.09.21 19:29:20] hugo: If there will be 2 clents, it's already 1 million a month
[06.09.21 19:29:40] hugo: But before that, a lot of fucking with the software.
[06.09.21 19:29:44] hugo: And admin panel
[06.09.21 19:30:18] angelo: and other money
[06.09.21 19:30:22] angelo: + sundress will be
[06.09.21 19:30:28] angelo: there's a lot of people living on the sundress
[06.09.21 19:30:36] angelo: specifics
[06.09.21 19:31:01] angelo: yeah, kids shoot bullshit in tik tok making more money and retards in insta
[06.09.21 19:31:05] angelo: that's a shame
[06.09.21 19:31:07] hugo: I want to go on vacation next month and fuck up the admin panel and the software
[06.09.21 19:31:44] angelo: that's right too, get busy
[06.09.21 19:32:03] angelo: sorry, my wife and i just downloaded
[06.09.21 19:32:10] angelo: caveman
[06.09.21 19:32:16] angelo: I don't know if it's bullshit or not
[06.09.21 19:32:27] angelo: it's been a long day at home

[23.09.21 17:53:00] angelo: we don't
[23.09.21 17:53:09] angelo: prices are always fixed
[23.09.21 17:53:16] hugo: I mean, basic concrete cost 2k now 8k per cube
[23.09.21 17:53:19] angelo: And then they do not look at the foreign market and currency
[23.09.21 17:53:27] angelo: yes yes yes]
[23.09.21 17:53:32] angelo: everything went up
[23.09.21 17:53:45] hugo: But not four times
[23.09.21 17:53:48] hugo: that's not normal
[23.09.21 17:54:01] hugo: I wanted to build and then this
[23.09.21 17:54:14] angelo: shit started that fall
[23.09.21 17:54:22] angelo: and continues
[09/23/221 17:54:24] hugo: It should go away
[09/23/221 17:54:31] hugo: The market will crash
[9/23/221 17:54:37] hugo: No one will buy
[9/23/221 17:57:12] angelo: you know, that's what a lot of product categories thought.
[9/23/221 17:57:21] angelo: but people keep gnashing their teeth and buying
[9/23/221 17:57:38] hugo: Well, I'm not buying.
[23.09.21 17:57:50] hugo: The walls alone are worth a thousand dollars.
[23.09.21 17:58:02] hugo: They're not made of gold.
[23.09.21 17:58:17] angelo: 4 times too much
[23.09.21 17:58:28] angelo: many materials doubled in price
[23.09.21 17:58:58] hugo: They say we ran out of aerated concrete and the price went up
[23.09.21 18:01:11] angelo: I wonder why
[9/23/221 18:01:30] angelo: fiberboard doubled
[23.09.21 18:01:33] angelo: sawdust bitch

[9/23/221 18:01:45] hugo: )
[9/23/221 18:02:03] angelo: better to give to china more expensive than to sell internally
[9/23/221 18:02:31] hugo: Let's build a house of shit and sticks
[9/23/221 18:02:39] hugo: Though only from shit

[28.09.21 10:40:58] angelo: now I have a headache.
[28.09.21 10:41:07] hugo: You should have slept.
[28.09.21 10:41:40] angelo: unfortunately I get up early, they won't let me sleep
[28.09.21 10:41:55] angelo: I think I'll sleep for an hour now, but I have things to do...
[28.09.21 10:42:02] angelo: clients will write more

[28.09.21 10:42:31] angelo: never
[28.09.21 10:42:35] angelo: have you?
[28.09.21 10:43:28] angelo: i honestly don't like vacations, i have a feeling you're missing something
[28.09.21 10:46:10] hugo: Nope, but I want to take one.
[28.09.21 10:46:42] hugo: No you just do nothing for two weeks and you get paid for it))
[28.09.21 10:47:06] hugo: Just like a deputy))
[28.09.21 10:47:13] angelo: )))
[28.09.21 10:47:16] angelo: I guess so.
[28.09.21 10:47:29] angelo: what about the vacation?
[28.09.21 10:47:35] angelo: not even go anywhere
[28.09.21 10:47:44] hugo: Go to sleep
[28.09.21 10:47:49] hugo: Watch soap operas.
[28.09.21 10:47:58] hugo: I want to renovate my apartment.
[28.09.21 10:48:12] angelo: Come on, it's better to go somewhere, at least rent a house from the city
[28.09.21 10:48:18] angelo: get some fresh air
[28.09.21 10:48:38] angelo: Man, I also need to finish repairs, but it's hard - toilet/bathroom
[28.09.21 10:48:47] angelo: nobody should be home
[28.09.21 10:49:55] hugo: Hire someone.
[28.09.21 10:50:22] angelo: Oh, I don't like it, you know, I've been treated more than once - then it takes longer to fix it
[28.09.21 10:50:38] angelo: when repairing, it's 50-50 that you'll get it done right + it costs money
[28.09.21 10:50:47] angelo: they'll take 100 thousand for the work
[28.09.21 10:51:41] hugo: Remind me, have you ever built a house?
[28.09.21 10:52:02] angelo: Nope.
[28.09.21 10:52:08] angelo: just dreamed about it.
[28.09.21 10:52:24] hugo: So I'm thinking company or crew.
[28.09.21 10:52:34] hugo: I'm afraid there'll be handymen
[28.09.21 10:52:40] hugo: Who'll screw everything up
[28.09.21 10:53:06] angelo: that's not easy
[28.09.21 10:53:14] angelo: you have to understand what they're doing
[28.09.21 10:53:18] hugo: You have to look for one with a reputation
[28.09.21 10:53:24] hugo: Small town
[28.09.21 10:53:41] hugo: Everyone will know about the handicapped
[28.09.21 10:53:56] angelo: That's the advantage of a small town
[28.09.21 10:54:07] hugo: And the prices are lower.
[28.09.21 10:54:08] angelo: I deal with them often
[28.09.21 10:54:14] angelo: They can't even change the faucet
[28.09.21 10:54:56] angelo: rarely have I seen normal performers, it's a disaster here
[28.09.21 10:58:21] angelo: But otherwise, I don't care what crew, you need to choose a foreman
[29.09.21 20:06:29] hugo: Hi.
[29.09.21 20:06:34] hugo: How's the paper one?
[29.09.21 20:06:42] angelo: Hi.
[29.09.21 20:06:50] angelo: first look and get up yet
[29.09.21 20:07:04] hugo: didn't like it?
[29.09.21 20:07:09] angelo: It's a little farfetched.
[29.09.21 20:07:25] angelo: I wish it was more realistic.
[29.09.21 20:07:44] hugo: So you liked it?
[29.09.21 20:08:00] hugo: Gourmet, man.)
[29.09.21 20:08:16] angelo: So-so.
[29.09.21 20:08:18] angelo: medium.
[29.09.21 20:08:23] angelo: Watch Ripper Street
[29.09.21 20:08:30] hugo: Yeah, when there's nothing to see
[29.09.21 20:08:30] angelo: and the Knickerbocker Clinic
[29.09.21 20:08:40] angelo: damn good shows
[29.09.21 20:08:56] angelo: yeah, i think i'll read again
[29.09.21 20:09:09] angelo: because video is just garbage clogging up your brain
[29.09.21 20:09:26] angelo: no excitement, no intrigue
[29.09.21 20:09:43] angelo: everything is calculated in advance, and the soul does not enjoy the process
[29.09.21 20:09:46] hugo: Did you see the queen's move?
[29.09.21 20:09:59] angelo: I did.
[29.09.21 20:10:02] angelo: cute.
[29.09.21 20:10:06] hugo: Yeah.)
[29.09.21 20:10:13] hugo: The actress is cool.)
[29.09.21 20:10:20] hugo: And the gentlemen?
[29.09.21 20:10:29] hugo: It's a movie.
[29.09.21 20:11:31] angelo: Of course I did.)
[29.09.21 20:11:43] angelo: I'll be rewatching big bang theory
[29.09.21 20:11:55] hugo: Who's the doctor?
[29.09.21 20:11:55] angelo: that's where you can laugh heartily
[29.09.21 20:12:02] hugo: I didn't watch it.
[29.09.21 20:12:06] angelo: didn't come in at the time
[29.09.21 20:12:13] angelo: I don't remember what and how
[29.09.21 20:12:30] angelo: It seems you have to revise, not watch.
[29.09.21 20:12:58] hugo: And locke keys?
[29.09.21 20:13:41] angelo: No, I left them for my wife.
[29.09.21 20:13:48] angelo: i like black.
[29.09.21 20:13:57] hugo: i'm waiting for locke's keys, very strange affairs, witch doctor, and venom
[29.09.21 20:14:18] angelo: life is pain mixed with misery
[29.09.21 20:14:45] angelo: that's why I like soap operas either radiating realism or comedies
[29.09.21 20:14:50] hugo: So you like anything that looks like a squid game?
[29.09.21 20:15:21] angelo: Well, that's a little off topic, but that's the gist of it. Yeah.
[29.09.21 20:15:35] angelo: filth, sex, drugs, mayhem
[29.09.21 20:15:45] angelo: So life shows)
[29.09.21 20:16:35] angelo: and now I'll turn it on at night like always
[29.09.21 20:16:50] angelo: How the universe works season 8

[29.09.21 20:18:08] angelo: very cool show
[29.09.21 20:18:15] angelo: unlike anything else
[29.09.21 20:18:35] angelo: almost all seasons as a work of art
[29.09.21 20:18:43] angelo: there's one splash screen is just a masterpiece
[29.09.21 20:18:45] hugo: 13 fucking seasons
[29.09.21 20:19:16] angelo: shit
[29.09.21 20:19:20] angelo: didn't even know
[29.09.21 20:19:29] angelo: they are different
[29.09.21 20:19:39] angelo: but the plot slips through sometimes
[29.09.21 20:19:57] hugo: I don't like horror
[29.09.21 20:20:02] hugo: There will be mosquitoes
[29.09.21 20:20:09] hugo: I don't need them.)
[29.09.21 20:20:18] angelo: you don't like nightmares ?!?
[29.09.21 20:20:25] hugo: Huh.
[29.09.21 20:20:27] angelo: any dream is a gift from the brain
[29.09.21 20:20:34] angelo: to create
[29.09.21 20:20:42] angelo: I dream every other day
[29.09.21 20:20:46] hugo: have you had sleep paralysis?
[29.09.21 20:20:47] angelo: and sometimes every day
[29.09.21 20:20:52] angelo: sure.
[29.09.21 20:20:56] hugo: And how?
[29.09.21 20:21:04] angelo: It's okay.)
[29.09.21 20:21:07] angelo: rare.
[29.09.21 20:21:18] hugo: I had it once.
[29.09.21 20:21:31] hugo: I got a panic attack
[29.09.21 20:21:40] angelo: It happens ))))))
[29.09.21 20:21:57] angelo: I have it more often when I woke up and didn't realize I was awake
[29.09.21 20:22:06] hugo: Some schmuck in black came to the bed, and I couldn't move
[29.09.21 20:22:18] angelo: And dreams are realistic and sometimes scary like life in Cheoyabinsk
[29.09.21 20:22:28] angelo: punk?
[29.09.21 20:22:31] angelo: dream?
[29.09.21 20:22:57] hugo: The worst thing is when you can't tell the difference between dream and life, like a memory
[29.09.21 20:23:04] angelo: trust me, dreams are cool, why after 25-30 years they happen very rarely
[29.09.21 20:23:17] angelo: yeah, you can fall in love
[29.09.21 20:23:22] angelo: like in life
[29.09.21 20:23:28] angelo: or you can wake up from being dead
[29.09.21 20:23:35] angelo: I love dreams
[29.09.21 20:23:40] hugo: Did you catch bullets?
[29.09.21 20:23:43] angelo: it's like getting high on drugs without the drugs
[29.09.21 20:23:48] angelo: and there were bullets
[29.09.21 20:23:50] angelo: what about it
[29.09.21 20:23:56] angelo: i liked falling more
[29.09.21 20:24:02] angelo: like in an airplane or a helicopter
[29.09.21 20:24:10] hugo: I didn't
[29.09.21 20:24:10] angelo: waking up and just in shock )
[29.09.21 20:24:20] angelo: very cool!!!
[29.09.21 20:24:33] hugo: did you take drugs?
[29.09.21 20:24:41] hugo: drugs
[29.09.21 20:24:42] angelo: in my youth
[29.09.21 20:24:47] hugo: Fuck.
[29.09.21 20:24:49] hugo: And how?
[29.09.21 20:24:56] angelo: not heavy.
[29.09.21 20:25:03] angelo: it's hard to say how.
[29.09.21 20:25:06] hugo: What's the effect?
[29.09.21 20:25:20] hugo: Any hallucinations?
[29.09.21 20:25:21] angelo: Man, I used to love hallucinations.
[29.09.21 20:25:37] angelo: cool.
[29.09.21 20:25:53] angelo: if you're well-read, intelligent and have imagination in your head
[29.09.21 20:26:16] angelo: but it was all mixed up in my youth
[29.09.21 20:26:24] angelo: with alcohol and severe depression
[29.09.21 20:26:44] angelo: so it's not what's needed and not what's having the right effect
[29.09.21 20:27:05] angelo: that's why you should try and live 100 lives on different planets
[29.09.21 20:27:18] hugo: Ahaha
[29.09.21 20:27:28] angelo: feel the universe expanding and you feel the solar wind........
[29.09.21 20:27:29] angelo: eh
[29.09.21 20:27:30] hugo: I'm going to bed, good night.
[29.09.21 20:27:36] angelo: go ahead )
[29.09.21 20:27:40] angelo: good night.)
[29.09.21 20:27:46] angelo: but I don't recommend it!
[29.09.21 20:27:56] hugo: I'm a goiter.
[29.09.21 20:28:03] angelo: me too
[29.09.21 20:28:09] hugo: I didn't even drink champagne.
[29.09.21 20:28:16] hugo: I never smoked either.
[29.09.21 20:28:18] angelo: And well done.
[29.09.21 20:28:26] angelo: The main thing is not to get cancer
[29.09.21 20:28:29] angelo: It would be a shame
[29.09.21 20:28:33] hugo: Hahaha
[29.09.21 20:28:39] hugo: Tell me about it.
[29.09.21 20:28:51] angelo: Well, we'll try not to catch it.
[29.09.21 20:29:00] angelo: only crabs in restaurants)
[29.09.21 20:29:10] angelo: I'm going to bed too
[29.09.21 20:29:13] angelo: good night !
[01.10.21 19:25:50] hugo: Hi.
[01.10.21 19:25:57] hugo: Any news about salary?
[01.10.21 19:26:02] angelo: Hi.
[01.10.21 19:26:04] angelo: Mon.
[01.10.21 19:26:09] hugo: You've made a mess of the conversation, I can't find anything there))
[01.10.21 19:26:57] angelo: ahahaha
[01.10.21 19:27:05] angelo: You need a break
[01.10.21 19:27:12] angelo: I have one
[01.10.21 19:27:14] angelo: to chat
[01.10.21 19:27:16] hugo: I'm going to bed, good night)
[01.10.21 19:27:21] angelo: good night !
[01.10.21 19:27:23] angelo: lucky
[01.10.21 19:27:26] angelo: sleep tight
[16.11.21 11:47:40] hugo: Hi.
[16.11.21 11:47:48] hugo: You didn't miss a paycheck?
[16.11.21 11:47:55] angelo: hi.
[16.11.21 11:48:00] angelo: did I write you?)
[16.11.21 11:48:08] hugo: ))
[16.11.21 11:48:25] hugo: did you look at arcane?
[16.11.21 11:48:35] hugo: There's three more episodes
[11/16/2011 11:48:38] angelo: nope.
[16.11.21 11:48:40] hugo: Just fire.
[16.11.21 11:48:49] angelo: while the big bang theory
[11/16/11/21 11:48:58] hugo: What's it about?
[16.11.21 11:49:06] hugo: Maybe I should watch it too.
[16.11.21 11:49:08] angelo: science geniuses.
[16.11.21 11:49:17] angelo: mixed with humor
[16.11.21 11:49:25] angelo: three scientists and a blonde
[16.11.21 11:51:47] hugo: Hahaha
[16.11.21 11:52:11] hugo: 3 Negroes and a blonde?
[16.11.21 12:04:54] angelo: no, those are other scientists
[16.11.21 12:04:57] angelo: gynecologists
[16.11.21 12:05:01] angelo: it's an exact science
[16.11.21 18:08:45] hugo: what's with the france?
[16.11.21 18:09:06] hugo: Went to the Maldives?)
[16.11.21 18:09:20] angelo: sick.
[16.11.21 18:09:33] hugo: Oh.
[16.11.21 18:09:40] hugo: Zp got sick))
[16.11.21 18:10:36] angelo: yeah
[19.11.21 12:59:57] hugo: Hi.
[19.11.21 13:00:09] hugo: Got a good movie for you
[19.11.21 13:00:55] hugo: "Finch" is good, calm and interesting, made by Apple
[19.11.21 13:01:06] hugo: It's about a robot.
[19.11.21 13:27:31] angelo: hi.
[19.11.21 13:27:34] angelo: It's with
[19.11.21 13:27:36] angelo: what's his name?
[19.11.21 13:27:38] angelo: new ?
[19.11.21 13:27:45] angelo: I already downloaded it thank you]
[19.11.21 13:27:47] angelo: waiting for mine
[11/23/11/21 19:18:37] hugo: Hi.
[23.11.21 19:18:43] hugo: Did you look at arcane?
[11/23/221 19:19:02] angelo: hi.
[11/23/221 19:19:02] angelo: Nope.
[11/23/11/21/19:19:08] angelo: 11 seasons.
[23.11.21 19:19:16] angelo: I've watched nine.
[23.11.21 19:19:20] angelo: that's 130 episodes
[11/23/11/21 19:19:32] hugo: 11 seasons of what?
[11/23/11/21 19:19:42] angelo: The Big Bang Theory
[11/23/11/21 19:19:45] hugo: tastic.
[23.11.21 19:19:56] hugo: you can go cuckoo))
[11/23/221 19:20:10] hugo: Okay, good night.
[11/23/221 19:20:39] angelo: Good night.)
[23.11.21 19:20:44] angelo: you won't go.)
[25.11.21 15:21:21] hugo: Hi.
[25.11.21 15:21:30] hugo: Forgot one show for you
[25.11.21 15:21:53] angelo: Hi.
[25.11.21 15:21:55] hugo: Have you seen "lost in space"?
[25.11.21 15:22:13] angelo: mm-hmm.
[11/25/1921 15:22:15] angelo: something looks familiar.
[25.11.21 15:22:29] angelo: seen it
[25.11.21 15:22:30] angelo: )
[25.11.21 15:22:46] hugo: What's it about?
[25.11.21 15:23:11] angelo: I don't remember anymore
[25.11.21 15:23:13] hugo: It's about a robot.
[25.11.21 15:23:16] angelo: Mine watched more than I did.
[11/25/21/221 15:23:22] hugo: Here.
[11/25/21/221 15:23:31] hugo: There's another season coming out in December
[25.11.21 15:23:33] angelo: I need to finish this one.
[25.11.21 15:23:37] angelo: 2 seasons left
[25.11.21 15:23:44] hugo: Yeah.
[25.11.21 15:23:49] hugo: And then start arcane
[11/25/21/221 15:23:53] hugo: He's a piece of cake.
[25.11.21 15:25:32] angelo: Man, then you might want to play too.
[11/25/2011 15:26:09] hugo: Fuck!
[25.11.21 15:26:18] hugo: There's a witch doctor coming.))
[25.11.21 15:26:19] angelo: Tell me about it.
[11/25/21/221 15:26:28] hugo: Uh-huh.
[25.11.21 15:27:39] angelo: I'll check out your arcane.
[25.11.21 15:27:46] angelo: I'm gonna read The Witcher.
[25.11.21 15:27:52] angelo: and then watch something on it
[01.12.21 11:07:25] hugo: Hi.
[01.12.21 11:07:33] angelo: hello!
[01.12.21 11:07:33] hugo: got your salary?
[01.12.21 11:07:42] angelo: Yes, and you?
[01.12.21 11:07:45] hugo: Nope.
[01.12.21 11:07:50] hugo: I just got in.
[01.12.21 11:12:22] angelo: well, ask him, it's strange that he doesn't write in general chat about me about salary
[01.12.21 11:12:52] hugo: I texted france
[01.12.21 11:13:00] hugo: He's busy.
[01.12.21 19:22:53] hugo: I don't know whether to tell you or not
[01.12.21 19:23:07] angelo: You're a freaking idiot.
[01.12.21 19:23:12] angelo: Who starts off like that?)
[01.12.21 19:23:17] hugo: But I almost made my own coder)
[01.12.21 19:23:25] angelo: wow
[01.12.21 19:23:28] angelo: Holy shit
[01.12.21 19:23:44] angelo: well done!
[01.12.21 19:23:49] hugo: With open locked keys
[01.12.21 19:24:09] hugo: A little bit left, so I encrypt directories and watch
[01.12.21 19:24:34] angelo: it didn't take you long
[01.12.21 19:24:35] hugo: I still have to encrypt all drives and network folders
[01.12.21 19:25:02] hugo: Well a botnet would do that to itself
[01.12.21 19:25:16] hugo: And the encryption botnet doesn't need any panel as I found out
[01.12.21 19:25:35] hugo: + manuel said we don't have very good coders
[01.12.21 19:25:49] hugo: I think all customers don't mind the coder
[01.12.21 19:25:50] angelo: you mean locker now ?
[01.12.21 19:25:53] hugo: yes
[01.12.21 19:26:20] angelo: well, ours kind of worked fine, i don't know who's running the project for our locker
[01.12.21 19:26:50] hugo: Well, will I fail with the locker?)
[01.12.21 19:27:06] angelo: why ?
[01.12.21 19:27:10] angelo: you had a man there
[01.12.21 19:27:13] angelo: who's in the clear
[01.12.21 19:27:35] angelo: or you want to take him away?
[01.12.21 19:27:35] angelo: shoot
[01.12.21 19:27:46] hugo: I have a man?
[01.12.21 19:27:56] hugo: I want our customers in silence))
[01.12.21 19:27:56] angelo: you said you talked to a guy
[01.12.21 19:28:02] angelo: ah
[01.12.21 19:28:08] hugo: Maybe it's even ours
[01.12.21 19:28:09] angelo: but you understand it's a competitor ?
[01.12.21 19:28:28] hugo: Well, no one will notice))
[01.12.21 19:28:37] angelo: ahahahah ))
[01.12.21 19:28:41] angelo: joker
[01.12.21 19:29:07] angelo: what's the infra-structure at the locker ?
[01.12.21 19:29:23] angelo: just the coder itself ?
[01.12.21 19:29:30] hugo: Yeah, like a dll
[01.12.21 19:29:32] angelo: it's run through a bot in kobe
[01.12.21 19:29:39] hugo: It drops a manual onto the disk
[01.12.21 19:29:49] hugo: Like manuel said
[01.12.21 19:30:12] hugo: And according to the manual they find those who encrypted and negotiate
[01.12.21 19:30:26] angelo: I know a little about the subject
[01.12.21 19:30:33] angelo: communicated a little
[01.12.21 19:30:39] angelo: who works with coba
[01.12.21 19:30:46] angelo: and does it
[01.12.21 19:30:52] angelo: does not directly encrypt
[01.12.21 19:31:05] hugo: find out what they want
[01.12.21 19:31:18] hugo: To move me in that direction
[01.12.21 19:31:23] angelo: it's not easy
[01.12.21 19:31:30] hugo: otherwise i got tired of crypting out other people's locks)))
[01.12.21 19:31:36] angelo: ))
[01.12.21 19:31:42] angelo: but you won't offer ours?
[01.12.21 19:31:52] angelo: though yes
[01.12.21 19:31:55] hugo: Not officially.
[01.12.21 19:32:03] hugo: It's competition
[01.12.21 19:32:05] angelo: well, yeah, resono
[01.12.21 19:32:07] hugo: pure
[01.12.21 19:32:23] hugo: I want to make a better coder
[01.12.21 19:32:34] hugo: feel the ground what and how
[01.12.21 19:32:37] hugo: And shoot.
[01.12.21 19:32:53] angelo: you read how they work?
[01.12.21 19:32:55] angelo: these are groups
[01.12.21 19:33:02] hugo: Nope.
[01.12.21 19:33:03] angelo: lockers
[01.12.21 19:33:12] hugo: Tell me.
[01.12.21 19:33:24] hugo: Well I'll be for %
[01.12.21 19:33:48] angelo: cipher group is essentially the same group as ours, its own pentesters, its own negotiators
[01.12.21 19:33:51] angelo: their admins
[01.12.21 19:34:01] angelo: i.e. locker offers infrastructure
[01.12.21 19:34:09] angelo: from the client essentially hacking
[01.12.21 19:34:48] angelo: the locker takes care of it, it's not a separate encryptor itself
[01.12.21 19:35:00] angelo: you have to ask around
[01.12.21 19:35:08] angelo: it's just that this topic is not widely publicized
[01.12.21 19:35:38] angelo: not prohibited, but still
[01.12.21 19:36:23] angelo: myself would like to get into it, but I need knowledge of administering vin on a strong level (
[01.12.21 19:37:07] angelo: i think i'll talk, sorry i'm sick now, i feel like shit
[01.12.21 19:39:06] hugo: As I understand it, there is a dll which downloads and encrypts disks and then drops on disk instructions what to do to decrypt.
That is a person goes to the site, loads his encrypted key there and has a chance to decrypt 3 test files to make sure he's not being tricked.

Then he pays the ransom and they decrypt the key and give him a decryptor, which decrypts all the disks.
[01.12.21 19:40:17] hugo: The trick is that the process of decryptor issue can be automatized, the amount fell on bitcoin purse and key and decryptor were given automatically
[01.12.21 19:40:43] hugo: Ok get well
[01.12.21 19:41:34] angelo: how do I automate?
[01.12.21 19:47:17] hugo: Well the person goes to the site...
And sees the section download 3 files, he downloads 1 file and gets an unencrypted file.

Also on that site, there is a section to download the encrypted key with which the system was encrypted.

And a bitcoin wallet is issued, which is empty and waiting for refill by #$, as soon as the money came, the site gives the client a decrypted key.
And the decryptor itself can be downloaded at any time, as it is useless without this key.

The client downloads the decryptor and gives it the path to the key as a command line parameter.
Well, the system starts decrypting.
[01.12.21 19:48:15] hugo: There is no negotiation in this system
[01.12.21 19:48:23] hugo: Everything is automated
[01.12.21 19:48:36] hugo: You just need to infect the system and run it there
[01.12.21 19:48:40] angelo: interesting
[01.12.21 19:48:45] angelo: I have to
[01.12.21 19:48:49] hugo: That was my idea
[01.12.21 19:48:52] hugo: In theory
[01.12.21 19:49:07] angelo: Okay, I'll try to find out
[01.12.21 19:50:07] hugo: You just need to know what we're dealing with.
[01.12.21 19:50:22] hugo: This is just a tool for groups
[01.12.21 19:50:25] angelo: Need to know the background
[01.12.21 19:50:30] angelo: and figures
[01.12.21 19:50:31] hugo: yes
[01.12.21 19:50:48] hugo: Money is not important to me here.
[01.12.21 19:50:54] hugo: I wonder how it all works
[01.12.21 19:51:12] hugo: 10 lockers passed through me today))
[01.12.21 19:51:25] hugo: I'm drooling already))
[01.12.21 19:51:41] angelo: different ?
[01.12.21 19:51:45] angelo: hmm interesting
[01.12.21 19:52:11] angelo: testing new or something
[01.12.21 19:52:15] hugo: We have 1-2 lockers
[01.12.21 19:52:31] hugo: As manuel said from our and external coder
[01.12.21 19:52:41] hugo: Neither one nor the other never online
[01.12.21 19:52:48] hugo: So I would ask them myself
[01.12.21 19:53:01] angelo: I don't even know them(
[01.12.21 19:53:47] hugo: How's your band?
[01.12.21 19:54:08] hugo: Okay, you're sick.
[01.12.21 19:54:11] hugo: I'll go.
[01.12.21 19:54:14] hugo: Good night.
[01.12.21 19:54:20] angelo: Not bad.
[01.12.21 19:54:22] angelo: 38 bye
[01.12.21 19:54:30] angelo: a little shitty
[01.12.21 19:54:41] angelo: go ahead
[01.12.21 19:54:41] hugo: Go to sleep.
[01.12.21 19:54:44] angelo: good night
[01.12.21 19:54:49] angelo: go to bed.)
[02.12.21 14:38:01] hugo: Hi.
[02.12.21 14:38:07] hugo: Did you learn anything?
[02.12.21 16:36:45] hugo: Are you offended?)
[02.12.21 16:37:02] angelo: Hi.
[02.12.21 16:37:10] angelo: Damn, I wanted to answer and got pushed back.
[02.12.21 16:37:16] angelo: been sitting since 38 this morning
[02.12.21 16:37:26] angelo: My head don't feel good, but I gotta do stuff
[02.12.21 16:37:28] angelo: not yet.
[02.12.21 18:53:23] hugo: You think you can catch your breath?
[02.12.21 18:53:39] hugo: hahaa
[02.12.21 18:53:40] angelo: What do you mean?
[02.12.21 18:53:43] hugo: Rest.
[02.12.21 18:53:44] angelo: rest
[02.12.21 18:53:48] angelo: Aah!
[02.12.21 18:53:52] angelo: no
[02.12.21 18:53:57] angelo: I can't rest
[02.12.21 18:54:01] angelo: there's always work
[02.12.21 18:54:07] hugo: So the cuckoo will fly away))
[02.12.21 18:54:09] angelo: I'm sitting like shit
[02.12.21 18:54:29] angelo: you don't know how nervous customers are
[02.12.21 18:54:43] hugo: About what?
[02.12.21 18:54:49] angelo: Yeah.
[02.12.21 18:54:52] angelo: when they're waiting
[02.12.21 18:54:56] angelo: or something doesn't work
[02.12.21 18:55:04] angelo: I already wrote you about one dude
[02.12.21 18:55:08] hugo: What kind of clients are these days?
[02.12.21 18:55:09] angelo: how he talked to me
[02.12.21 18:55:19] angelo: i have two
[02.12.21 18:55:37] angelo: names won't get you anything
[02.12.21 18:55:38] hugo: And how do they work?
[02.12.21 18:55:42] hugo: Or rather, on what?
[02.12.21 18:55:47] angelo: everything.
[02.12.21 18:55:52] angelo: everything

1. DLL - a file which encrypts the system.
2. The site in torus, in which the dialogue and the output of the decryptor takes place.
[03.12.21 16:29:07] hugo: If so

[06.12.21 20:29:51] angelo: I got it.
[06.12.21 20:29:57] angelo: and then nothing.
[06.12.21 20:30:24] hugo: My goal is to get dough on a regular basis, but to do that I need to create something useful
[06.12.21 20:30:36] hugo: And that's hard
[06.12.21 20:30:43] angelo: You still need to work it out properly.
[06.12.21 20:30:48] hugo: It is.
[06.12.21 20:30:53] angelo: people have tools
[06.12.21 20:30:56] angelo: no result
[06.12.21 20:31:14] hugo: Well with coders just
[06.12.21 20:31:17] angelo: groups eat a lot of CP
[06.12.21 20:31:19] hugo: Encrypted and wait
[06.12.21 20:31:20] angelo: and everyone is waiting for luck
[06.12.21 20:31:29] angelo: well, they are waiting half a year)

[06.12.21 20:31:56] hugo: It happens.
[06.12.21 20:32:02] hugo: My business is to sell software
[06.12.21 20:32:07] hugo: Not fish.
[06.12.21 20:32:17] angelo: I don't know how to sell

[06.12.21 20:32:46] hugo: Well, the deposit, like an entrance ticket
[06.12.21 20:32:50] hugo: And then %
[06.12.21 20:33:16] hugo: Nobody will give out software in bulk
[06.12.21 20:33:22] hugo: Payment first
[06.12.21 20:33:27] hugo: As a threshold of entry
[06.12.21 20:33:33] hugo: So %
[06.12.21 20:33:40] angelo: I guess, I don't know (
[06.12.21 20:33:41] hugo: I think so.
[06.12.21 20:33:53] hugo: When are you gonna talk to the coders?
[06.12.21 20:34:11] angelo: i got a guy who tells me about %, and i think he got a lot of stuff through him and saw a fix very rarely
[06.12.21 20:34:19] angelo: don't know
[06.12.21 20:34:51] hugo: Okay, when you talk to me, let me know.

[07.12.21 13:49:33] angelo: you did it
[07.12.21 13:49:42] hugo: Then I switched to dll
[07.12.21 13:49:45] angelo: japanese mother
[07.12.21 13:49:48] angelo: got it
[07.12.21 13:49:55] hugo: because it is more ordered and easier to maintain
[07.12.21 13:50:32] angelo: I've been on ecz for who knows how long!)
[07.12.21 13:51:41] hugo: pulled as much as he could

[09.12.21 17:33:28] hugo: Okay.
[09.12.21 17:33:34] angelo: you need DllMain
[09.12.21 17:34:57] hugo: So DllMain is called by default

[10.12.21 11:34:46] angelo: I want it for me too
[10.12.21 11:34:54] hugo: That's right.
[10.12.21 11:35:00] angelo: I'm tired of saving
[10.12.21 11:35:19] angelo: And to limit yourself, you lose the sense in work
[10.12.21 11:35:45] hugo: Aerated concrete went up another 1000

[10.12.21 11:38:09] hugo: I'm not buying alone.
[10.12.21 11:38:21] hugo: 4k is roughly speaking for sweets))

[10.12.21 11:43:25] angelo: if only to return to the sea again
[10.12.21 11:43:46] angelo: I've been living in the countryside for many years, my soul can't bear it.)
[10.12.21 11:43:57] hugo: Why?
[10.12.21 11:45:30] angelo: you asked, I need movement, people, active life
[10.12.21 11:45:36] angelo: that's probably why
[10.12.21 11:45:55] angelo: if you live by the sea, it means surfing, biking, diving
[10.12.21 11:45:57] angelo: live
[10.12.21 11:46:25] angelo: you know "it doesn't matter how many days in your life, it matters how much life in your days"

[10.12.21 11:48:52] hugo: New houses))
[10.12.21 11:48:57] hugo: Logically))
[10.12.21 11:49:03] angelo: you'll be a slave to money
[10.12.21 11:49:10] angelo: 99% do that
[10.12.21 11:49:18] angelo: it's a cage
[10.12.21 11:49:19] hugo: We're all slaves of granny

[10.12.21 11:50:52] angelo: then what is the point?!
[10.12.21 11:51:06] angelo: after 30 the risk to die increases tremendously
[10.12.21 11:51:08] hugo: I'm not going to work
[10.12.21 11:51:14] angelo: not the point
[10.12.21 11:51:22] angelo: search, invest, control
[10.12.21 11:51:26] angelo: all this work
[10.12.21 11:51:40] hugo: All right
[10.12.21 11:53:05] angelo: it's like you have people, they work and watch you not doing a fucking thing, but you work - you make decisions, you solve problems, you get nervous, etc.
[10.12.21 11:53:30] angelo: i think i've tried everything in life already) it's easier for me to make a conclusion for myself
[10.12.21 11:54:04] hugo: I want to become independent of money
[10.12.21 11:54:27] hugo: And now I'm addicted like you
[10.12.21 11:54:36] hugo: To a lesser extent, but all
[10.12.21 11:54:36] hugo: same

[10.12.21 12:05:27] angelo: It's so well received
[10.12.21 12:05:30] angelo: but once you watch it, that's it
[10.12.21 12:05:37] angelo: you've ruined your own buzz
[10.12.21 12:06:04] hugo: Yeah.
[10.12.21 12:06:14] hugo: I used to watch soap operas.
[10.12.21 12:06:21] hugo: You're getting old.
[10.12.21 12:06:28] hugo: And now there's only one job.)
[10.12.21 12:06:35] hugo: Oh, this collar.)

[14.12.21 18:57:32] angelo: I laughed to be honest.)
[14.12.21 18:57:55] hugo: "crypto dll - it's a perversion", "I stopped making exe's because they get so dirty".
[12/14/221 18:58:09] hugo: these are my lines
[14.12.21 18:58:11] angelo: your words 7)

[14.12.21 18:58:41] hugo: And fine me for money
[14.12.21 18:58:45] hugo: I can feel it in my ass
[14.12.21 18:59:04] angelo: and you will humiliate yourself like this?
[14.12.21 18:59:09] angelo: does it hurt you so much ?
[12/14/21 18:59:14] hugo: No.
[14.12.21 18:59:18] hugo: I don't care.
[14.12.21 18:59:22] angelo: It hurts, but nobody's trying to humiliate you.
[14.12.21 18:59:38] hugo: And there's nothing to humiliate you with.)
[14.12.21 18:59:41] angelo: Kermit is sharp at best
[14.12.21 19:00:04] hugo: I wouldn't want to get fined
[14.12.21 19:00:22] hugo: I gotta hurry up and make the locker and get out of here))
[14.12.21 19:01:19] hugo: I feel a noose around my neck and it's slowly tightening
[14.12.21 19:01:40] angelo: you're too bored
[14.12.21 19:01:44] angelo: and you're having second thoughts
[14.12.21 19:01:47] angelo: here's about leo
[14.12.21 19:01:57] angelo: we needed bots
[14.12.21 19:02:15] angelo: urgently, and kryptor (I dunno just supposing) refuses saying I don't do such things
[14.12.21 19:02:33] angelo: client starts losing bots
[14.12.21 19:02:41] angelo: we get fucked for it
[14.12.21 19:04:10] hugo: So I denied?
[14.12.21 19:04:17] hugo: Or did others refuse?
[14.12.21 19:04:25] angelo: I'm not talking about you now.
[14.12.21 19:04:32] angelo: I read the line about botLeo
[14.12.21 19:04:39] angelo: and assumed
[14.12.21 19:04:46] hugo: I didn't read about leo
[14.12.21 19:04:49] hugo: But I don't know.
[14.12.21 19:05:02] angelo: Imagine, you need to do a job, and the man refuses
[14.12.21 19:05:13] angelo: people suffer losses
[14.12.21 19:05:21] angelo: and it's not fucking 1K green
[14.12.21 19:05:30] angelo: what do you want to do?

[14.12.21 19:06:46] hugo: We're a couple of diggers
[14.12.21 19:06:53] hugo: And we all get fucked
[14.12.21 19:07:01] hugo: According to the manual.
[14.12.21 19:07:29] hugo: And someone can only do one position
[14.12.21 19:07:33] angelo: and orval what?
[14.12.21 19:07:36] angelo: he's a cryptor

[14.12.21 19:09:13] angelo: Oh, I'm so used to having immunity
[14.12.21 19:09:15] angelo: even on adam
[14.12.21 19:09:37] hugo: I told you, they are hard to maintain and there is almost no demand, that's why I make dll
[14.12.21 19:10:22] hugo: I'm told you're not up to the task
[14.12.21 19:10:32] hugo: And so on and so forth
[14.12.21 19:11:43] angelo: they're fucked up these days
[14.12.21 19:11:51] angelo: the build machine went crazy and everyone got fucked up
[14.12.21 19:11:59] angelo: used to

[14.12.21 19:12:12] hugo: I see.
[14.12.21 19:12:22] angelo: Alas, it's normal.
[14.12.21 19:12:28] angelo: Everybody's nervous.

[14.12.21 19:13:33] hugo: What did you tell him?
[14.12.21 19:13:53] hugo: Throw the bits, now speed up the process?))
[14.12.21 19:14:10] angelo: it's not uncommon.
[14.12.21 19:14:17] angelo: trust me, it's not easy to endure either
[14.12.21 19:14:21] angelo: yeah, dick
[14.12.21 19:14:24] angelo: they will
[14.12.21 19:14:29] angelo: no crypto

[14.12.21 19:14:54] angelo: )
[14.12.21 19:15:30] hugo: Then you need a different salary
[14.12.21 19:15:36] hugo: For moral damages.
[14.12.21 19:15:39] angelo: Here I sit
[14.12.21 19:15:42] angelo: I want to shit...]
[14.12.21 19:15:46] angelo: but I can't get away
[14.12.21 19:16:04] hugo: Take your laptop with you.
[14.12.21 19:19:28] angelo: I'm not sitting around
[14.12.21 19:19:34] angelo: I'm just trying to get things done.
[14.12.21 19:19:38] angelo: and there are always a lot of them
[14.12.21 19:19:43] angelo: you got my message?
[14.12.21 19:19:50] angelo: about cryptors
[14.12.21 19:20:09] angelo: there was a month of hell in the spring
[14.12.21 19:20:16] hugo: promptly?
[14.12.21 19:20:21] angelo: i almost gave up, even though he's a tough guy
[14.12.21 19:20:23] hugo: I can do half an hour.
[14.12.21 19:20:27] angelo: Well, it's a quick fix.
[14.12.21 19:20:31] hugo: You should enjoy the process))
[14.12.21 19:21:11] angelo: So.
[14.12.21 19:21:15] angelo: it was a month in the spring
[14.12.21 19:21:23] angelo: another would have freaked out
[14.12.21 19:21:25] hugo: I'm a pussycat))
[14.12.21 19:21:31] angelo: trust me, you wouldn't have pulled that kind of pressure
[14.12.21 19:21:52] hugo: And you're still talking about work.
[14.12.21 19:22:20] angelo: I'm just trying to let you know that you're relaxed there, it's a sin to complain
[14.12.21 19:22:36] hugo: I agree.
[14.12.21 19:22:48] hugo: But when coders are pressured, it's even worse.
[14.12.21 19:23:03] hugo: That's why there's a slacker
[14.12.21 19:23:08] hugo: Slayer
[14.12.21 19:23:36] hugo: Just if you told the coder to do the faggot
[14.12.21 19:23:51] hugo: He'll say, fuck you, write to others
[14.12.21 19:23:57] hugo: Coders are proud
[14.12.21 19:24:38] hugo: When you get insulted, you have zero motivation to work
[14.12.21 19:25:13] hugo: Did you find out about the locker, by the way?
[14.12.21 19:25:27] angelo: about the locker, texted one hack, came up
[14.12.21 19:25:32] angelo: he even ignored the question
[14.12.21 19:25:35] angelo: honestly
[14.12.21 19:25:58] hugo: I also wanted to ask you, do you send files by the same links to the client or do you upload them again?
[14.12.21 19:27:09] angelo: What is it?
[14.12.21 19:27:35] angelo: I resend everything
[14.12.21 19:27:44] angelo: I rarely upload directly
[14.12.21 19:28:02] angelo: well, at least I need to check the output file
[14.12.21 19:28:32] hugo: I have an idea
[14.12.21 19:29:01] hugo: Create a simple exchanger and make a banner with locker ads below)))
[14.12.21 19:29:08] hugo: And give it all customers)))
[14.12.21 19:29:50] angelo: exchanger ?)
[14.12.21 19:29:53] hugo: Like this https://qaz.im/

[14.12.21 19:30:33] hugo: So as not to offer the client directly
[14.12.21 19:30:58] hugo: And hypo impose it all))
[14.12.21 19:30:58] angelo: the message is correct
[14.12.21 19:31:08] angelo: but I don't think it'll work
[14.12.21 19:31:15] angelo: I don't know.
[14.12.21 19:31:26] hugo: Why?
[14.12.21 19:31:32] hugo: Argue.
[14.12.21 19:31:47] angelo: Well, small-time suckers might pay attention.
[14.12.21 19:31:56] angelo: Our clients won't even bat an eye

[14.12.21 19:32:22] hugo: I haven't done anything yet.
[14.12.21 19:33:02] hugo: Good option is ours.
[14.12.21 19:33:05] hugo: But how?
[14.12.21 19:33:14] hugo: You can't offer them directly
[14.12.21 19:36:13] hugo: Are they fucking with you?
[14.12.21 19:46:02] angelo: Not directly.

[14.01.22 11:13:33] angelo: it works
[14.01.22 11:13:43] hugo: It's not working for me
[14.01.22 11:13:47] hugo: only exploit
[14.01.22 11:14:57] angelo: it's limping on half of them now
[19.01.22 12:23:22] hugo: hi

[19.01.22 12:24:14] angelo: 3 units
[19.01.22 12:24:22] hugo: and speed?
[19.01.22 12:24:28] hugo: What do you need 3 for?
[19.01.22 12:24:33] angelo: 3000-3500.
[19.01.22 12:24:39] angelo: 1 external
[19.01.22 12:24:46] angelo: there are two in the car
[19.01.22 12:24:59] angelo: do not use sdc
[19.01.22 12:25:06] hugo: yesterday i bought Samsung 1T 980 m2 3500/mb
[19.01.22 12:25:28] angelo: Why not a Proshka?
[19.01.22 12:25:32] angelo: or 970 pro
[19.01.22 12:25:36] angelo: better
[19.01.22 12:25:42] hugo: I have PCI3
[19.01.22 12:25:43] angelo: 970 plus
[19.01.22 12:25:55] hugo: Mother is old
[19.01.22 12:26:00] angelo: xc it's 4.0
[19.01.22 12:26:03] angelo: ?
[19.01.22 12:26:06] angelo: at 980
[19.01.22 12:26:06] hugo: Yeah.
[19.01.22 12:26:30] angelo: did it cut off too much?
[19.01.22 12:26:37] angelo: I also have 3.0
[19.01.22 12:26:40] hugo: If speed is more than 3.5, it's PCI4
[19.01.22 12:26:50] angelo: I know
[19.01.22 12:26:58] angelo: but it's not slow anyway
[19.01.22 12:27:24] angelo: don't worry
[19.01.22 12:27:25] hugo: And if I would buy it faster, then it would be stuck in PCI3
[19.01.22 12:27:39] hugo: I'm worried about something else.
[19.01.22 12:27:41] hugo: Look.
[19.01.22 12:28:17] hugo: Imagine in two minutes the cops come to you and start snotting the pc and you're not ready
[19.01.22 12:28:27] hugo: I'm thinking how to protect myself.
[19.01.22 12:28:32] hugo: And encrypt the data
[19.01.22 12:29:06] angelo: knowing our people, your broken fingers will quickly decode
[19.01.22 12:29:08] hugo: I put the whole system on a virtual machine and made it a single file, so you could stop and start encrypting right away
[19.01.22 12:29:16] angelo: or a baton wrapped with a rag
[19.01.22 12:29:28] angelo: no way
[19.01.22 12:29:29] angelo: don't be stupid
[19.01.22 12:29:33] angelo: who will come to you
[19.01.22 12:29:36] angelo: no reason
[19.01.22 12:29:49] hugo: need insurance
[19.01.22 12:29:52] hugo: parachute
[19.01.22 12:29:54] angelo: And you won't keep quiet, they're hurting you
[19.01.22 12:30:10] angelo: like you fell from the moon
[19.01.22 12:30:29] angelo: a couple of times in the throat, 5 minutes as a fish and you'll decipher
[19.01.22 12:30:49] hugo: You gotta make it look like nothing happened on the pc
[19.01.22 12:30:53] angelo: and it's not a ntv show
[19.01.22 12:30:54] hugo: Clean and beautiful
[19.01.22 12:31:10] angelo: You've never been in contact with the authorities
[19.01.22 12:31:16] angelo: Don't sweat it.
[19.01.22 12:31:22] angelo: Don't shit at home and you'll be fine
[19.01.22 12:31:38] angelo: and the scapegoat will always be a lowlife like me
[19.01.22 12:32:27] angelo: your fears are unfounded, there's even a faction that didn't take revils
[19.01.22 12:32:51] hugo: In the future, I will sell the coder and provide affiliate links
[19.01.22 12:32:54] hugo: That's why I think
[19.01.22 12:33:24] angelo: your best defense is confidence not in cis and ru
[19.01.22 12:33:35] angelo: that's the best there is
[19.01.22 12:34:28] hugo: CIS?
[19.01.22 12:34:36] hugo: Where is that?
[19.01.22 12:34:52] hugo: Did it help ReVill?
[19.01.22 12:35:00] angelo: were they taken ?
[19.01.22 12:35:13] angelo: CIS well our partner countries were in USSR
[19.01.22 12:35:39] hugo: I see
[19.01.22 12:35:53] angelo: The dodgers from the reports are not them
[19.01.22 12:35:55] hugo: It was on the news
[19.01.22 12:36:03] hugo: And a lot of money
[19.01.22 12:36:26] angelo: that's why you need a communication skill, living in society you can't withdraw into yourself.
[19.01.22 12:36:35] angelo: a lot? no kidding
[19.01.22 12:36:38] angelo: spear
[19.01.22 12:37:06] angelo: one stick had 20 billion bucks from k division in cash
[19.01.22 12:37:16] angelo: and here's a group with revenues of 50 million bucks a year
[19.01.22 12:37:33] angelo: he had rubles, not bucks
[19.01.22 12:37:40] angelo: they're bullshitting like they're breathing
[20.01.22 15:06:35] hugo: did you write back to french?
[20.01.22 15:07:17] angelo: on the salary ?
[20.01.22 15:07:20] angelo: Mm-hmm.
[20.01.22 15:17:07] hugo: But I do not)
[20.01.22 15:27:18] angelo: why ?
[20.01.22 15:27:35] hugo: He's not available
[20.01.22 15:27:53] hugo: Not responding yet
[20.01.22 15:28:00] hugo: There's a big payroll
[20.01.22 15:28:09] hugo: I don't know how you got in
[20.01.22 15:33:22] angelo: any luck ever)
[20.01.22 15:34:46] angelo: although i cashed out (
[20.01.22 15:35:07] hugo: I cash everything
[20.01.22 15:35:30] hugo: Otherwise the bit will fall and you will have no money
[21.01.22 10:57:43] hugo: You should have taken your money out, you would have been left without it))
[21.01.22 10:58:40] angelo: Pfft!
[21.01.22 10:58:47] angelo: You know you can't always win
[21.01.22 10:58:54] angelo: it's okay to lose too
[21.01.22 10:59:11] angelo: when i was older than you not much
[21.01.22 10:59:27] angelo: i lost 70K zelen at the current exchange rate
[21.01.22 10:59:40] angelo: no, about 60
[21.01.22 10:59:52] angelo: it's experience, life
[21.01.22 11:00:01] angelo: there's nothing wrong with it
[21.01.22 11:00:37] angelo: but I learned to take it easy with nobody
[21.01.22 11:01:04] hugo: You must minimize your losses
[21.01.22 11:01:10] hugo: not to increase them
[21.01.22 11:03:42] angelo: yes it is, but you have to take risks too
[21.01.22 11:03:53] angelo: sure, under certain conditions
[21.01.22 11:04:22] angelo: risk must be justified
[21.01.22 11:04:33] angelo: one guy with 5K made 1500000 for half a year
[21.01.22 11:04:47] angelo: lucky
[21.01.22 11:05:04] angelo: there was 350 thousand on the card, not a lot of money
[21.01.22 11:05:10] angelo: but the sum met all expectations
[21.01.22 11:05:17] hugo: No need to rely on luck
[21.01.22 11:05:31] angelo: why?
[21.01.22 11:05:36] angelo: no luck
[21.01.22 11:05:37] angelo: but chance
[21.01.22 11:05:49] angelo: chance, random basically determines our life
[21.01.22 11:06:25] angelo: and your actions are nothing more than a boat floating along a waterfall
[21.01.22 11:06:37] angelo: understand?
[21.01.22 11:06:49] hugo: I'm wixing money
[21.01.22 11:07:02] hugo: fixing
[21.01.22 11:07:06] angelo: well, i'm not even talking about money anymore )
[21.01.22 11:07:13] angelo: but in general
[21.01.22 11:07:23] hugo: About the zoo))
[21.01.22 11:08:01] angelo: After 30 you're already in the risk zone in our country
[21.01.22 11:08:21] angelo: that's why a rational approach has a very short term
[21.01.22 11:08:25] hugo: In the risk zone?
[21.01.22 11:08:29] angelo: yes
[21.01.22 11:08:33] hugo: I'm in the risk zone every day
[21.01.22 11:08:38] angelo: heart attack/stroke/cancer
[21.01.22 11:08:47] angelo: these are now diseases of the young
[21.01.22 11:09:13] angelo: don't want to die knowing I lived rationally
[21.01.22 11:09:16] angelo: 100%
[21.01.22 11:09:36] angelo: this coming from the man who takes 50% of salary]
[21.01.22 11:10:17] angelo: believe in the best, but don't forget, there may be no tomorrow
[21.01.22 11:10:33] angelo: And let's say you didn't do what you wanted. You didn't hook up with a girl.
[21.01.22 11:10:41] angelo: didn't get what you wanted
[21.01.22 11:10:44] hugo: That's the way)
[21.01.22 11:10:50] angelo: I'm sorry

[21.01.22 11:11:42] angelo: good thing i have my own philosophy and there's nothing there.)
[21.01.22 11:11:59] hugo: Died and was born again
[21.01.22 11:12:04] hugo: You can check
[21.01.22 11:12:08] hugo: But I wouldn't advise it.
[21.01.22 11:12:23] angelo: come on, there's no reason to believe it
[21.01.22 11:12:26] angelo: faith
