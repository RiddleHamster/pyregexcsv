2020-09-25T10:07:02 azot -> bentley
hi

2020-09-25T10:07:14 azot -> bentley
need details

2020-09-25T10:14:10 bentley -> azot
Hi, 30 minutes, I'll write back.

2020-09-25T11:40:40 bentley -> azot
I have a few questions for you

2020-09-25T11:49:25 azot -> bentley
I'll try to answer

2020-09-25T11:50:12 bentley -> azot
I'm interested in the time zone where you live

2020-09-25T11:51:12 azot -> bentley
+3

2020-09-25T11:51:59 bentley -> azot
On the work schedule, how's yours?

2020-09-25T11:52:07 bentley -> azot
What time do you have now?

2020-09-25T11:55:00 azot -> bentley
I have a lot of time now, 6-10 hours a day

2020-09-25T11:58:00 bentley -> azot
So that's good.

2020-09-25T12:00:29 azot -> bentley
It's good to have clarity

2020-09-25T12:01:13 bentley -> azot
Is it +3 to Moscow time?

2020-09-25T12:02:10 azot -> bentley
+3 it's Moscow time for me

2020-09-25T12:02:19 azot -> bentley
That is, I have the Moscow region

2020-09-25T12:02:32 bentley -> azot
Got it

2020-09-25T12:02:55 bentley -> azot
Making you a working VM. Have you ever dealt with virtuals?

2020-09-25T12:03:27 azot -> bentley
no

2020-09-25T12:03:43 bentley -> azot
What about the computer?

2020-09-25T12:04:10 azot -> bentley
Currently trying to put linux and deal with it

2020-09-25T12:04:20 azot -> bentley
I was installing virtual machines

2020-09-25T12:04:28 azot -> bentley
To use Ubuntu

2020-09-25T12:04:28 bentley -> azot
We have mostly wine at work

2020-09-25T12:05:00 azot -> bentley
I put it for general familiarization, learning sql

2020-09-25T12:05:17 azot -> bentley
That is, the knowledge is superficial.

2020-09-25T12:05:19 bentley -> azot
Got it so there is a basic understanding. The idea is that you will have 3 working VMs 7 10 2019 to test the performance of the files

2020-09-25T12:05:38 bentley -> azot
They will need to be updated every day and take snapshots.

2020-09-25T12:06:08 bentley -> azot
Well, and after running and working through the file - roll back to the last snap.

2020-09-25T12:06:44 bentley -> azot
There is a set of working tools: cryptopanel accesses to the admins, where the bots knock.

2020-09-25T12:07:39 azot -> bentley
+- clear

2020-09-25T12:07:49 azot -> bentley
there is a question, the main one.

2020-09-25T12:07:56 bentley -> azot
Go to

2020-09-25T12:08:03 azot -> bentley
why the cipher

2020-09-25T12:08:08 azot -> bentley
risks

2020-09-25T12:08:48 bentley -> azot
Work on testing viruses and backdoors. The gray side of the computer world.

2020-09-25T12:09:12 azot -> bentley
already familiarized with pentesting on the hubra

2020-09-25T12:09:32 bentley -> azot
If that doesn't scare you, you can continue )

2020-09-25T12:10:25 azot -> bentley
scare at school, but here you need to understand the actual risks

2020-09-25T12:10:37 azot -> bentley
but I agree.

2020-09-25T12:11:11 bentley -> azot
There is no risk. So the ac here doesn't have to spread anything around on its own. It's like a digital weapons training job

2020-09-25T12:11:53 bentley -> azot
Tetcitrating on certain parameters, and issuing partners working software.

2020-09-25T12:13:12 azot -> bentley
What is the real cache on hand?

2020-09-25T12:14:06 bentley -> azot
1000$ a month salary to start with. Further there is the possibility of growth.

2020-09-25T12:14:36 bentley -> azot
It's all in bucks here ))) I'm not afraid of the inflation of the wood ))))

2020-09-25T12:15:57 azot -> bentley
I would say that I would think about it, but they obviously won't take me to Sbertekh, and I need cash and experience.

2020-09-25T12:16:29 bentley -> azot
What's the hesitation?

2020-09-25T12:17:18 azot -> bentley
illegality doesn't scare you away, but it doesn't attract you either

2020-09-25T12:17:29 azot -> bentley
not to get in, but that's okay.

2020-09-25T12:17:59 azot -> bentley
I actually have to test how the virus works before using it and screen how the system reacts ?

2020-09-25T12:18:08 bentley -> azot
That's why it's encrypted, to keep it out.

2020-09-25T12:18:47 bentley -> azot
Test - yes according to a certain algorithm

2020-09-25T12:19:18 bentley -> azot
+ reports. + work with coders and partners

2020-09-25T12:20:38 azot -> bentley
Let's do it this way, I think I agree, we are not sitting in the states

2020-09-25T12:21:08 bentley -> azot
Ok think about it. Knock if you're here on Monday. I'll be here from 10msk.

2020-09-25T12:21:21 azot -> bentley
ok

2020-09-28T07:30:00 azot -> bentley
hi

2020-09-28T07:32:19 bentley -> azot
hi

2020-09-28T07:33:41 azot -> bentley
Are you here ?

2020-09-28T07:34:07 bentley -> azot
Yep

2020-09-28T07:34:14 bentley -> azot
What do you think?

2020-09-28T07:34:18 bentley -> azot
With us?

2020-09-28T07:34:58 azot -> bentley
yes

2020-09-28T07:35:07 azot -> bentley
sure I won't let my family down ?

2020-09-28T07:35:16 bentley -> azot
yes

2020-09-28T07:35:16 bentley -> azot
sure I won't let my family down ?

2020-09-28T07:35:40 azot -> bentley
Need cache and knowledge

2020-09-28T07:36:14 bentley -> azot
Okay

2020-09-28T07:36:28 bentley -> azot
Question. Do you have your own normal computer?

2020-09-28T07:36:42 bentley -> azot
Deploy test vm or are you going to race ours?

2020-09-28T07:36:50 bentley -> azot
Question about the daily routine.

2020-09-28T07:37:20 azot -> bentley
I have an A10 atlone machine, I don't know about the load to be honest

2020-09-28T07:37:55 azot -> bentley
CPU is shit for the task

2020-09-28T07:38:12 azot -> bentley
What's the order of the day ?

2020-09-28T07:38:13 bentley -> azot
Ok. Then we make you a set of test cars.

2020-09-28T07:38:20 bentley -> azot
Hours of operation.

2020-09-28T07:38:45 azot -> bentley
when you need to voice

2020-09-28T07:39:16 bentley -> azot
10 to 20 Moscow time ideally

2020-09-28T07:41:08 azot -> bentley
5 days ?

2020-09-28T07:41:25 bentley -> azot
Yes

2020-09-28T07:41:37 azot -> bentley
I can make it to 20 later

2020-09-28T07:41:49 azot -> bentley
only up to 5 so far.

2020-09-28T07:41:49 bentley -> azot
Okay. Up to 22 is perfect.

2020-09-28T07:42:05 bentley -> azot
What did they say about the WH?

2020-09-28T07:42:06 azot -> bentley
You can not sleep perfectly at all, I regret it myself.

2020-09-28T07:42:15 bentley -> azot
That's a good one.

2020-09-28T07:42:28 azot -> bentley
They said a grand to start with.

2020-09-28T07:42:35 bentley -> azot
That's right

2020-09-28T07:42:49 azot -> bentley
This is no joke, I'm going to bed with bated breath, I wish I had more time to sleep.

2020-09-28T07:43:06 azot -> bentley
payment how many times ?

2020-09-28T07:43:18 bentley -> azot
I see. Then today we make working machines and give access to admins and redmine.

2020-09-28T07:43:26 bentley -> azot
2 times a month. 1 Ð¸ 15

2020-09-28T07:43:39 azot -> bentley
You have enough brains? I mean me

2020-09-28T07:44:03 bentley -> azot
Yes. The work to start with is simple but necessary. Testing files by algorithms.

2020-09-28T07:44:17 bentley -> azot
I was going to say tedious.

2020-09-28T07:44:31 azot -> bentley
I'm trying to figure out what and how to do with Rest and Json and my brain cracks and doesn't understand everything

2020-09-28T07:44:33 azot -> bentley
got it

2020-09-28T07:44:40 azot -> bentley
tedious job digging potatoes

2020-09-28T07:44:51 bentley -> azot
Well... Yes. And dumb.

2020-09-28T07:45:01 azot -> bentley
here you go

2020-09-28T07:45:28 azot -> bentley
communication only here ?

2020-09-28T07:45:47 bentley -> azot
Yes.

2020-09-28T07:45:51 azot -> bentley
is there an app counterpart for the bucket ?

2020-09-28T07:46:04 bentley -> azot
Yes.

2020-09-28T07:46:17 bentley -> azot
But from a computer is better. It's easier to transfer links.

2020-09-28T07:46:23 bentley -> azot
Knock on buza@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion

2020-09-28T07:46:27 bentley -> azot
For accesses.

2020-09-28T07:46:32 bentley -> azot
He's waiting.

2020-09-28T08:18:56 azot -> bentley
Already reading the documentation. Answer the question - for how long has the dig been running ?

2020-09-28T08:19:36 azot -> bentley
I didn't ask about the social package, I understand, I won't get it

2020-09-28T08:27:01 bentley -> azot
I've been working for a year. So yeah more than 10 years.

2020-09-28T08:29:14 azot -> bentley
how long does it take to increase cache exhaust ?

2020-09-28T08:30:08 bentley -> azot
2-3 months minimum of productive work.

2020-09-28T09:02:47 azot -> bentley
about how much works asked that in redmine records are not old

2020-09-28T09:03:21 bentley -> azot
Yes only recently began to systematize and make manuals

2020-09-28T09:12:42 azot -> bentley
Sorry for a million questions, don't want to interrupt, but still

2020-09-28T09:13:11 azot -> bentley
if for some reason you have to say goodbye like this, okay ?

2020-09-28T09:13:58 bentley -> azot
Yes

2020-09-28T09:14:05 bentley -> azot
It's good that you're asking questions.

2020-09-28T10:25:19 azot -> bentley
After reading all the available information, there are no fewer questions. The depth of knowledge required is off the charts

2020-09-28T10:26:52 bentley -> azot
That's good. I'll teach you everything - I'll tell you everything.

2020-09-28T10:27:28 bentley -> azot
Let's start with the first step. Let's make test cars and so step by step

2020-09-28T10:27:35 bentley -> azot
For all the basics.

2020-09-28T10:36:11 azot -> bentley
Being smarter than others is priceless

2020-09-28T10:36:41 azot -> bentley
to be clear about the time so as not to let the team down

2020-09-28T10:37:03 azot -> bentley
should be gone in a couple of hours today, there shouldn't be such gaps in the future

2020-09-28T10:37:04 bentley -> azot
I think you'll get the hang of it in a week.

2020-09-28T10:37:17 bentley -> azot
Good. They're still making cars anyway.

2020-09-28T13:25:56 azot -> bentley
Do you know how long to wait for the virtuals?

2020-09-28T13:26:53 bentley -> azot
Let me clarify.

2020-09-28T13:29:45 azot -> bentley
It's not that I insist, but getting me closer to the date of the reward should instill confidence

2020-09-28T13:30:20 bentley -> azot

Twr task is to update the os to 10 and 2019. Shut down the machines and do a new snapshot.

2020-09-28T15:25:00 azot -> bentley
series of dumb questions - how to get into the axis itself ?

2020-09-28T15:25:18 azot -> bentley
Seems like it's supposed to go in, but opens the netting

Yeah right now

I'll be there tomorrow at 10:00 to take the plunge then

2020-09-28T18:11:34 azot -> bentley
can you answer one question ?

2020-09-28T18:11:41 bentley -> azot
Come on by 10 of course

2020-09-28T18:11:47 bentley -> azot
Ask

2020-09-28T18:12:38 azot -> bentley
the other won't ask, I'll ask - why do you need IT amateurs? you know, there are a lot of charlatans nowadays

2020-09-28T18:13:00 bentley -> azot
I like your questions.

2020-09-28T18:13:02 bentley -> azot
))

2020-09-28T18:13:49 bentley -> azot
There's no need to be particularly clear about it. There is an algorithm of work and you have to do the work. Tesmt every day. Lots of tedious tests.

2020-09-28T18:14:16 bentley -> azot
Some people go further though. They start with tests, then write code, etc.

2020-09-28T18:14:31 bentley -> azot
Units. Of course

2020-09-28T18:19:11 azot -> bentley
Got it, a comprehensive answer that suits me just fine.

2020-09-28T18:19:19 azot -> bentley
I want to be one

2020-09-28T18:20:51 bentley -> azot
Well... easy enough entry into this field. Let's just say affordable.

2020-09-28T18:22:11 azot -> bentley
You have to start somewhere.

2020-09-28T18:22:38 bentley -> azot
Yes

2020-09-28T18:23:03 azot -> bentley
I was just about to start, after all you have a serious bug tracking, not for the knees so to speak

2020-09-28T18:23:14 azot -> bentley
already good

2020-09-28T18:23:17 bentley -> azot
There's a lot of room for growth. The main thing is to start, establish yourself as a person you can rely on, and then all roads are open.

2020-09-28T18:23:27 bentley -> azot
It's judged by deeds here.

2020-09-28T18:23:57 azot -> bentley
makes sense

2020-09-28T18:24:06 azot -> bentley
just say the word.

2020-09-28T18:24:19 azot -> bentley
Then I will be able to use my car to drive VMs ?

2020-09-28T18:24:27 azot -> bentley
or through you it's sad.

2020-09-28T18:24:40 bentley -> azot
almost all testers have their vm

2020-09-28T18:24:45 bentley -> azot
That's exactly why )

2020-09-28T18:24:52 bentley -> azot
3 cars quite

2020-09-28T18:25:03 bentley -> azot
Virtual box or vmvare

2020-09-28T18:25:47 azot -> bentley
And everything works without a trace ?

2020-09-28T18:27:01 azot -> bentley
thanks for the answers to the questions

2020-09-28T18:28:09 bentley -> azot
Yes there is especially no trace of the testing technology itself implies a reference to the test, its servers. We don't need to hack something. We need to check the serviceability of the software. And it works in a rather closed environment

2020-09-28T18:28:49 bentley -> azot
All the servers where the bots bitch are their own. Organizations. The abuses won't fly.

If a pintest, that's another matter.

2020-09-28T18:33:10 azot -> bentley
It's good when there's something to strive for and when they can give you the opportunity. Pinterest is a very interesting direction

2020-09-28T18:33:59 bentley -> azot
Yes master with testing. show yourself in action and brave the pintsters. We have a lot of people who need savvy people.

I go to properties/network

2020-09-29T07:45:52 azot -> bentley
don't know where to find the port

2020-09-29T07:46:24 azot -> bentley

You have to shut down the machine from startup and then snapshot it.

2020-09-29T07:53:11 azot -> bentley
So, if the snap is done can I delete ?

2020-09-29T07:53:43 bentley -> azot
Snap yes.

2020-09-29T08:23:47 azot -> bentley

2020-09-29T08:24:05 azot -> bentley
I think I need to turn on telemetry, but I'm not getting around to it.

2020-09-29T08:26:02 bentley -> azot
won't have to do

2020-09-29T08:26:27 bentley -> azot

will there be actions after snapshot and rollback ?

2020-09-29T08:43:09 azot -> bentley
and so cyclical ?

2020-09-29T08:43:32 bentley -> azot
Yes

2020-09-29T08:43:37 bentley -> azot
Worked - rolled back.

2020-09-29T08:44:26 azot -> bentley

No, I don't care about the end result

2020-09-29T08:46:36 azot -> bentley
exactly how the software will get on these three machines of mine

2020-09-29T08:46:45 bentley -> azot
Our task is to give out clean working software

2020-09-29T08:46:59 bentley -> azot
Yes exe and dll

2020-09-29T08:47:14 azot -> bentley
So I'll be pouring it myself?

2020-09-29T08:47:29 bentley -> azot
For the test, yes.

2020-09-29T08:48:03 azot -> bentley
got it

2020-09-29T08:48:03 bentley -> azot
I'll send it or you can take it to the coder for test - pass it to cryptor and cnv test and then send it to the partner with the password

2020-09-29T08:50:00 azot -> bentley
got it

2020-09-29T08:50:41 azot -> bentley
How is the transmission/communication with partner ?

2020-09-29T08:51:02 azot -> bentley
not out of curiosity, you know.

2020-09-29T08:51:16 bentley -> azot
They will then write to you in the toad and ask to make them a file

2020-09-29T08:52:28 azot -> bentley
I'm all about mine, defending my link in the transmission

2020-09-29T08:52:43 bentley -> azot
More details?

2020-09-29T08:53:27 azot -> bentley
I'm not just a file with an abstract, you know

2020-09-29T08:53:52 bentley -> azot
Yes. I understand. What's the question?

2020-09-29T08:55:03 azot -> bentley
I was exactly asking how I was going to pass it on, now I understand more or less

2020-09-29T08:55:25 bentley -> azot
Just send a link to the archive with the password from the file sharing site in the chat room

2020-09-29T08:55:30 bentley -> azot

2020-09-29T08:55:43 azot -> bentley
I'm not good at defense and can't accurately determine the degree of stealth of my car

2020-09-29T08:57:57 bentley -> azot

2020-09-29T09:05:10 bentley -> azot

2020-09-29T09:05:21 bentley -> azot

So after adding two files to the system bots start working ?

2020-09-29T10:12:30 bentley -> azot
Not really. After running the file on the system

2020-09-29T10:12:32 bentley -> azot
ec or dll

2020-09-29T10:12:44 bentley -> azot
bot is created in the admin panel

2020-09-29T10:12:58 bentley -> azot
Or a running file on the computer knocks into the admin area

2020-09-29T10:13:14 bentley -> azot

2020-09-29T10:59:47 bentley -> azot
make it work the way you want it to work

2020-09-29T11:01:22 azot -> bentley
So, what about the fact that the file was run without a snap

2020-09-29T11:02:17 bentley -> azot
rollback better do it all over again do a snap and only then upload the test file

2020-09-29T11:03:07 azot -> bentley
How to rollback? have not encountered

2020-09-29T11:07:11 bentley -> azot
It's simple, you stand on the last snap is above the resto button pressed. In the next window uncheck the box for sure! Ok

But it's okay, too )

I think if you collect all the updates from Windows it will take more than a month to get them.

2020-09-30T17:30:05 azot -> bentley
from Windows 95-98

2020-09-30T17:30:24 bentley -> azot
Yeah )

2020-09-30T17:30:32 bentley -> azot
But for 7 hours 2-3

2020-09-30T17:31:39 azot -> bentley
severely

2020-09-30T17:32:28 azot -> bentley

2020-09-30T17:48:05 bentley -> azot
Yep

2020-09-30T17:48:08 azot -> bentley
Tell me, is it true that Chrome is the most

2020-09-30T17:48:15 azot -> bentley
not a secure browser

2020-09-30T17:48:21 azot -> bentley
In terms of anonymity

well it's out of the question, it has only one function - to download another browser)

2020-09-30T17:50:12 azot -> bentley
Just read the text file on your server

2020-09-30T17:50:31 azot -> bentley

And you need to throw your smartphone in the microwave right away

2020-09-30T17:53:41 azot -> bentley
Sorry for my excessive talkativeness

2020-09-30T17:54:38 azot -> bentley
I am very inquisitive and meticulous

2020-09-30T17:54:39 bentley -> azot
Yeah, you're right about something. Samarth is a major nahrodka for google

2020-09-30T17:54:53 bentley -> azot
Is it true that a dossier on everyone is being collected

2020-09-30T17:55:15 azot -> bentley
And it will be like in the TV series Black Mirror

2020-09-30T17:55:33 azot -> bentley
Or as they already have in China - social rating

2020-09-30T17:55:58 azot -> bentley
The flip side of the technogenic world

2020-09-30T17:56:06 bentley -> azot
Yes or like in the TV series Wild West World

2020-09-30T17:56:12 azot -> bentley
oh yeah

2020-09-30T17:56:12 bentley -> azot
Yes total control

2020-09-30T17:57:38 azot -> bentley
and this is the main weapon in the hands of the state, that's what's scary

2020-09-30T17:59:44 bentley -> azot
yes and that's why hackers are growing in value so much over time ))

2020-09-30T18:00:05 azot -> bentley

Basically imitation of the boisterous activity for the posts vvk bend ))

2020-09-30T18:01:41 azot -> bentley
It's a holy thing to get an article for the right to say what you think on VK

2020-09-30T18:02:18 bentley -> azot
VK was originally a fsb shit like the trolley. The cart just doesn't stink as much yet.

2020-09-30T18:02:43 azot -> bentley
You mean that the whole Tlega is on the wire?

2020-09-30T18:02:56 azot -> bentley
And it's pale to use it ?

2020-09-30T18:02:57 bentley -> azot
Of course.

2020-09-30T18:03:05 bentley -> azot
If at all from the left ak

This is where the alternate network personality works. You make it yourself and you don't cross anywhere with the real one

2020-09-30T18:04:07 bentley -> azot
It's like us at toad: meaningless nicknames

2020-09-30T18:04:22 bentley -> azot
that no one has ever had before

2020-09-30T18:04:50 azot -> bentley

2020-09-30T18:06:08 bentley -> azot
I'm still dealing with it myself ) with the account ))

2020-09-30T18:06:18 azot -> bentley
I was thinking, what if the access is duplicated to another person ?

2020-09-30T18:06:31 bentley -> azot
not where the tipis sell themselves

2020-09-30T18:06:39 azot -> bentley
they throw you a thousand bucks normal

2020-09-30T18:06:41 azot -> bentley
2000 normal

2020-09-30T18:06:51 bentley -> azot
you do a 2-factor authorization on the left SIM and that's it )

2020-09-30T18:07:04 azot -> bentley
and then it's not you who withdraws the large amount

2020-09-30T18:07:06 azot -> bentley
hmm

2020-09-30T18:07:06 bentley -> azot
there's that too )

2020-09-30T18:08:12 azot -> bentley

2020-09-30T18:17:28 azot -> bentley
But I've never worked with the server wind, so I'm tired of googling how to disable sending from the defender

2020-09-30T18:17:51 azot -> bentley
and how to put chrome, but I think I did everything

2020-09-30T18:18:13 azot -> bentley
Sometimes you just think if you can't do these things right away, how can you do them next

Hi

2020-10-01T06:51:14 azot -> bentley
can you put a torrent on one machine ? or should they be as clean as the first snow ?

2020-10-01T06:53:38 bentley -> azot
Why torrent?

2020-10-01T06:54:58 azot -> bentley
Okay, let's see, how do you download the same office nowadays? Do you do an archive in the cloud and download from it?

2020-10-01T06:55:26 bentley -> azot
yes we can do it this way

2020-10-01T07:11:20 azot -> bentley
I'm downloading the English version.

2020-10-01T07:11:25 azot -> bentley
what's next

2020-10-01T07:24:20 bentley -> azot
Update all avs take snapshots and tell me to give out test files

2020-10-01T09:09:57 azot -> bentley

2020-10-01T09:10:59 bentley -> azot
no need to update

2020-10-01T09:23:56 azot -> bentley
so wait

2020-10-01T09:24:04 azot -> bentley
So should I update 7 or not?

2020-10-01T09:25:04 bentley -> azot
don't

2020-10-01T09:25:08 azot -> bentley
got it

2020-10-01T09:35:10 azot -> bentley
snaps made

2020-10-01T09:35:28 bentley -> azot
super

2020-10-01T09:35:33 azot -> bentley
By the way, I could not find an answer - snapshots are made only when the virtual machine is on?

2020-10-01T09:35:44 bentley -> azot
yes

2020-10-01T09:35:47 bentley -> azot
these are better

2020-10-01T10:12:41 azot -> bentley
I'm ready

2020-10-01T10:13:40 bentley -> azot
Cool

2020-10-01T10:13:43 bentley -> azot

Run it on all cars

2020-10-01T10:53:18 azot -> bentley
so tell me how easy it is to insert the link into the virtual machine

2020-10-01T10:53:28 azot -> bentley
it's not three characters.

2020-10-01T10:53:31 bentley -> azot
does copypaste not work for you?

2020-10-01T10:55:34 azot -> bentley
There is no connection between the computer and the virtual machine

2020-10-01T10:55:48 azot -> bentley
Should it be? I thought they had separate caches

2020-10-01T10:55:53 bentley -> azot
Look for link shortening services

2020-10-01T10:56:42 azot -> bentley
I'll make up my mind.

2020-10-01T11:05:33 azot -> bentley
Yes, there is an extra setting for buffer exchange

2020-10-01T11:05:44 azot -> bentley
Okay, there's a pixel.

2020-10-01T11:06:29 azot -> bentley
dumbly downloading or opening

2020-10-01T11:06:33 azot -> bentley
?

2020-10-01T11:07:03 bentley -> azot
yes but download from the link

2020-10-01T11:08:36 azot -> bentley
Sorry for being so dumb, but I don't want to break the algorithm and then roll back the system

2020-10-01T11:12:05 bentley -> azot
Yes, you download and run it.

2020-10-01T11:17:36 azot -> bentley
So, after running the file, what to do next ?

2020-10-01T11:18:22 bentley -> azot
Wait 20 minutes and see whether or not there is a detection on the av

2020-10-01T11:24:38 azot -> bentley
should the detector be automatic or check manually ?

2020-10-01T11:25:45 bentley -> azot
Yes it will appear as a notification by itself

2020-10-01T11:25:51 bentley -> azot
and look in the event viewer

2020-10-01T11:39:32 azot -> bentley
Too bad you can't close the window in virtual machines without shutting down the machine

2020-10-01T11:39:49 bentley -> azot
why?

2020-10-01T11:41:28 azot -> bentley
When you close the VM window, it gives you the choice to either go to sleep or shut down

2020-10-01T11:41:55 azot -> bentley
is it different for you ?

2020-10-01T11:42:08 bentley -> azot
which window exactly?

2020-10-01T11:42:09 azot -> bentley
I already googled it.

2020-10-01T11:42:41 azot -> bentley
virtual machine windows. That is, as long as the window with the windup (one of the three) is open, the machine works.

2020-10-01T11:43:03 azot -> bentley
close it and you either put it to sleep or turn it off

2020-10-01T11:43:15 bentley -> azot
Why are you closing it?

2020-10-01T11:43:34 azot -> bentley
can you open several at once ?

2020-10-01T11:43:38 azot -> bentley
does not load the system ?

2020-10-01T11:43:48 bentley -> azot
check out

2020-10-01T11:54:50 azot -> bentley
opens but seems to stress the system a lot, I'll try it this way.

2020-10-01T11:55:01 azot -> bentley
10 as ate

2020-10-01T11:55:05 azot -> bentley

2020-10-01T11:55:29 bentley -> azot
ok

2020-10-01T12:01:13 azot -> bentley
7 is ok

2020-10-01T12:18:30 azot -> bentley
Event Viewer is silent everywhere

2020-10-01T12:28:18 bentley -> azot
okay

2020-10-01T13:00:41 bentley -> azot
When you're done.

2020-10-01T13:00:42 bentley -> azot
 <bentley> Got a file to test

2020-10-01T13:02:00 azot -> bentley
To the first snap

2020-10-01T13:02:20 bentley -> azot
Yes

2020-10-01T13:02:25 bentley -> azot
No detects?

2020-10-01T13:02:35 azot -> bentley
wasn't

2020-10-01T13:02:40 bentley -> azot
great!

2020-10-01T14:06:25 azot -> bentley
so

2020-10-01T14:06:35 azot -> bentley
files are running but nothing happens

2020-10-01T14:06:46 azot -> bentley
It just freezes like it's loading.

2020-10-01T14:07:03 bentley -> azot
ok

2020-10-01T14:07:09 bentley -> azot
no bounce?

2020-10-01T14:07:26 azot -> bentley
nope

2020-10-01T14:07:58 azot -> bentley
i.e. i load a file and that's it, standby mode, so to speak, as if loading anything

2020-10-01T14:08:20 bentley -> azot
roll it back and redo it.

2020-10-01T14:21:04 azot -> bentley
7 doesn't respond at all

2020-10-01T14:28:50 bentley -> azot
Doesn't the vm work at all?

2020-10-01T14:30:01 azot -> bentley
no

2020-10-01T14:30:11 azot -> bentley
so

2020-10-01T14:30:23 azot -> bentley
Nothing happens after running the file

2020-10-01T14:30:34 azot -> bentley
That is, vm works normally without change

2020-10-01T14:30:45 bentley -> azot
ok

2020-10-01T14:31:02 azot -> bentley
I load the application and then nothing happens

2020-10-01T14:32:09 bentley -> azot
it should be

2020-10-01T14:33:01 azot -> bentley
10 second time similar

2020-10-01T14:33:26 bentley -> azot
it should be

2020-10-01T14:33:31 azot -> bentley
leave the cars to work?

2020-10-01T14:37:05 bentley -> azot
yes

2020-10-01T14:39:17 azot -> bentley
I will be able to test the server after, only two virtual machines can work at the same time

2020-10-01T14:39:20 azot -> bentley
is not pulling

2020-10-01T14:39:29 bentley -> azot
clearly

2020-10-01T14:40:22 azot -> bentley
I'll have to put it on another computer, where there is more memory

2020-10-01T15:26:10 azot -> bentley
The cars all work fine

2020-10-01T15:27:17 azot -> bentley
what to do next ?

2020-10-01T15:28:12 bentley -> azot

2020-10-01T16:59:52 azot -> bentley
there is no such card

2020-10-01T17:00:00 azot -> bentley

2020-10-02T07:43:30 azot -> bentley
tell me seven all intends to update, what to do with it

2020-10-02T07:43:49 bentley -> azot
Cut off her fucking upgrades

2020-10-02T07:46:00 azot -> bentley
Do I understand correctly that after upgrading new at 10 and 19 you need to do a snap

2020-10-02T07:46:12 bentley -> azot
right

2020-10-02T07:46:28 bentley -> azot
After any changes. When you add something.

2020-10-02T07:46:42 bentley -> azot
But after running the files always roll back to a clean snap

2020-10-02T07:48:55 azot -> bentley
let me explain again: the machine for the test should always be clean (but with chrome and archiver installed) and with the latest updates to roll back to it later

2020-10-02T07:48:58 bentley -> azot
what version of the baz av def do you have?

2020-10-02T07:49:09 bentley -> azot
right!

2020-10-02T07:49:23 bentley -> azot
+ Def updates. They come every 3-5 hours

2020-10-02T07:49:59 azot -> bentley
Now comes the update maiden and say

2020-10-02T07:50:06 bentley -> azot

Me too. ok.

2020-10-02T07:52:50 azot -> bentley
if you have time tell me why 7 is so demanding, what's wrong with it

2020-10-02T08:05:53 azot -> bentley
immediately roll back or let it work

2020-10-02T08:06:39 bentley -> azot
let it work

2020-10-02T08:07:11 bentley -> azot
you don't need to do anything with the file, just check that it is running in the task manager

2020-10-02T08:07:22 bentley -> azot

2020-10-02T08:07:25 bentley -> azot

2020-10-02T08:58:17 bentley -> azot
No, you have to go into the bot to make a request and wait for the result.

2020-10-02T08:59:05 bentley -> azot
requests: Get_SystemImf, Run_ex, Run_Dll, Run_bar, Run_Powershel

2020-10-02T09:01:50 bentley -> azot

2020-10-02T09:13:46 bentley -> azot

2020-10-02T09:14:18 azot -> bentley
Okay, I think I got it.

2020-10-02T09:14:45 azot -> bentley
That is, until the file is tapped by bots, nothing happens

2020-10-02T09:15:08 bentley -> azot
Yes, until it appears in the admin area as a bot nothing can be done

2020-10-02T09:15:19 azot -> bentley

2020-10-02T12:35:24 bentley -> azot
as you download

2020-10-02T13:02:57 azot -> bentley
Did it take you long to get into the subject ?

2020-10-02T13:03:02 azot -> bentley
the process is not simple

2020-10-02T13:03:30 bentley -> azot
Yeah 1-2 months. Slowly going in.

2020-10-02T13:03:59 azot -> bentley
lucky to have a new testing plan now

2020-10-02T13:04:05 azot -> bentley
the old one is even more complicated

2020-10-02T13:06:04 azot -> bentley
so firstly

2020-10-02T13:06:22 azot -> bentley
logged not logged and 86 with 64

2020-10-02T13:06:29 bentley -> azot
yes

2020-10-02T13:06:31 azot -> bentley
are those 4 different ones?

2020-10-02T13:06:43 azot -> bentley
kits

2020-10-02T13:07:03 bentley -> azot
Yes 1 with logs 1 without and plus different versions of 32 and 64 bits

2020-10-02T13:10:11 azot -> bentley
How to understand the resident loader

2020-10-02T13:10:54 bentley -> azot
it means lives in the memory all the time

2020-10-02T13:11:05 bentley -> azot
and after restarting.

2020-10-02T13:13:15 azot -> bentley
This is much more interesting than I thought

2020-10-02T15:10:14 azot -> bentley
You know how much you can read and not just

2020-10-02T15:10:39 azot -> bentley
Here you need to bring the algorithm to automatism

2020-10-02T15:50:16 bentley -> azot
yes it will

2020-10-02T16:42:37 azot -> bentley
are you there ?

2020-10-02T16:42:42 azot -> bentley
all good ?

2020-10-02T16:43:16 bentley -> azot
Yes, I'll deal with the virtual machine and we'll continue

2020-10-02T16:45:34 bentley -> azot
do you have a group 7 in Groups ?

2020-10-02T16:49:23 azot -> bentley
5 min give

2020-10-02T16:49:37 bentley -> azot
Draw it when you're ready.

2020-10-02T17:14:44 azot -> bentley
so here

2020-10-02T17:15:02 azot -> bentley
Sorry for the distraction.

2020-10-02T17:15:09 bentley -> azot
Norm

2020-10-02T17:15:16 bentley -> azot
You need to run the test file

2020-10-02T17:15:26 azot -> bentley
come on

2020-10-02T17:15:34 azot -> bentley

2020-10-02T17:18:59 azot -> bentley
I already asked, but I'll say it again.

2020-10-02T17:19:09 azot -> bentley
snaps are done only when the machine is on ?

2020-10-02T17:19:40 bentley -> azot
Off is better.

2020-10-02T17:20:02 azot -> bentley
It's even better, it's faster.

Waiting to see how your vm cools down

2020-10-02T17:30:09 azot -> bentley
are we going to see this in the groups ?

2020-10-02T17:30:43 bentley -> azot
We will see eotstuk in Bots either Test Bots or Honeypots

2020-10-02T17:31:02 bentley -> azot
in the future you will pour backdoors and loaders into groups

2020-10-02T17:35:24 azot -> bentley
there was some kind of cliff in the toad

2020-10-02T17:35:33 bentley -> azot
Yep

2020-10-02T17:35:38 bentley -> azot
What's your ipi?

2020-10-02T17:35:39 azot -> bentley
by what criterion are we going to define our bot ?

2020-10-02T17:35:47 azot -> bentley
By the way I have a very important question

2020-10-02T17:35:50 bentley -> azot
IP and computer name

2020-10-02T17:35:57 bentley -> azot
either this or that

2020-10-02T17:36:02 azot -> bentley
You never know what's going to happen to a toad.

2020-10-02T17:36:05 azot -> bentley
well dunno

2020-10-02T17:36:15 azot -> bentley
anything, there will be no contact how to be ?

2020-10-02T17:36:41 bentley -> azot
get yourself a second toad on the open server

2020-10-02T17:36:41 azot -> bentley
it sometimes behaves unstable

2020-10-02T17:36:46 bentley -> azot
Give me a contact, too.

2020-10-02T17:36:56 azot -> bentley
ok

2020-10-02T17:37:01 bentley -> azot
I'll add you to my public toad

2020-10-02T17:37:24 azot -> bentley
ok I will

2020-10-02T17:38:42 azot -> bentley
199.249.230.118

2020-10-02T17:39:11 bentley -> azot
I'll explain how I'm looking for

2020-10-02T17:39:25 bentley -> azot
go into bots and see if it's not your ipi

2020-10-02T17:41:21 azot -> bentley
Or rather he, we need the ipi of the vm

2020-10-02T17:41:32 bentley -> azot
yes

2020-10-02T17:41:40 azot -> bentley
185.104.185.87

2020-10-02T17:41:55 bentley -> azot
see if it's not there?

2020-10-02T17:42:24 azot -> bentley
no bots

2020-10-02T17:43:08 azot -> bentley
definitely not

2020-10-02T17:43:25 bentley -> azot
see

2020-10-02T17:43:35 bentley -> azot
you can sample by ipi

2020-10-02T17:43:55 bentley -> azot
Where it says ipi in red at the top, there is a blank field below it

2020-10-02T17:44:09 bentley -> azot
enter your ipi there and press inter

2020-10-02T17:44:15 azot -> bentley

filter

2020-10-02T17:44:29 bentley -> azot
yes

2020-10-02T17:45:35 bentley -> azot
so do it with the three tabs bots honeypots Test Bots

2020-10-02T17:47:35 azot -> bentley
definitely not

2020-10-02T17:48:06 azot -> bentley
double-checked the ipi

2020-10-02T17:48:35 bentley -> azot
Try searching by computer name as well

2020-10-02T17:50:05 azot -> bentley
ok

2020-10-02T17:54:33 bentley -> azot
Did you find it?

2020-10-02T17:55:02 azot -> bentley
nope

2020-10-02T17:55:08 azot -> bentley
I'm getting dumb somewhere.

2020-10-02T17:55:17 azot -> bentley
although the task is much simpler

2020-10-02T17:55:17 bentley -> azot
Or the bot doesn't knock

2020-10-02T17:57:00 azot -> bentley
No, it's not.

2020-10-02T17:57:23 bentley -> azot
What is the name of the computer that is in VM?

2020-10-02T17:57:32 azot -> bentley
DESKTOP-2KDN5AK

2020-10-02T17:59:45 azot -> bentley
the manual seems to mention that the bot may not knock

2020-10-02T18:00:27 bentley -> azot
and I see in the test bots

2020-10-02T18:00:37 bentley -> azot
Yes he can, but he's off.

2020-10-02T18:01:18 bentley -> azot
believe me when you put in the filter window so that in front of the letters and after not a block space for this search is cretic

2020-10-02T18:01:38 azot -> bentley
how ?

2020-10-02T18:01:46 azot -> bentley
searched by name ?

2020-10-02T18:02:05 bentley -> azot
yes

2020-10-02T18:03:30 azot -> bentley
I checked the indentation first of all

2020-10-02T18:03:30 azot -> bentley
Doesn't find it for me

2020-10-02T18:04:27 azot -> bentley
Is this ipi what I wrote ?

2020-10-02T18:04:58 bentley -> azot
no

2020-10-02T18:05:17 bentley -> azot

where am i wrong ?

2020-10-02T18:07:34 bentley -> azot
Isn't the ipi with a space?

2020-10-02T18:07:44 azot -> bentley
no

2020-10-02T18:07:55 bentley -> azot
strange

2020-10-02T18:08:30 azot -> bentley
I should be able to do the search.

here he is

2020-10-02T18:09:03 bentley -> azot
check again that there are no spaces in front and behind the characters

2020-10-02T18:09:41 azot -> bentley
Your link leads to the main one, no more

2020-10-02T18:09:58 bentley -> azot
Ahh. I see what's going on.

2020-10-02T18:10:27 bentley -> azot
bot knocked group One1 and you do not have access to it and you do not see it therefore!

2020-10-02T18:10:33 bentley -> azot
How about that!

2020-10-02T18:10:40 azot -> bentley
here we go

2020-10-02T18:10:52 azot -> bentley
I already thought that the filter is beyond my mind

2020-10-02T18:10:56 bentley -> azot
figured it out!

2020-10-02T18:11:34 azot -> bentley
Well, that's good.

2020-10-02T18:11:38 bentley -> azot
Waiting to see if he sucks.

2020-10-02T18:11:55 azot -> bentley
what kind of band is this

2020-10-02T18:12:02 azot -> bentley
And why no access

2020-10-02T18:12:25 bentley -> azot
it is a group of vip partner he forbids all to look there

2020-10-02T18:12:47 azot -> bentley
will knock it out means online yes ?

2020-10-02T18:12:54 bentley -> azot
yes

2020-10-02T18:13:27 azot -> bentley
partner of the one to whom the file with the loafer goes later on?

2020-10-02T18:13:39 azot -> bentley
after the encryption

2020-10-02T18:14:09 bentley -> azot
After crypto.

2020-10-02T18:14:10 bentley -> azot
Yes

2020-10-02T18:14:29 azot -> bentley
Well, yes, my vocabulary is poor so far, but it's a matter of time.

2020-10-02T18:14:51 bentley -> azot
Well... There's a slang for it like in any other business ))

2020-10-02T18:15:00 azot -> bentley
no argument

2020-10-02T18:15:13 azot -> bentley
and what do you see in the group ?

2020-10-02T18:15:34 azot -> bentley
sorry for the questions, I like to have a picture in my head

2020-10-02T18:15:48 azot -> bentley
it's easier to understand

2020-10-02T18:15:53 bentley -> azot
all right ask me lots of questions

2020-10-02T18:15:58 bentley -> azot
while the bot is offline

2020-10-02T18:16:10 azot -> bentley
I finally have somewhere I can do this without being judged)

2020-10-02T18:16:20 bentley -> azot
Sure )))

2020-10-02T18:16:41 bentley -> azot
It's not shameful to ask anyone.

2020-10-02T18:16:41 azot -> bentley
Your patience is the envy of me

2020-10-02T18:17:04 azot -> bentley
there are no stupid questions - there are stupid answers

2020-10-02T18:18:02 azot -> bentley
after bouncing commands start ?

2020-10-02T18:18:14 bentley -> azot
right

2020-10-02T18:20:30 bentley -> azot
I got the idea.

2020-10-02T18:20:34 bentley -> azot
let's do it this way.

2020-10-02T18:20:57 bentley -> azot
roll back all machines and change each computer name and then snap

2020-10-02T18:21:05 bentley -> azot
and try for at least 1

2020-10-02T18:21:13 bentley -> azot
Should be knocking on the other bot

2020-10-02T18:21:24 bentley -> azot
Let's do that to Y

2020-10-02T18:21:35 bentley -> azot
from the 1st

2020-10-02T18:21:46 bentley -> azot
name it so that you can immediately recognize it in the list

2020-10-02T18:24:12 azot -> bentley
let me roll one, it will be faster and we will test it

2020-10-02T18:24:29 bentley -> azot
Let's go for 1 yes

2020-10-02T18:24:49 azot -> bentley
with the same file ?

2020-10-02T18:24:58 bentley -> azot
yes

2020-10-02T18:25:39 azot -> bentley
You should definitely change the car, so it would be faster

2020-10-02T18:25:49 azot -> bentley
and ssd

2020-10-02T18:26:00 bentley -> azot
Yes it will really speed things up.

2020-10-02T18:26:15 bentley -> azot
I also bought myself a new computer and it has already paid for itself many times over

2020-10-02T18:26:22 bentley -> azot
Ka started working

2020-10-02T18:26:43 bentley -> azot
At minimum cost, start with a csd

2020-10-02T18:26:54 bentley -> azot
CPU if possible and memory

2020-10-02T18:27:03 bentley -> azot
A csd will speed up everything by half

2020-10-02T18:29:46 azot -> bentley
are you using another machine for testing ?

2020-10-02T18:29:51 azot -> bentley
or personal

2020-10-02T18:30:02 bentley -> azot
personal

2020-10-02T18:32:17 azot -> bentley
I'll make it up tomorrow

2020-10-02T18:32:20 azot -> bentley
with a car

2020-10-02T18:32:27 azot -> bentley
so

2020-10-02T18:32:29 azot -> bentley
How does the name change ?

2020-10-02T18:32:36 azot -> bentley
not a user but a com

2020-10-02T18:32:51 bentley -> azot
what kind of os?

2020-10-02T18:33:00 azot -> bentley
7ka

2020-10-02T18:33:14 azot -> bentley
You should already memorize commands so you don't have to dig around

2020-10-02T18:33:40 bentley -> azot
I'll run it now

2020-10-02T18:33:43 azot -> bentley
now I understand why admins use command line and not gui

2020-10-02T18:33:49 azot -> bentley
Yes, I'll find it.

2020-10-02T18:33:56 bentley -> azot
Well hell is quicker and easier

2020-10-02T18:34:21 bentley -> azot
and you can also do everything with batch files ))

2020-10-02T18:34:30 azot -> bentley
hmm

2020-10-02T18:34:34 azot -> bentley
What's that like?

2020-10-02T18:34:52 bentley -> azot
well.

2020-10-02T18:34:58 bentley -> azot
some other time))

2020-10-02T18:35:20 azot -> bentley
found how

2020-10-02T18:35:28 bentley -> azot
ok

2020-10-02T18:35:38 azot -> bentley
Damn, after renaming, you have to restart.

2020-10-02T18:35:42 azot -> bentley
Oh, that wind.

2020-10-02T18:36:06 azot -> bentley
I'll make a note to myself: ask Ben about packages )

2020-10-02T18:36:21 bentley -> azot

2020-10-02T18:38:35 azot -> bentley
went looking for

2020-10-02T18:39:51 azot -> bentley

2020-10-02T18:40:02 bentley -> azot
Look in the bots.

2020-10-02T18:40:12 bentley -> azot

2020-10-02T18:40:39 azot -> bentley
can't see

2020-10-02T18:40:49 bentley -> azot
waiting

2020-10-02T18:41:42 azot -> bentley
I will transfer the virtual machine to my computer tomorrow and it will be better

2020-10-02T18:41:52 azot -> bentley
I once thought it was better not to cross

2020-10-02T18:41:56 bentley -> azot
Yep

2020-10-02T18:42:02 bentley -> azot
better at your place

2020-10-02T18:42:31 azot -> bentley
I mean a second clean computer, not a personal one

2020-10-02T18:42:55 bentley -> azot
Well, if you're more comfortable that way, then yes

2020-10-02T18:43:00 azot -> bentley
I'm a terribly paranoid person.

2020-10-02T18:43:07 bentley -> azot
I am more comfortable working on 1 + virtual machines and wps

2020-10-02T18:43:21 bentley -> azot
it's easier to wpc + wpn before it

2020-10-02T18:43:48 azot -> bentley
wpc ?

2020-10-02T18:43:53 azot -> bentley
what it is

2020-10-02T18:44:15 bentley -> azot
virtual prfyvat server. Dedicated server in the inter

2020-10-02T18:44:30 bentley -> azot
you buy and work by rdp if vinda

2020-10-02T18:44:52 azot -> bentley
I'll learn the tricks from you

You have to wait, it may not appear right away.

the description says 5 minutes, ok, I'll wait a little longer

2020-10-05T14:50:10 azot -> bentley
By a full test do you mean the whole cycle according to the manual Testing of the BC ?

2020-10-05T14:50:30 bentley -> azot

2020-10-05T17:17:14 bentley -> azot
yeah ok

2020-10-05T17:17:19 bentley -> azot
The main thing is that we figured it out.

2020-10-05T17:17:28 bentley -> azot
There must be something wrong with the passwords.

2020-10-05T17:17:37 bentley -> azot
Winrar works out fine

2020-10-05T17:18:11 azot -> bentley

2020-10-05T17:58:32 azot -> bentley
13 minutes of silence in the backdoor is normal for a bot ?

2020-10-05T17:58:51 bentley -> azot
It hit me right away.

2020-10-05T18:00:38 azot -> bentley

2020-10-06T11:51:47 azot -> bentley
What is the load check ?

2020-10-06T11:54:33 bentley -> azot
load is what launches the lowder or a program of some kind

2020-10-06T12:14:25 azot -> bentley
more questions than answers Ben, read the manual and there is a hole of understanding in your head

2020-10-06T12:14:41 bentley -> azot
read it again

2020-10-06T12:14:51 bentley -> azot
google unfamiliar words and read it again )

2020-10-06T12:14:54 bentley -> azot
then do

2020-10-06T12:15:23 azot -> bentley
lero is what ? googled, I try to google everything to minimize questions

2020-10-06T12:15:39 bentley -> azot
And in context?

2020-10-06T12:15:49 azot -> bentley
put a new task with incode 0 in lero

2020-10-06T12:15:55 azot -> bentley
I nicht understand

2020-10-06T12:16:02 bentley -> azot
Ask him.

2020-10-06T12:16:11 bentley -> azot
Say you're new and ask for help figuring it out

2020-10-06T12:16:21 azot -> bentley
You mean Bill ?

2020-10-06T12:16:26 bentley -> azot
yes

2020-10-06T12:16:35 azot -> bentley
looking dumb is okay ?

2020-10-06T12:16:47 bentley -> azot
Of course you're in the new thread.

2020-10-06T12:23:34 azot -> bentley
Ben, it takes me so long to understand and the process itself is tolerable ?

2020-10-06T12:40:17 bentley -> azot
I was like that in the beginning too ok

2020-10-06T12:40:42 azot -> bentley
Well, there must have been a knowledge and skill base

2020-10-06T12:43:39 bentley -> azot
I also learned everything from scratch, except for administering PCs and running dlls)

2020-10-06T12:46:37 azot -> bentley
there you go, I have administration in a very elementary position as you understood

2020-10-06T12:46:47 azot -> bentley
for dll is still a very difficult question

2020-10-06T12:46:51 bentley -> azot
ok that's enough )

2020-10-06T12:46:53 azot -> bentley
well the library

2020-10-06T12:47:06 bentley -> azot
For starters. Basic in the process )

2020-10-06T12:53:39 azot -> bentley
I mean, I believe you and I will try to understand everything, because I liked it here and I don't plan to stop or give up

2020-10-06T13:06:55 bentley -> azot
That's good )

2020-10-06T13:19:48 azot -> bentley
Ben, if you can decipher the words - first run asjaster and make a working dll

2020-10-06T13:19:58 azot -> bentley
I read the manuals but still.....

2020-10-06T13:20:59 bentley -> azot
here ) I don't know what )

2020-10-06T13:21:07 bentley -> azot
Ask him sequentially what and how

2020-10-06T13:21:11 bentley -> azot
by jackhammer

2020-10-06T13:36:33 azot -> bentley
I'm going to wait for him now, and I'm going to torture him with questions. For me 90% of what's going on right now is magic, especially working with dlls and Pauwersheld. I hope he can chew on it.

2020-10-06T13:39:22 bentley -> azot
yes he can

2020-10-06T13:39:29 bentley -> azot
For now, then, study with him today.

2020-10-06T13:39:49 bentley -> azot
Look on the web to see how it works: work with the vershel

2020-10-06T13:40:11 azot -> bentley
already reading

2020-10-06T13:40:28 azot -> bentley
Okay, I'll torture him with questions.

2020-10-06T17:06:37 azot -> bentley
we found common ground with ben

2020-10-06T17:06:42 azot -> bentley
oy Bill )

2020-10-06T17:06:57 bentley -> azot
Very good )

2020-10-06T17:06:59 azot -> bentley
And it's slowly starting to make sense to me.

2020-10-06T17:07:19 azot -> bentley
The main thing here is to chew it right, and to teach it is an art without three minutes

2020-10-06T17:08:01 azot -> bentley
and I'll say it again, I wouldn't want to get lost, how to minimize that risk

2020-10-06T17:08:08 azot -> bentley
little do

2020-10-06T17:08:35 bentley -> azot
Now

2020-10-06T17:08:36 azot -> bentley
I had a hardd die once, and everything was lost irretrievably

2020-10-06T17:08:57 bentley -> azot
make an archive with all accesses with password.

2020-10-06T17:09:05 bentley -> azot
Upload it to the cloud somewhere

2020-10-06T17:09:05 azot -> bentley
and tell me how to properly store the information or where

2020-10-06T17:09:10 bentley -> azot
pfshd e.g.

2020-10-06T17:09:14 bentley -> azot
gmail

2020-10-06T17:09:26 bentley -> azot
the main thing is the big password, but that you have to remember it

2020-10-06T17:09:29 bentley -> azot
phrase

2020-10-06T17:10:08 azot -> bentley
will do

2020-10-06T18:02:23 bentley -> azot
Make yourself a public account, too.

2020-10-06T18:23:20 azot -> bentley
How do you understand public ?

2020-10-06T18:23:28 azot -> bentley
in this case

2020-10-06T18:23:37 bentley -> azot
any way

2020-10-06T18:23:48 bentley -> azot
exploit.im for example

2020-10-06T18:23:59 azot -> bentley
I like it when, for example

2020-10-06T18:24:02 azot -> bentley
will do

2020-10-06T18:24:03 bentley -> azot
just give a new account in the jabber and select sign in

2020-10-06T18:24:19 bentley -> azot
Only the name is different and then I have to put it here

2020-10-06T18:24:26 azot -> bentley
got it

2020-10-06T18:24:45 azot -> bentley
I'll make an extra personality, after your advice

2020-10-06T18:25:11 bentley -> azot
)

2020-10-06T20:33:08 azot -> bentley
awake ?

2020-10-06T20:37:50 bentley -> azot
I'm on my way out.

2020-10-06T20:37:52 bentley -> azot
Tomorrow )

2020-10-06T20:38:00 azot -> bentley
got it

2020-10-06T20:38:09 azot -> bentley
See you tomorrow Ben

2020-10-06T20:38:10 bentley -> azot
See you tomorrow )))

2020-10-06T20:38:20 azot -> bentley
I'm like a pioneer always ready)

2020-10-06T20:38:30 bentley -> azot
))

2020-10-06T20:40:11 azot -> bentley
hopefully soon I can log on to exploit.im with this and go to sleep

2020-10-06T20:43:35 bentley -> azot
hopefully soon I can log on to exploit.im with this and go to sleep

2020-10-07T10:46:14 azot -> bentley
hi

2020-10-07T10:46:42 azot -> bentley
I register a public toad and understand that there is a bag and a wagon of knowledge gaps

2020-10-07T10:51:58 bentley -> azot
I can help in an hour if you don't

2020-10-07T10:52:41 azot -> bentley
I'm always happy to get any help, but you have to do it yourself first

2020-10-07T10:52:46 azot -> bentley
me today with Bill ?

2020-10-07T10:53:05 bentley -> azot
did you make him?

2020-10-07T10:53:33 azot -> bentley
we didn't get to the end, he'll come and we'll finish it

2020-10-07T10:53:45 azot -> bentley
While I was messing around with the load myself

2020-10-07T10:55:10 azot -> bentley
introduced me to the library and reminded me to execute commands from the line

2020-10-07T11:01:30 bentley -> azot
do well.

2020-10-07T12:39:26 azot -> bentley
Ben i nid help

2020-10-07T12:39:49 bentley -> azot
say

2020-10-07T12:40:03 azot -> bentley
Bill gave Defender's contact

2020-10-07T12:40:06 azot -> bentley
for the test

2020-10-07T12:40:11 azot -> bentley
I can't get through to him.

2020-10-07T12:40:22 bentley -> azot
He takes a long time to answer.

2020-10-07T12:40:32 bentley -> azot
busy

2020-10-07T12:40:44 azot -> bentley
hmm

2020-10-07T12:47:57 azot -> bentley
so, you said to ask, and I will ask what passes me by

2020-10-07T12:49:03 azot -> bentley
Bill said to test one part of the program, he said to ask Def if there is a knockout, but how to do this if he does not get in touch?

2020-10-07T12:49:09 azot -> bentley
Or am I missing the trivia again

2020-10-07T12:49:27 bentley -> azot
all the way

2020-10-07T12:49:36 bentley -> azot
write to def and wait for a reply

2020-10-07T13:38:14 azot -> bentley
I'm getting something Ben ) I'm happy

2020-10-07T13:38:27 bentley -> azot
Wonderful!

2020-10-07T14:09:40 azot -> bentley
I wanted to ask the professor about the admin, but it says not to disturb until 22

2020-10-07T14:09:50 azot -> bentley
can i write or not ?

2020-10-07T14:18:16 bentley -> azot
Write to him closer to 22

2020-10-07T14:18:26 azot -> bentley
ok

2020-10-07T14:18:58 azot -> bentley
Ben don't take this the wrong way, but I was wondering if you were aware of

2020-10-07T14:19:08 azot -> bentley
For the test, let's say we were given the domains

2020-10-07T14:19:27 azot -> bentley
But I don't understand what they are for exactly

2020-10-07T14:19:42 azot -> bentley
Especially when you see a named domain and not a no-name one

2020-10-07T14:19:51 bentley -> azot
Don't believe me, I've never tested it ))

2020-10-07T14:20:01 bentley -> azot
Ask everything from Beale and the manuals

2020-10-07T14:20:09 azot -> bentley
got it

2020-10-07T14:25:03 azot -> bentley
Because you know, you see the domain of a well-known company and then the thoughts start to go in your head

2020-10-08T07:16:44 azot -> bentley
Hi Ben

2020-10-08T07:16:46 azot -> bentley
I'm in position

2020-10-08T07:16:55 bentley -> azot
+

2020-10-09T19:42:33 azot -> bentley
good evening ben

2020-10-09T19:42:41 azot -> bentley
Listen, I wanted to ask you if you know

2020-10-09T19:42:45 bentley -> azot
Prviet

2020-10-09T19:42:51 azot -> bentley
do you know how many kinds of testing there are ?

2020-10-09T19:42:55 azot -> bentley
you have

2020-10-09T19:43:00 bentley -> azot
2

2020-10-09T19:43:08 bentley -> azot
manual and automatic

2020-10-09T19:43:12 bentley -> azot
in short

2020-10-09T19:43:27 bentley -> azot
or do you mean the other thing? the test objects?

2020-10-09T19:43:48 azot -> bentley
Yeah, about objects.

2020-10-09T19:43:58 azot -> bentley
Here we were, we tried, we tried, we tried with Bill.

2020-10-09T19:44:07 bentley -> azot
A shitload of a few dozen in all

2020-10-09T19:44:18 azot -> bentley
Holy shit

2020-10-09T19:44:26 bentley -> azot
all sorts of vpn browser modules bots...

2020-10-09T19:44:36 azot -> bentley
cool

2020-10-09T19:46:46 azot -> bentley
So it is possible that I will try different tests ?

2020-10-09T19:47:02 bentley -> azot
Yes, if it's interesting ))

2020-10-09T19:48:08 azot -> bentley
Well, I think that for sure it will not be boring at first I am sure

2020-10-09T19:48:16 azot -> bentley
which means it's interesting

2020-10-09T19:48:42 bentley -> azot
Yep )

2020-10-09T19:48:43 azot -> bentley
And you want to justify yourself, too.

2020-10-09T19:49:39 azot -> bentley
and also, after Bill I'll come back to you ? sounds good ))

2020-10-09T19:50:37 bentley -> azot
))

2020-10-09T19:50:44 bentley -> azot
And you didn't leave so

2020-10-09T19:51:06 azot -> bentley
well ok, an old friend is better than two new ones ))

2020-10-09T19:52:02 bentley -> azot
Yep )

2020-10-09T20:14:03 azot -> bentley
Ben, can you tell me about the trade later, if it's not difficult

2020-10-09T20:14:07 azot -> bentley
what and how

2020-10-09T20:14:10 azot -> bentley
traded a long time ago

2020-10-09T20:14:27 azot -> bentley
you have to think about retirement )

2020-10-09T20:14:44 azot -> bentley
I mean stocks

2020-10-09T20:17:08 azot -> bentley
I remember you trade scalping, but I mean through who is better now and in what market

2020-10-09T20:20:23 bentley -> azot
Yeah, we'll talk during the week.)

2020-10-09T20:21:45 azot -> bentley
 great

2020-10-09T20:22:07 azot -> bentley
I'm just asking small questions, no lecture on how to make dough)

2020-10-12T08:29:59 azot -> bentley
Hi Ben

2020-10-12T08:30:24 azot -> bentley
<bill@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> all commands are in base64, I don't know how to do it, ask defender or bentley

2020-10-12T08:30:59 bentley -> azot
Hi.

2020-10-12T08:31:03 bentley -> azot
Defender has this one.

2020-10-12T08:31:59 azot -> bentley
got it

2020-10-12T20:36:55 azot -> bentley
awake ?

2020-10-12T20:38:10 azot -> bentley
Was supposed to do a test, but it didn't work out.

2020-10-12T20:38:39 azot -> bentley
I hope Def will be more cooperative tomorrow

2020-10-12T20:38:42 azot -> bentley
sorry

2020-10-13T11:57:16 bentley -> azot
Prviet

2020-10-13T12:54:37 bentley -> azot
Are you there? Message me back.

2020-10-13T12:54:47 azot -> bentley
hi

2020-10-13T12:55:07 bentley -> azot
What's on your tags?

2020-10-13T12:55:15 azot -> bentley
practicing incodes

2020-10-13T12:55:43 bentley -> azot
In the process of short, right?

2020-10-13T12:55:49 azot -> bentley
yes

2020-10-13T12:55:52 bentley -> azot
Do you have any idea how much more time you need?

2020-10-13T12:55:55 azot -> bentley
I do the same thing with Def

2020-10-13T12:56:01 bentley -> azot
There's just a customer rushing to get it right

2020-10-13T12:58:13 azot -> bentley
Huh, an hour or two.

2020-10-13T13:19:05 azot -> bentley
Ben, I can't right now.

2020-10-13T13:19:06 azot -> bentley
sorry

2020-10-13T13:19:08 azot -> bentley
no way

2020-10-13T13:19:10 azot -> bentley

2020-10-13T13:19:24 bentley -> azot
What is it?

2020-10-13T13:21:14 azot -> bentley
test

2020-10-13T13:21:21 bentley -> azot
Why?

2020-10-13T13:24:47 azot -> bentley
have to go away

2020-10-13T13:25:24 bentley -> azot
When will you?

2020-10-13T13:25:34 azot -> bentley
In about two hours or three

2020-10-13T13:25:46 bentley -> azot
The main thing is to finish the tests today.

2020-10-13T15:21:00 azot -> bentley
I'm still on the road

2020-10-13T15:21:08 azot -> bentley
put it on my smartphone

2020-10-13T15:21:11 azot -> bentley
Ben

2020-10-13T15:21:29 bentley -> azot
Ok

2020-10-13T15:21:34 bentley -> azot
Get there, report back.

2020-10-13T15:21:43 azot -> bentley
Ben, I have a couple of questions

2020-10-13T15:21:50 bentley -> azot
Go to

2020-10-13T15:21:51 azot -> bentley
to which I would like to know the answer

2020-10-13T15:23:03 bentley -> azot
Ask

2020-10-13T15:23:44 azot -> bentley
in fact, this test can already be called an infiltration

2020-10-13T15:24:04 azot -> bentley
I've already seen bots working in the admin area on corporate computers

2020-10-13T15:24:19 azot -> bentley
that's essentially hacking, isn't it ?!

2020-10-13T15:24:47 bentley -> azot
Yes

2020-10-13T15:25:17 azot -> bentley
Why do you need people like me? If I didn't have kids, one conversation, and I have kids

2020-10-13T15:25:19 bentley -> azot
It's not even the hack itself anymore, but the attempt to consolidate

2020-10-13T15:25:39 bentley -> azot
I have three kids. The coders here are all men.

2020-10-13T15:25:55 azot -> bentley
I first thought you were K-Division, I know how they bait

2020-10-13T15:26:00 bentley -> azot
No

2020-10-13T15:26:28 bentley -> azot
Our organization works purely on US and Tdhjgt

2020-10-13T15:26:31 bentley -> azot
Europe

2020-10-13T15:26:33 bentley -> azot
not RU

2020-10-13T15:26:36 bentley -> azot
and not CIS

2020-10-14T08:29:40 azot -> bentley
Hi, this is where I do

2020-10-14T08:31:02 bentley -> azot
Hi

2020-10-14T09:10:54 bentley -> azot
Great. The men are already waiting. any idea of the time?

2020-10-14T09:11:33 azot -> bentley
Trying, Ben, to stay close to the computer

2020-10-14T09:11:43 azot -> bentley
understandings xx

2020-10-14T09:11:50 bentley -> azot
Okay, do it.

2020-10-14T09:11:50 azot -> bentley
Well, before noon in Moscow

2020-10-14T12:08:58 bentley -> azot
Tell me, how can I help you with admin?

2020-10-14T12:09:07 bentley -> azot
Beale says there's some kind of problem?

2020-10-14T12:09:20 azot -> bentley
don't know how to make commands

2020-10-14T12:09:28 azot -> bentley
incodes 3 and 4

2020-10-14T12:10:02 bentley -> azot
What's the admin?

2020-10-15T18:58:56 azot -> bentley
Ben, there were some problems there.

2020-10-15T18:58:59 azot -> bentley
Hi

Hi

2020-10-27T09:08:53 bentley -> azot
 <bentley> Tried crypt yesterday - didn't knock. Started to make it with syshop - admin area is glitchy
[16:06:20] <buza> hmm
[16:06:21] <bentley> Nitrogen will report the situation
[16:06:44] <bentley> today we will try to sedal already crypt and test and give out
[16:06:51] <buza> what kind of glitches were there?
[16:06:58] <bentley> bot ids changed
[16:07:09] <bentley> the system wasn't detected correctly
[16:07:13] <buza> let me guess, you used the same file from different machines
[16:07:20] <buza> without firmware id
[16:07:35] <bentley> id firmware was done
[16:07:37] <bentley> aaaah
[16:07:45] <bentley> got it
[16:07:59] <buza> yeah, I got it too, last night
[16:08:19] <bentley> Thu also one id one file

2020-10-27T09:10:41 bentley -> azot
