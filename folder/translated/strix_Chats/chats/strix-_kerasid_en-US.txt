Hi

2020-08-17T13:29:42 strix -> kerasid
Looks like Carter didn't pay

2020-08-17T13:29:50 strix -> kerasid
He needs to be reminded.

2020-08-17T13:29:52 kerasid -> strix
bureaucrats

2020-08-17T13:30:02 kerasid -> strix
there are already three in the chain))

2020-08-17T13:30:20 kerasid -> strix
Remind me again?

2020-08-17T13:30:44 strix -> kerasid
I told him to pay on the 12th. Looks like he's out of money again and can't catch Stern.

2020-08-17T13:30:55 kerasid -> strix
stern was tight yesterday today

2020-08-17T13:30:57 kerasid -> strix
and at night was

2020-08-17T13:31:01 strix -> kerasid
whom do I remind

2020-08-17T13:31:11 kerasid -> strix
Well, I meant pay for it.

2020-08-17T13:31:35 strix -> kerasid
Well, a lot of people pass out on the weekend.

2020-08-17T13:31:49 strix -> kerasid
You can't usually catch a carter on the weekend either

2020-08-17T13:32:03 strix -> kerasid
So he must have missed that Stern was

2020-08-17T13:32:21 kerasid -> strix
It's okay, if you know what to do, then the rest is a matter of technique.

2020-08-17T13:32:35 kerasid -> strix
I forgot it was Monday, maybe I was the one who saw Stern on Friday...

2020-08-17T13:32:38 strix -> kerasid
you have to kick the carter - I'll do it myself
