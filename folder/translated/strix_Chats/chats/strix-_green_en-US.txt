torify ssh vbox@173.232.146.236 -p 2022

here is the check-rout.sh script: https://privnote.com/BPv8Irld#YGPiqvS4Q

2020-10-21T15:58:04 strix -> green
run it like this:
./check-rout.sh servers.txt [redirs.txt [port]

2020-10-21T15:58:50 strix -> green
servers.txt -- router file format:
IP user password port

redirs.txt -- file with lines like:
46.28.69.153:443
31.14.40.68:443

default port 449

If you want to change it to 443, for example, you can specify it in the comstring
