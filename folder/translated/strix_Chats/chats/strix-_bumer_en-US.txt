Hey bro, I'm from the same guy)

2020-07-06T21:18:35 strix -> bumer
Well, he gave me access, I'll put it in.

2020-07-06T21:18:58 strix -> bumer
do you have a cobalt distro?

2020-07-06T21:19:00 bumer -> strix
Did they give you a server where to put it?

2020-07-06T21:19:11 strix -> bumer
Uh-huh

2020-07-06T21:20:47 strix -> bumer
Poll said that everything is already installed on that server

2020-07-06T21:20:58 strix -> bumer
But we need a second server to spare

2020-07-06T21:21:27 bumer -> strix
So there's going to be a server on the server?)

2020-07-06T21:21:37 bumer -> strix
like under 2 cobalt?

2020-07-06T21:21:54 bumer -> strix
Or they are two completely different servers

2020-07-06T21:22:18 strix -> bumer
two pieces of the second one as a spare

2020-07-06T21:23:07 bumer -> strix
So, what do you need to discount?

2020-07-06T21:23:11 bumer -> strix
walker?

2020-07-06T21:34:33 strix -> bumer
Well yes, if you can. Or at least where to get it and what version

2020-07-06T21:34:45 bumer -> strix
I'll throw it right now.
