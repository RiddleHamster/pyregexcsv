hi

2020-06-26T20:39:33 strix -> carter
are you still here? Here this server is down 46.249.32.111, admin gives "Error: Vm not found.

2020-06-26T20:39:52 strix -> carter
It has to be paid by July 1, but I think there should still be time

2020-06-26T20:40:16 strix -> carter
can you see if it really needs to be paid urgently?

2020-06-26T20:40:49 strix -> carter
I've been asked there to set something up -- thought I'd do it this weekend and today, and here's the bummer.

2020-06-26T20:43:33 carter -> strix
Hi, I'll open a ticket, the gang recently had the same thing on this host, in the end it turned out to be a failure on their side and all data went down the drain

2020-06-26T20:44:27 strix -> carter
Yeah, well, open it then.

2020-06-26T20:44:48 strix -> carter
By the way, you can put money into the account right away.

2020-06-26T20:44:59 strix -> carter
There's a deadline of July 1

2020-06-26T20:47:27 carter -> strix
not yet, if history repeats, it would be better to change the host to another one

2020-06-26T20:47:58 strix -> carter
If the data is lost?

2020-06-26T20:48:35 strix -> carter
I don't know, maybe so

I saw it, thank you. I can't pay yet.

2020-07-05T19:38:09 strix -> carter
Listen, how do you pay for those servers, which through peipal? through a bitcoin exchanger to peipal?

2020-07-05T19:40:20 strix -> carter
I looked at bestchanger, there are only about a dozen exchangers working with paypal, and the minimum is 0.005 BTC or more

2020-07-05T19:40:57 strix -> carter
Which is about 40 bucks, and that's a lot of money

2020-07-05T19:42:50 strix -> carter
because I need 7 euros a month for my own server - such a small amount

2020-07-05T19:43:45 carter -> strix
localbitcoins.com via bitcoin-to-card exchange, which are tied to the account of the pn

2020-07-05T19:44:23 strix -> carter
on yours?

2020-07-05T19:45:23 strix -> carter
Is there any output to paypal from localbitcoins?

2020-07-05T19:49:32 carter -> strix
No, the card is phantom. withdrawal is, sellers put limits on the amount themselves, and probably from $0

2020-07-05T19:54:54 strix -> carter
Is it an unverified paypal? As far as I remember, until I verified my paypal account I couldn't pay or withdraw anything from my account. I could deposit money into it, but I couldn't withdraw it.

2020-07-05T19:55:18 strix -> carter
Can I transfer from a linked card to an unverified paypal?

2020-07-05T19:56:19 strix -> carter
The card is phantom - i.e., is it registered to a fake person? Do they sell those?

2020-07-05T20:24:57 carter -> strix
account is verified, I do not use a paypal account, so I can't say for sure about the transfer, cards are probably sold somewhere, I did not have to buy

2020-07-06T05:32:56 strix -> carter
I see that 185.25.51.139 is already up, duh

2020-07-06T05:32:59 strix -> carter

2020-07-06T15:38:32 strix -> carter
I will have to order a new VPS instead of 209.239.116.15 :(

2020-07-06T15:40:00 strix -> carter
And will you also order another vpc to store backups?

2020-07-06T15:40:40 strix -> carter
You can have both with a 50 gig drive. 200 gigs is even a bit much.

2020-07-06T16:20:35 strix -> carter

There are constant glitches with it - all of a sudden the connection to it disappears, and the ssh-key fingerprint changes. Then after some time everything goes back to the way it was. It seems to be a result of IP conflicts -- two servers with the same IP address are fighting each other.

2020-07-20T17:25:46 strix -> carter

2020-07-22T19:11:23 strix -> carter

Can you replace 66.42.113.88 with another one, preferably on a different hosting?

2020-07-23T14:51:04 carter -> strix
okay

2020-07-23T14:52:20 strix -> carter
And the data is lost, for some unknown reason. VPS knocked out yesterday although the deadline, in theory, today. e would like to lose the data again. Plus, the lack of reboot button is somehow not komilfo.

2020-07-23T14:52:41 strix -> carter
Have you paid it off yet?

2020-07-23T14:54:33 carter -> strix
paid yesterday, maybe the support has a backup or have you communicated with them yet?

2020-07-23T14:55:43 strix -> carter
I asked them what happened -- no answer yet.

2020-07-23T14:56:12 strix -> carter
You can ask about a backup, but I don't think there is one.

2020-07-23T14:58:25 strix -> carter
You can, of course, wait to see what the answer is first.

I was also surprised that they don't even have a reboot button in the panel

2020-07-23T16:45:56 strix -> carter
I.e., to contact the support for every sneeze

2020-07-23T16:46:32 strix -> carter

2020-07-23T17:11:48 strix -> carter
That's it, it's better to fuck off with this hosting and register somewhere else.

2020-09-11T19:10:34 carter -> strix
Hi, yes, thanks for sending, I'll pay

2020-09-11T19:12:24 strix -> carter
Please pay those three as soon as possible. The rest are already from Tuesday - enough time. I'm sorry I didn't put this list up sooner :(

2020-09-11T19:21:32 carter -> strix
ok, i'll pay them first. i'm not asking you for this list, why and what's the apology about?

2020-09-11T19:21:41 strix -> carter
192.210.152.100 instead of 198.46.198.129 (the VPN was reinstalled, IP changed)

2020-09-11T19:23:46 strix -> carter
I just should have given you the list earlier, not at the end of the day before the weekend. I thought I'd give it to you Monday or Tuesday, but I forgot the 13th is Sunday.

2020-09-15T14:48:37 strix -> carter
Hi. Don't forget to pay these 173.232.146.29 today 173.232.146.93 194.36.191.164 -- three of 8 left -- paid the rest.

2020-09-17T15:12:41 strix -> carter
Hi

2020-09-17T15:14:22 strix -> carter

2020-09-17T15:19:06 strix -> carter
And can you also order a vpc or dedic for bitcoin node? I need 16gb of RAM and 2 ter drives (preferably).

2020-09-17T15:20:35 strix -> carter

Oh man, it won't copy, and restarting the psi doesn't help
