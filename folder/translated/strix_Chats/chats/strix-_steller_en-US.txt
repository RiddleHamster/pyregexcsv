Hi. Do you have a working openvpn config for windows?

2020-08-03T15:03:36 strix -> steller
hi

2020-08-03T15:03:53 strix -> steller
What kind of VPN do you need?

2020-08-03T15:04:01 strix -> steller
mars?

2020-08-03T15:08:20 steller -> strix
Yes, you can mars. Just doesn't work.

2020-08-03T15:11:22 strix -> steller
Why didn't you ask before? I probably changed the config more than a month ago. I'll give you an updated one.

2020-08-03T15:13:58 steller -> strix
Yes, the configurations did not work all the time.

Parl to the "eat_my_shorts" archive

*password

2020-08-03T15:21:24 steller -> strix
By the way, https://qaz.im/ doesn't steam captchas, so it's better to use it

2020-08-03T15:30:02 steller -> strix
It worked.

2020-08-03T15:38:36 strix -> steller
Yeah, we should try it.

2020-08-03T15:38:42 strix -> steller
it's good

2020-08-03T15:38:59 steller -> strix
Do you know why some virtual machines don't connect? Messages are popping up:

u/d=down -- it looks like,,,, this tun interface didn't go up for some reason. Why, it is not clear from these messages. We need to look at it in more detail.

Hi.
Green said that you can set up a connection to the AD server on a virtual machine. I need to test something on it.
Is this possible?
I already have an AD server on the virtual machine.

2020-09-30T10:24:58 strix -> steller
hi

2020-09-30T10:25:06 strix -> steller
I'm still busy with the previous request of greene

2020-09-30T10:25:25 strix -> steller
I can't help you yet. I'll get to it when I'm done.

2020-09-30T10:35:05 steller -> strix
I see.
Then I won't configure it locally yet.

2020-09-30T10:36:51 strix -> steller
I'll try to be quicker, of course.

2020-10-05T12:26:21 steller -> strix
Hi.

2020-10-05T12:29:58 strix -> steller
Hi

2020-10-05T12:30:24 steller -> strix
Have you watched AD yet?

2020-10-05T12:31:04 strix -> steller
Nah, there was a problem with the vpn's here -- I had 4 more set up.

2020-10-05T12:31:27 strix -> steller
What is it again?

2020-10-05T12:32:24 steller -> strix
There is a server on the virtuals. Need to connect clients or find connected clients

2020-10-05T12:33:28 strix -> steller
On the 2nd virtualbox server? Which group of virtualboxes?

2020-10-05T12:33:59 steller -> strix
173.232.146.199:32005 - here is the server

2020-10-05T12:34:27 strix -> steller
That's it and connect it to the domain?

2020-10-05T12:35:24 steller -> strix
It represents the domain itself. You also need to connect the workstations to it

2020-10-05T12:39:10 strix -> steller
What's the name of the vituulka? And which ones do you need to connect?

2020-10-05T12:40:14 steller -> strix
Virtualbox virtualbox.
Yes, any free ones.

2020-10-05T12:41:32 strix -> steller
Yep, Server1016 KING

2020-10-05T12:42:31 strix -> steller
Well I don't really know what their free ones are. That's probably something you should ask the testers.

2020-10-05T12:43:12 steller -> strix
I'm about to find out.

2020-10-05T12:50:22 strix -> steller
What's the question?

2020-10-05T12:50:50 steller -> strix
JohnJackson1111

2020-10-05T12:51:08 strix -> steller
thank you

2020-10-05T12:56:00 strix -> steller
Why can't I get to the start menu?

2020-10-05T12:56:19 strix -> steller
are the tamaddishenzes even standing up?

2020-10-05T12:56:53 strix -> steller
The Windows screen doesn't fit in mine and the start menu is hard to reach

2020-10-05T12:58:16 strix -> steller
Holy shit 1920x950

2020-10-05T12:58:35 strix -> steller
Who put that much and what for?

2020-10-05T12:58:58 strix -> steller
My laptop is only 1366x768 and can't work

2020-10-05T13:00:09 strix -> steller
Are you coming soon? Maybe I can make it to the store in time?

2020-10-05T13:14:51 strix -> steller
okay, kingston suggested two virtuals:

2020-10-05T13:14:53 strix -> steller
173.232.146.199:32019 - 8.1
173.232.146.199:32018 - 7Ñ…64

2020-10-05T13:15:04 strix -> steller
Okay, I'm going to go to the store for now.

2020-10-05T13:21:50 steller -> strix
I don't know who put it in. I just have the stretching turned on.

2020-10-05T13:55:17 strix -> steller
/me came home

2020-10-05T13:55:35 strix -> steller
I'll put a smaller one then.

2020-10-05T13:56:24 steller -> strix
Yes, put it however you like.

2020-10-05T14:00:59 strix -> steller
it's strange, all virtuals change the resolution to what I set in the rdp-client, but in this one for some reason not

2020-10-05T14:03:30 steller -> strix
I never install from linux at all

2020-10-05T14:03:59 strix -> steller
The two are standing, too.

2020-10-06T12:21:43 steller -> strix
Hi. How's it going there with AD?

2020-10-06T12:24:34 strix -> steller
hi

2020-10-06T12:25:34 strix -> steller
Server and one client machine made, but when I got to the second machine, it turned out that there is a non-standard password. Couldn't figure it out.

2020-10-06T12:25:59 steller -> strix
Maybe get another car?

2020-10-06T12:26:20 strix -> steller
I understand you have to ask kingston. Yesterday the question came up at the most inopportune moment, and there was no one to ask.

2020-10-06T12:26:44 steller -> strix
I think Kingston has the normal one.

2020-10-06T12:27:30 steller -> strix
Is it already possible to enter the client machine for tests?

2020-10-06T12:28:19 strix -> steller
In theory, you can do it 32018 which is

2020-10-06T12:28:27 strix -> steller
I'll ask Kingston.

2020-10-06T13:22:40 strix -> steller

Checked in. Thanks.

2020-10-06T13:26:23 strix -> steller

Yep, already both

2020-10-06T13:27:30 steller -> strix
Oh, that's great. Thanks
