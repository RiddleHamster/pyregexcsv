Hi

2020-07-13T14:44:45 skywalker -> strix
I was sent to you by defender

2020-07-13T14:45:00 skywalker -> strix
With a question about IIS

2020-07-13T14:45:40 skywalker -> strix
On deploying the site on iis

2020-07-13T14:46:32 strix -> skywalker
On IIS? What's the question? I've never used IIS, to be honest.

2020-07-13T14:47:00 skywalker -> strix
:)

2020-07-13T14:47:42 strix -> skywalker
Why IIS? What's wrong with apache or Nginx?

2020-07-13T14:51:01 skywalker -> strix
Yes I have a project I need to put a hook on a function that sits in the httpapi library on the windows server and handles requests. Actually need to intercept these requests. One of the requirements to work with iis. I am relatively new to windows. Chel simulate a server with the site and on it to practice interception, well, and actually debug the solution.

2020-07-13T14:51:21 skywalker -> strix
I got the site discounted by Bill.

2020-07-13T14:52:17 skywalker -> strix
I thought maybe we have someone who has dealt with this. Wrote defender he redirects to you)

2020-07-13T14:52:33 skywalker -> strix
I guess I'll have to count the rake)

2020-07-13T14:56:35 strix -> skywalker
And what is unclear about the deployment of the site? What is the site even written in? Any ASPs?

2020-07-13T14:58:12 skywalker -> strix
aspx js

2020-07-13T14:59:01 strix -> skywalker
And what is the question?

2020-07-13T14:59:36 skywalker -> strix
 In general terms it's clear that it has to be some kind of a muscle database plus something else... some kind of js engine... How to do all this on a Windows server

2020-07-13T15:00:32 skywalker -> strix
No need for details, a general outline will suffice

2020-07-13T15:02:00 strix -> skywalker
No idea yet. I'll have to Google it.

2020-07-13T15:03:19 skywalker -> strix
Ok. I'll be googling)

2020-07-13T15:03:43 strix -> skywalker
Well, it's easy enough to put musculus on the windup. But about JS you need to see what kind of framework it is. How about NodeJS?

2020-07-13T15:04:00 skywalker -> strix
Yes most likely.

2020-07-13T15:04:54 skywalker -> strix
I'll look into it then, I wanted to get through this a little quicker. Apparently not)

2020-07-13T15:05:17 skywalker -> strix
Okay. Thanks for your time.

2020-07-13T15:05:41 strix -> skywalker
Here's something I googled https://dev.to/petereysermans/hosting-a-node-js-application-on-windows-with-iis-as-reverse-proxy-397b -- you can try it

2020-07-13T15:07:22 strix -> skywalker
As I understand it, NodeJS has its own webserver. You'll have to configure IIS as a reverse proxy. I can try to help with that.

2020-07-13T15:08:09 skywalker -> strix
Ok. I'll ask you when I duck into this, then.

2020-07-13T15:08:23 strix -> skywalker
ok

2020-07-13T15:10:04 strix -> skywalker
So, what's ASP there for? Is NodeJS there as a backend or frontend?

2020-07-14T21:30:53 skywalker -> strix
You have to look it up. I don't know. Most likely the front.

2020-07-14T21:31:15 skywalker -> strix
* Didn't see a message from you

Been digging around all day yesterday. Still do not understand how to expand. Root directory looks like this (took a picture of the screen) :

I don't know, the file names don't tell me anything

2020-07-15T11:45:21 skywalker -> strix
Yeah, I'm the same thing hassled. Put the muscle separately on the server, downloaded jumla and put it with demo content.

2020-07-15T11:46:20 strix -> skywalker
maybe def knows?

2020-07-15T11:48:00 skywalker -> strix
But the address of the site turns out to be /IP/SiteIIS/joomla. Maybe). I should probably be fine for debugging purposes for now. The goal was to run the server and deploy the debugging software site on it.
