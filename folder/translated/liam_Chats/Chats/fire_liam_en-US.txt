[06.07.21 18:09:25] liam: Ok, is there zuminfo?
[06.07.21 18:12:51] fire: no zuminfo yet(
it will be here soon, but you have to tweak your workcomputer/browser to fit it
there's cookies, 2fa, soxes, etc.
it's always a problem with root accounts

signalhair is not a bad analogue, but there are only 100 requests per month
the request token is only spent when the system finds emails and / or phones
it's a bought account, so it's better to use american sox
[06.07.21 18:20:42] liam: Mhm
[06.07.21 18:20:45] liam: Huh okay
[06.07.21 18:24:44] fire: gut)

[07.07.21 09:18:41] fire: I tried it too, it's just not the same
[07.07.21 09:20:17] liam: It's okay
[07.07.21 09:20:26] fire: gut)
[07.07.21 12:14:06] liam: angloamerica has a plain uk domain, but it's generic, you should probably use it
[07.07.21 12:14:29] fire: sec
[07.07.21 12:17:32] fire: look, yes, it turns out their main site is without a subdomain
but all these subdomains and third party sites are subsidiaries and affiliates

[07.07.21 12:17:49] liam: great)

NETWORK DATA
====================================================================

This section contains data that we get from the analysis of Internet domains and IP spaces belonging to the company. This can include:

1. the Internet domain as such
2. domain information - meaning WHOIS data such as IP notation, domain registrar, age, domain acquirer, and so on.
3. Subdomains, preferably with IP addresses. For example, if we have a domain microsoft.com, then the subdomains will look like accounts.microsoft.com, login.microsoft.com...
4. Other information: here we should write additional data on the domain - raw-format ssl-certificates, any analytical output of tools, vulnerabilities detected by osint-instruments, additional data, open TCP-ports of domains, and so on. Remember - any information about the company may be useful for its competitor, i.e. our client, so do not disregard even the seemingly insignificant moments. We need EVERYTHING!

Preferably women, they are easier to work with

the employee should have phone numbers, mail and social networking numbers, other information - if possible

[25.08.21 14:30:38] fire: torus has many less functions
[25.08.21 14:30:48] fire: for security purposes
[25.08.21 14:31:05] fire: signalhair can simply authorize via it
[25.08.21 15:11:51] liam: it just opened in another browser
[25.08.21 15:11:59] liam: you should try to open it in torus
[25.08.21 15:12:35] fire: here, I said - brave and torus tab
[25.08.21 15:12:51] fire: you can use Firefox, but you'll have to install addons there
[25.08.21 15:13:06] liam: and says there are five tokens
[25.08.21 15:14:10] fire: yeah, not paid yet
[25.08.21 15:14:19] fire: I texted the franc, it was just checking if everything was okay
[25.08.21 15:15:31] liam: ok
[25.08.21 16:31:57] liam: can you make a tor tab in chrome or something?
[25.08.21 16:34:55] fire: maybe if you add an addon
[25.08.21 16:35:10] fire: but I don't use them, it's too much trouble
[25.08.21 16:35:15] liam: mmm
