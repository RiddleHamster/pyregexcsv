[01.07.21 16:25:05] liam: How do you do it?
[01.07.21 16:25:17] frances: get an electrum wallet
[01.07.21 16:25:28] frances: And withdraw it via exchanger or changelist
[01.07.21 16:25:35] liam: I already had a transfer once, transfer it to your account and then to me
[01.07.21 16:28:00] liam: And by the next time, I may work out a purse, we just agreed that not through bitcoins, and on the account will pay
[01.07.21 16:28:32] frances: so we don't pay
[01.07.21 16:28:37] frances: who did you negotiate this with?
[01.07.21 16:28:49] frances: make a withdrawal through some kind of exchange to the card
[01.07.21 16:28:56] frances: Create a payment there and send me the amount and wallet number
[01.07.21 16:30:37] liam: Why?
[01.07.21 16:30:48] liam: Is there a problem?
[01.07.21 16:30:54] liam: I got paid this way before
[01.07.21 16:31:09] frances: yes, I only pay btz bro
[01.07.21 16:31:21] frances: I don't know who sent it to the card
[01.07.21 16:31:29] frances: only if you change it through exchangers
[01.07.21 16:31:33] liam: I did not handle it at all and do not understand how to make conclusions, how to create a payment
[01.07.21 16:31:40] frances: I need a separate wallet
[01.07.21 16:31:54] frances: https://electrum.org/#download
[01.07.21 16:32:09] frances: everything there is elementary
[01.07.21 16:32:26] liam: And you can withdraw money to your account from it?
[01.07.21 16:32:54] liam: I will do it, but why can't you just transfer it?
[01.07.21 16:32:56] frances: Yes,
[01.07.21 16:33:01] frances: try binance exchange
[01.07.21 16:33:07] frances: there's withdrawal to the card
[01.07.21 16:33:12] frances: you can make a wallet there too
[01.07.21 16:33:18] frances: you also have an app for your phone
[01.07.21 16:34:52] liam: As far as I understand, bitcoins can not be transferred they can only be sold and what to do if I can not sell them
[01.07.21 16:35:53] frances: buddy
[01.07.21 16:35:59] frances: study this in detail
[01.07.21 16:36:02] frances: everything is done there
[01.07.21 16:36:15] frances: you need to know it, you will need it in your work and in life in general)
[01.07.21 16:36:22] frances: so be sure to learn about bitcoin
[01.07.21 16:36:28] frances: everything there is translated and sold without any problems
[01.07.21 16:36:53] frances: there are exchangers, you can create an application for payment - send them bitcoins - they send you back fiat money
[01.07.21 16:37:08] frances: if you need it, you can sell on the exchange at the rate you like, but it's not certain that you will sell
[01.07.21 16:37:24] liam: yes, I understand, but why can't you withdraw and transfer to the account?
[01.07.21 16:37:30] frances: if you just trade - you send them a wallet btz, they send you a fiat card - your interest for the exchange
[01.07.21 16:37:38] frances: cause I don't do that buddy
[01.07.21 16:37:44] frances: I pay everybody in bitcoins
[01.07.21 16:38:04] frances: we have so many of you, if I were to change everyone else, you'd wait a long time for your salary)
[01.07.21 16:38:20] frances: we pay in btz - the rest is your trouble
[01.07.21 16:39:39] liam: this is bullshit
[01.07.21 16:39:49] liam: what are you doing?
[01.07.21 16:40:11] liam: you want to pay in bitcoins, create wallets for employees and give instructions
[01.07.21 16:40:25] liam: you make me do random things now
[01.07.21 16:40:32] liam: this is just nonsense
[01.07.21 16:40:36] frances: don't you have hands to google and read how to make an electrum wallet?
[01.07.21 16:40:50] frances: buddy, you're more of a talker.
[01.07.21 16:40:56] frances: There's only two buttons to press
[01.07.21 16:41:32] liam: okay, you have bitcoins, but not everyone needs bitcoins, if it's so easy, translate them or let the manager translate into regular currency and translate
[01.07.21 16:41:44] liam: okay, let's see
[01.07.21 16:42:17] frances: man. we got 200 people here and more.
[01.07.21 16:42:22] frances: all get paid in btu
[01.07.21 16:42:28] frances: I won't make exceptions for one person
[01.07.21 16:42:38] frances: I have a boss' order to pay in bitcoins
[01.07.21 16:42:48] frances: I'm powerless here
[01.07.21 16:42:54] liam: interesting
[01.07.21 16:43:05] frances: I won't create payments for you
[01.07.21 16:49:54] liam: help me figure it out, I'll work it out with mayor later
[01.07.21 16:50:32] liam: If it's your job, if someone prohibited it to you, tell me, I will talk to them
[01.07.21 16:50:41] liam: You deduce for yourself somehow
[01.07.21 16:50:54] liam: But for me it's almost dark
[01.07.21 16:50:56] liam: ahah
[01.07.21 16:52:26] liam: Okay, now I've installed and started the wallet, what next?
[01.07.21 16:52:55] frances: 10 min
[01.07.21 16:53:32] liam: Ok)
[01.07.21 16:55:43] frances: you have to click on get tab
[01.07.21 16:56:08] frances: there you just hit expires:week
[01.07.21 16:56:20] frances: this wallet number will be valid for a week
[01.07.21 16:56:31] frances: or until I send money there
[01.07.21 16:57:48] liam: Something's wrong with the chat room
[01.07.21 16:57:50] liam: Now
[01.07.21 16:58:28] liam: That's it, I'm here
[01.07.21 16:58:36] liam: I did that, then
[01.07.21 16:58:49] frances: Wallet number will appear there
[01.07.21 16:58:53] frances: set of numbers and letters
[01.07.21 16:58:57] frances: I need it sent
[01.07.21 16:58:58] liam: press new address, right?
[01.07.21 16:59:01] frances: yes
[01.07.21 16:59:15] liam: bc1qqzpl0d4ergjg6rf3l7zzas345v9j7cvr58wtd
[01.07.21 16:59:19] frances: yeah
[01.07.21 16:59:43] liam: ))
[01.07.21 17:00:02] frances: sent all the bits
[01.07.21 17:00:05] frances: they won't fall right away
[01.07.21 17:00:14] frances: it will take some time until the blocks are sent down the chain
[01.07.21 17:00:26] frances: the higher miner commission you set - the faster they are transferred
[01.07.21 17:00:40] frances: further down to the left you have a balance - they will hang there
[01.07.21 17:00:43] frances: to send to someone else
[01.07.21 17:00:57] frances: send - insert purse number of recipient - and specify amount
[01.07.21 17:01:02] frances: in btz or fiat
[01.07.21 17:01:15] frances: Go to settings - there are exchange rates
[01.07.21 17:01:37] frances: Choose whatever you like and the wallet will show the equivalent in fiat currency at the rate of this exchange
[01.07.21 17:02:56] liam: unconfirmed +37 something there
[01.07.21 17:03:36] frances: yes it shows a transaction in your favor
[01.07.21 17:03:46] frances: and as soon as all blocks are decrypted it will be on your account
[01.07.21 17:03:57] frances: bro youtube has tons of videos on crypto and how to work with it
[01.07.21 17:04:02] frances: make sure you learn it
[01.07.21 17:04:12] frances: you'll need it next
[01.07.21 17:04:15] frances: necessary
[01.07.21 17:04:20] liam: I researched it, but haven't worked with it yet
[01.07.21 17:05:45] liam: and i really hoped i wouldn't need it, once i was already paid for part of my work and asked in bitcoins or to card and i said let's go to card, it's good to get familiar with this system, but i don't need it, maybe you want to avoid transfer records for employees, but that's too much
[01.07.21 17:06:15] liam: I hope that I will quickly transfer everything and finally calm down)
[01.07.21 17:06:57] liam: Maybe they already came?
[01.07.21 17:07:08] liam: I set up Binance
[01.07.21 17:07:51] frances: you already have the bits
[01.07.21 17:08:02] frances: if you need to withdraw it urgently - withdraw it via network changelists
[01.07.21 17:08:13] liam: thanks for helping me understand, I'll take it quickly
[01.07.21 17:08:24] liam: yes, there was a note in the description
[01.07.21 17:08:29] liam: that's why I asked
[01.07.21 17:08:53] frances: https://www.bestchange.ru
[01.07.21 17:08:54] liam: of course I have to withdraw now
[01.07.21 17:08:59] frances: That's where it's supposed to be easy
[01.07.21 17:09:09] frances: you should choose a trusted broker and they will tell you how and what to withdraw
[01.07.21 17:09:12] liam: do you use it?
[01.07.21 17:09:15] frances: they will take a small withdrawal fee
[01.07.21 17:09:26] frances: I use another one, but this one is ok too
[01.07.21 17:09:42] liam: binance was not necessary to download, yes)

[01.07.21 17:12:22] frances: here's the changer's contact
[01.07.21 17:12:32] frances: There are a lot of guys like him at bestenge
[01.07.21 17:14:17] liam: I clicked on some mine in the list, got to some site
[01.07.21 17:14:49] liam: https://mine.exchange/?rid=17
[01.07.21 17:17:56] liam: and binance what I downloaded, can I delete it? or is it possible to exchange there?
[01.07.21 17:20:23] frances: you can also exchange
[01.07.21 17:20:27] frances: but you have to learn it bro
[01.07.21 17:20:39] frances: use Maine Exchange to create payment
[01.07.21 17:21:40] liam: I was advised this
[01.07.21 17:21:41] liam: https://p2p.binance.com/ru
[01.07.21 17:23:24] frances: well
[01.07.21 17:23:29] frances: that's binance
[01.07.21 17:23:35] frances: same
[01.07.21 17:23:45] frances: just a direct exchange between the participants
[01.07.21 17:23:53] frances: but there is also a variant of exchange with the exchange
[01.07.21 17:24:00] frances: the difference in the exchange rate
[01.07.21 17:24:05] frances: but I did not withdraw it myself
[01.07.21 17:25:26] liam: is it worse?
[01.07.21 17:26:32] frances: I didn't try that
[01.07.21 17:26:42] frances: I tell you I cash out right away, but I withdraw large amounts
[01.07.21 17:26:50] liam: i wish i could do that huh
[01.07.21 17:26:51] frances: For small amounts they charge exorbitant commissions
[01.07.21 17:26:58] liam: Oh, I gotta make some money now
[01.07.21 17:27:11] liam: I'll take my advice and try something
[01.07.21 17:29:29] frances: O.K., write me if anything
[01.07.21 17:29:35] liam: Okay)
[01.07.21 18:02:00] liam: maybe I should advise somebody else you transferred to
[01.07.21 18:08:19] frances: for what purpose?
[01.07.21 18:10:19] liam: you have to wait for verification
[01.07.21 18:10:27] liam: it will be there for another week or two
[01.07.21 18:10:50] liam: I'll try this method you told me about, mine exchange
[01.07.21 18:11:10] liam: and wanted to ask how other colleagues withdrew
[01.07.21 18:17:54] frances: it will be there for another week or two - a couple of hours it goes there
[01.07.21 18:18:19] frances: about the other bros, I won't say, it's closer to anyone, and I'm not interested usually
[01.07.21 18:20:43] liam: you transferred me microbitcoin, this is a different currency, right?
[01.07.21 18:22:47] liam: and or it's MBTC, it seems to be not the same as mBTC
[01.07.21 18:23:24] frances: no i transferred exactly bitcoin
[01.07.21 18:23:28] frances: BTC
[01.07.21 18:23:30] liam: ok
[01.07.21 18:24:21] liam: now I'll pick up another output while binance is verified
[01.07.21 18:24:45] liam: oh
[01.07.21 18:25:05] liam: it looks like he verified, but he wrote that he would be verified for two weeks
[01.07.21 18:25:31] frances: it's fast there now
[01.07.21 18:26:17] liam: it says 0.03757867 - 88693.62
[01.07.21 18:28:34] liam: he wrote 90900 somewhere else
[01.07.21 18:51:10] liam: it turns out I leave in the purse some more
[01.07.21 19:12:04] liam: they say there is a wallet "bitcoin wallet" and it is safer
[01.07.21 19:15:20] frances: it turns out I will leave some money in my wallet when transferring - just kopecks
[01.07.21 19:15:39] frances: in general, leave some of it in your wallet, try different currencies)
[01.07.21 19:15:48] frances: you can make good money on exchange rates
[01.07.21 19:18:49] liam: huh
[01.07.21 19:18:51] liam: yes
[01.07.21 19:18:59] liam: but I'll leave it later
[01.07.21 19:19:21] liam: now it's time to upgrade computer and something urgent for work and life
[01.07.21 19:19:39] liam: I need to earn more money
[01.07.21 19:26:33] liam: I wonder if you can immediately transfer money to your Binans purse if I use it?
[01.07.21 19:34:08] frances: yes you can
[01.07.21 19:34:14] frances: it's essentially the same purse
[01.07.21 19:34:28] liam: okay, I'll figure out how to withdraw from it
[01.07.21 19:34:54] liam: God willing, I'll thank you for the paycheck, you thank me for the job ahah
[01.07.21 19:35:07] liam: and it will be possible to transfer to a purse in Binance already
[01.07.21 19:35:11] frances: waiting for results
[01.07.21 19:35:13] liam: now
[01.07.21 19:58:13] liam: Thank God
