[11.11.21 15:14:52] gnome: hi.
[11.11.21 15:15:06] gnome: ready for an interview, here in chat format ?
[11.11.21 15:15:40] Liam: hi, yeah, probably
[11.11.21 15:15:53] gnome: Great.
[11.11.21 15:16:10] gnome: tell me briefly about yourself, what you know, what skills, what experience ?
[11.11.21 15:17:52] Liam: never dealt with your tasks, worked in a carj most of the time, decided to maybe discover something new for myself, ready and willing to learn, never been a system administrator and so on
[11.11.21 15:18:15] gnome: where did you work?
[11.11.21 15:18:39] Liam: in team, by myself, different times, leaked everything about $
[11.11.21 15:18:58] gnome: got it,
[11.11.21 15:19:05] gnome: you must know
[11.11.21 15:19:21] gnome: how are you with computers?
[11.11.21 15:19:33] gnome: You didn't study chemistry
[11.11.21 15:19:36] Liam: Yeah, I'm a little friendly
[11.11.21 15:19:39] Liam: No.
[11.11.21 15:20:08] gnome: okay, there's a pentest.
[11.11.21 15:20:10] gnome: heard what it is?
[11.11.21 15:20:28] Liam: yeah, testing networks for vulnerabilities
[11.11.21 15:20:32] gnome: yeah.
[11.11.21 15:20:37] Liam: I see what you're doing.
[11.11.21 15:20:47] gnome: and specifically here it would be like this:
infiltration - info upload - system lock
[11.11.21 15:20:57] gnome: bonuses are tasty
[11.11.21 15:21:03] Liam: I know.
[11.11.21 15:21:05] gnome: because of the specifics of the job
[11.11.21 15:21:15] Liam: They say it's equal to terrorism
[11.11.21 15:21:24] gnome: dunno.
[11.11.21 15:21:51] Liam: well, the pindos are going wild with it
[11.11.21 15:22:11] gnome: okay, let's do this, i'll ask for you access to live chat, and then i'll send it to you, within a day
[11.11.21 15:22:24] gnome: work as a rule from 15 to 1 am, but sometimes it varies
[11.11.21 15:22:27] gnome: can't fuck it up
[11.11.21 15:22:36] gnome: there are down times
[11.11.21 15:23:03] gnome: while you fix your security, organize your workplace
[11.11.21 15:23:09] gnome: how long will it take you?
[11.11.21 15:23:09] Liam: no problem, I need a vector, maybe more tutorials to get me more into it, because I'm repeating, I've never done it before.
[11.11.21 15:23:20] gnome: everything will be gradual
[11.11.21 15:23:22] gnome: take your time
[11.11.21 15:23:24] Liam: Okay.
[11.11.21 15:23:34] Liam: everything works for me
[11.11.21 15:23:36] gnome: fix security and tell me how much time you need ?
[11.11.21 15:23:39] gnome: ready for you ?
[11.11.21 15:24:02] Liam: But I have a hospital next week, one day later I can
[11.11.21 15:24:25] Liam: what about security ?
[11.11.21 15:24:35] gnome: to be able to work
[11.11.21 15:24:47] gnome: you won't be using your home computer with your home internet
[11.11.21 15:24:57] gnome: open without socks, vpn, tor and so on
[11.11.21 15:25:15] Liam: I have a VPN, I need a Kilswich with torrent traffic
[11.11.21 15:25:19] Liam: I'm not home
[11.11.21 15:25:22] gnome: just do it.
[11.11.21 15:25:22] Liam: Lefty internet
[11.11.21 15:25:26] gnome: how much time ?
[11.11.21 15:25:45] Liam: I think today or tomorrow
[11.11.21 15:25:49] gnome: okay.
[11.11.21 15:26:16] gnome: when you're done, let me know.
[11.11.21 15:26:17] Liam: I have to pay for ipn yet, I think it expired the other day, I'll look into it and see
[11.11.21 15:26:23] Liam: Shall I give you a ring?
[11.11.21 15:26:26] gnome: yeah.
[11.11.21 15:26:36] gnome: and while I'm asleep, I need to step away.
[11.11.21 15:26:40] Liam: Okay.
[12.11.21 15:36:53] Liam: hi, here?
[12.11.21 16:00:41] gnome: privet
[12.11.21 16:00:42] gnome: yes
[12.11.21 16:01:27] Liam: I did, but I'm afraid I don't have enough resources for everything.
[12.11.21 16:01:35] Liam: what if I need to go somewhere?
[12.11.21 16:02:24] Liam: Go away, plus I'd like to go to the hospital for a while
[12.11.21 16:05:12] gnome: when are you going to the hospital and for how long ?
[12.11.21 16:05:50] Liam: I can't say for sure yet, I have to pass examinations and take tests
[12.11.21 16:06:14] Liam: Later it will be clear on the basis of this, but then there are queues
[12.11.21 16:06:20] Liam: I think in December
[12.11.21 16:06:39] gnome: for how long ?
[12.11.21 16:07:17] Liam: No, I think in 3-4 days I will be on my feet, I do not know
[12.11.21 16:07:44] gnome: what about going somewhere?
[12.11.21 16:07:50] gnome: go away often ?
[12.11.21 16:08:13] Liam: No, I mean leaving home for the city
[12.11.21 16:08:37] Liam: that's time too, you can lose a whole day with those trips
[12.11.21 16:08:58] Liam: but usually I'm always at the computer in the evening
[12.11.21 16:09:07] gnome: and how often do you have to leave like that?
[12.11.21 16:09:14] gnome: just get it right, you will be trained
[12.11.21 16:09:28] gnome: after you will be given a job to do and it must be done and not travel to do other things
[12.11.21 16:09:40] Liam: not often, there's a period coming up that needs an operation, I'm getting ready
[12.11.21 16:09:49] gnome: Anything happens, sometimes you need it, but if you have it on a regular basis, then you can't do it...
[12.11.21 16:09:50] Liam: I understand
[12.11.21 16:10:04] Liam: No, not all the time.
[12.11.21 16:10:16] gnome: before the operation, that's the topic and all ?
[12.11.21 16:10:28] Liam: maybe I should do the surgery first and then start
[12.11.21 16:10:34] Liam: Yeah.
[12.11.21 16:10:46] Liam: I'm usually in touch.
[12.11.21 16:10:52] Liam: It's not like I work somewhere.
[12.11.21 16:13:14] gnome: let's say you'll get your salary after the operation, when your movements will be episodic, not systematic
[12.11.21 16:13:28] gnome: in the meantime, you can slowly get involved, read, watch
[12.11.21 16:13:54] gnome: that's so you don't waste time, but if you want you can after the operation
[12.11.21 16:26:09] Liam: yes, you can do it that way, but how much is the salary?
[12.11.21 16:26:44] Liam: I'd like to get in and read anyway, it's better than to wait
[12.11.21 16:28:00] Liam: nobody knows when exactly the operation will take place, there are a lot of appointments and queues, epidemiological situation may change, they say next year at all
[12.11.21 16:30:31] gnome: $1.5k
[12.11.21 16:30:55] gnome: If you happen to be there, you'll get your salary
[12.11.21 16:31:16] Liam: Okay, deal.
[12.11.21 16:31:27] gnome: great
[12.11.21 16:31:33] gnome: I'll throw you access later.
[12.11.21 16:31:41] Liam: ok
[12.11.21 17:53:35] gnome: https://privnote.com/TS1dV6tK#OnCnDBZrN
[12.11.21 20:48:32] gnome: here ?
[12.11.21 21 21:17:28] Liam: da
[12.11.21 21:18:05] Liam: I'm in, I'm reading
[12.11.21 21:18:37] Liam: by the way, can you give me the ipn config?
