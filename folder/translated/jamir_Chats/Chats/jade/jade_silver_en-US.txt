[19.07.21 14:42:15] jade: hi! Yes, already told stout `about his unique approach, he checked it). before encryption has not yet reached, the questions through it, I mostly try to solve, so as not to bother you

[20.07.21 11:29:39] jade: Hi, if I have an initiative to make the CIS check better and of higher quality, can I do it or is it unnecessary and should I move on to other stages sooner?
[20.07.21 11:30:07] jade: i was confused by the layout check only
[20.07.21 11:30:25] silver: hi.
[20.07.21 11:30:31] silver: It's up to you.
[20.07.21 11:30:46] silver: tz is more of a pushy recommendation
[20.07.21 11:30:58] silver: if you know exactly how to do it, of course do it
[21.07.21 10:15:29] jade: some companies specially put the Russian keyboard, so the rule - have a Russian keyboard - go out wrong. I'll do as in the job, add more checks, but I want you to take this into account when drawing up TOR
[21.07.21 10:16:17] silver: Okay.
[21.07.21 10:16:45] silver: Some companies specially put the Russian keyboard,

[21.07.21 10:18:26] silver: maybe check your locale?
[21.07.21 10:19:15] jade: for example, I'll check the language of the system. They obviously will not allow their employees to use the system with these settings, because it will bring a lot of inconvenience and, consequently, losses.)
[21.07.21 10:20:15] silver: check currency and penny divider
[21.07.21 10:20:19] jade: No, they don't write articles on this subject.
[21.07.21 10:20:24] silver: got it
