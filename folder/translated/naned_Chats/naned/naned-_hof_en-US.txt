hi

2020-07-30T14:00:17 naned -> hof
Hi, Buza wrote to me that you have a template of module dll, api which is described in module_HOWTO, can you please send me

2020-07-30T14:00:36 hof -> naned
hi

2020-07-30T14:00:50 hof -> naned
In about 15-20 minutes I'll send you

2020-07-30T14:01:09 naned -> hof
ok, ok

2020-08-12T10:45:25 naned -> hof
Hi, listen, there's a little problem with the module

2020-08-12T10:47:07 naned -> hof
Bottom line: I load it with LoadLibrary, x86 is fine, then I go to the 64-bit version and get an Error code - 126 (The module could not be found)

2020-08-12T10:47:23 hof -> naned
Hi

2020-08-12T10:47:41 naned -> hof
have you encountered these problems? I've just never compiled libs

2020-08-12T10:47:48 hof -> naned
64 version from a 32 bit program?

2020-08-12T10:47:53 naned -> hof
no

2020-08-12T10:47:58 naned -> hof
64 of 64

2020-08-12T10:48:40 hof -> naned
strange of course, I think there is a small bug somewhere

2020-08-12T10:48:51 hof -> naned
Maybe the name of the dll is wrong?

2020-08-12T10:49:22 naned -> hof
well I just change the platform of the builder and the lib itself

2020-08-12T10:49:39 naned -> hof
compile and replace the lib

2020-08-12T10:49:54 naned -> hof
the names are the same in the 32nd as in the 64th bit version

2020-08-12T10:50:40 hof -> naned
make sure the dll is in the same folder, and that the bits are the same

2020-08-12T10:50:51 hof -> naned
should work

2020-08-12T10:51:04 naned -> hof
ah lol

2020-08-12T10:51:27 naned -> hof
everything yes, I dumbly stuck it in the 32-bit version and ran it through the 64 debugger

2020-08-12T10:51:47 naned -> hof
it's epic, sorry for the distraction.

2020-08-12T10:51:56 hof -> naned
happens )

2020-08-19T07:23:03 naned -> hof
Hi, I was wondering when buza will be back?

2020-08-19T07:42:30 hof -> naned
hi

2020-08-19T07:42:39 hof -> naned
The booze will be at the end of the month.

2020-08-19T07:43:08 hof -> naned
how are you doing with the module?

2020-08-19T07:48:11 naned -> hof
Seems ok, I have long time ago, but I have questions about the functionality

2020-08-19T07:48:40 hof -> naned
was there a tz?

2020-08-19T07:48:54 naned -> hof
well in fact there is no specific one

2020-08-19T07:49:41 hof -> naned
ask, maybe I'll give you a hint.

2020-08-19T07:50:10 naned -> hof
before he left I was given the task to make a light version of the tool that I wrote, I made it quickly enough, then integrated it into a dll, but now the question is about the full version

2020-08-19T07:50:50 naned -> hof
The question is whether to make a separate dll version of the module or to shove everything into 1

2020-08-19T07:51:18 naned -> hof
what was the problem in the beginning in two words

2020-08-19T07:51:52 hof -> naned
I think you should make a separate one.

2020-08-19T07:52:42 naned -> hof
I wrote a tool which reads chipset VID DID through IO and then works depending on the generation, buta asked to write platform checker without driver

2020-08-19T07:53:36 hof -> naned
and send the information to the server?

2020-08-19T07:55:06 naned -> hof
Well, yes, it makes sense that there is a separate one, I just wanted to clarify

2020-08-19T07:55:19 naned -> hof
I don't know what to do with the info next

2020-08-19T07:56:06 naned -> hof
this booza didn't tell me, I just send it as messages via lpEventCallback for now

2020-08-19T07:56:18 hof -> naned
That's good enough for now

2020-08-19T07:56:29 hof -> naned
The messages will reach the command server

2020-08-19T07:57:20 hof -> naned
so feel free to do the full version of the module

2020-08-19T07:58:28 naned -> hof
But also, you can't obfuscate andrivet strings when calling lpEventCallback, do they need to be obfuscated with something?

2020-08-19T07:59:56 hof -> naned
we obfuscate strings so that it is not so easy for antiviruses to set detections

2020-08-19T08:00:19 hof -> naned
i.e. as little statics as possible in the body of dll or exe

2020-08-19T08:00:57 hof -> naned
the meaning so that the string is decrypted (or generated) just before use

2020-08-19T08:01:14 naned -> hof
yes I understand that

2020-08-19T08:01:22 hof -> naned
then immediately nulled

2020-08-19T08:01:54 hof -> naned
and why andrivet when calling lpEventCallback won't work?

2020-08-19T08:04:49 naned -> hof
I don't remember anymore, I'll look it up and report back then.

2020-08-19T08:05:14 hof -> naned
ok

2020-08-19T08:05:24 naned -> hof
 I think they only obfuscate strings on the stack

2020-08-19T08:05:32 naned -> hof
but it's not exact

2020-08-19T08:05:48 hof -> naned
so got the string on the stack, copied it anywhere

2020-08-19T08:06:09 hof -> naned
sent, nulled, released memory

2020-08-19T08:07:31 naned -> hof
I'll try it now, I remember I had some problems with it, maybe I made some light error again.

2020-08-19T08:30:55 naned -> hof
hmm, everything works without any tambourine at all

2020-08-19T08:31:18 hof -> naned
great

2020-08-19T08:31:41 naned -> hof
strange, it looks like I messed up somewhere again then(

2020-08-19T08:32:05 hof -> naned
A lot depends on compiler optimization

2020-08-19T08:32:17 hof -> naned
should always be checked after changing settings

2020-08-19T08:32:18 naned -> hof
Ð°

2020-08-19T08:32:35 naned -> hof
maybe yes, I configured the options after that

2020-08-19T08:33:04 naned -> hof
Got it, thanks for the info!

2020-08-19T08:33:14 hof -> naned
you're welcome

2020-09-16T08:34:03 naned -> hof

2020-09-16T09:26:48 hof -> naned
in the resources of the driver?

2020-09-16T09:26:56 naned -> hof
yes

2020-09-16T09:27:21 hof -> naned
encryption would be desirable.

2020-09-16T09:27:24 hof -> naned
d:\src\rw\rwxe3\rw\driver\objfre_win7_x86\i386\RwDrv.pdb

2020-09-16T09:27:30 naned -> hof
ok

2020-09-16T09:27:44 hof -> naned
remove debug info from the driver

2020-09-16T09:27:48 naned -> hof
Yes, I was thinking about that, I forgot to ask the booz

2020-09-16T09:27:54 naned -> hof
it is signed

2020-09-16T09:28:04 naned -> hof
it's easier to encrypt

2020-09-16T09:28:59 hof -> naned
and maybe not in the resources, but in the code or data section to hide it

2020-09-16T09:29:01 naned -> hof
The driver is not mine, it is the driver of a tool to work with all sorts of registers, memory ports, etc.

2020-09-16T09:29:08 hof -> naned
I understand

2020-09-16T09:29:21 hof -> naned
\rwdrv.sys - encrypt into .rdata

2020-09-16T09:29:27 hof -> naned
line

2020-09-16T09:30:46 naned -> hof
Yes, I missed something.

2020-09-16T09:31:07 hof -> naned
check it, look through the binary in a hex editor

2020-09-16T09:31:54 naned -> hof
i think i checked it, maybe i put the wrong IDA in the release, i'll fix it
so what about the driver, where to shove it and how?

2020-09-16T09:32:16 naned -> hof
is there any means of automating this kind of thing?

2020-09-16T09:32:50 naned -> hof
Or just put it in with your own hands?

2020-09-16T09:32:57 hof -> naned
You have to make a utility program yourself.

2020-09-16T09:33:15 naned -> hof
well and better encrypted?

2020-09-16T09:33:34 hof -> naned
Yes, encrypt it.

2020-09-16T09:34:10 hof -> naned
if in the data section, then maybe some simple xor encryption, and then let's say convert to base64

2020-09-16T09:34:36 hof -> naned
if in a code section, I think xor will be enough

2020-09-16T09:35:00 naned -> hof
Well critically with the data section

2020-09-16T09:35:05 hof -> naned
You can also use resources, but I think that's more likely to scorch avs

2020-09-16T09:35:33 hof -> naned
Make it as easy as you want it to be.

2020-09-16T09:35:44 hof -> naned
If they start to fire, you'll redo it.

2020-09-16T09:35:50 naned -> hof
ok

2020-09-16T09:37:52 hof -> naned
I think that's how it used to work before, I haven't checked with the new version vs

2020-09-16T09:37:54 hof -> naned

#pragma code_seg(push, ".text")
char const __declspec(allocate(".text")) _read64ptr[] = {
    0x48, 0x8b, 0x44, 0x24, 0x08, /* mov rax, [rsp + 8] */
    0x8b, 0x00, /* mov eax. [rax] */
    0x8b, 0x50, 0x04, /* mov edx, [rax + 4] */
    0xcb /* retf */
};
#pragma code_seg(pop)

2020-09-16T09:39:25 naned -> hof
I'm going to try it now.

2020-09-16T09:59:18 naned -> hof
Yes works like this:
#pragma code_seg(push, ".text")
__declspec(allocate(".text"))
const char _read64ptr[] =
{
	0x48, 0x8b, 0x44, 0x24, 0x08, /* mov rax, [rsp + 8] */
	0x8b, 0x00, /* mov eax. [rax] */
	0x8b, 0x50, 0x04, /* mov edx, [rax + 4] */
	0xcb /* retf */
};
#pragma code_seg(pop)

2020-09-16T09:59:51 hof -> naned
great

2020-09-16T10:00:55 naned -> hof
I'll redo it now.

2020-09-16T10:01:11 hof -> naned
ok

2020-09-16T10:49:31 naned -> hof
it worked, it's ok, I'll check it now, prepare versions and send it to you

2020-09-16T10:49:51 naned -> hof
did the usual xor but in the code

2020-09-16T10:50:30 hof -> naned
ok

2020-09-16T10:54:30 naned -> hof
is it okay if the linker puts this code at the very beginning of the segment?

2020-09-16T10:58:12 hof -> naned
I think it's OK for now, although you can add 500 bytes of garbage

hi, ok

2020-09-17T08:11:21 hof -> naned
Does the module send information via events?

2020-09-17T08:11:35 naned -> hof
yes

2020-09-17T08:11:40 hof -> naned
ok

2020-09-17T08:11:42 naned -> hof
bouza said to leave it that way for now

2020-09-17T08:11:49 hof -> naned
yeah, ok

2020-09-17T14:49:26 hof -> naned
how do you send the message? please send the code in the place where you send ErrorInitPlatform

2020-09-17T15:33:23 naned -> hof
	//If the platform is not intel, then exit
	if (InitPlatform() != SUCCESS)
	{

		lpEventCallback(hModuleHandle, OBFUSCATED("ErrorInitPlatform"), OBFUSCATED("NoIntelPlatform"), NULL, 0, OBFUSCATED("Tag"), lpEventContext);
		goto Finish;
	}

2020-09-17T15:34:20 hof -> naned
How do you check the platform?

2020-09-17T15:34:34 naned -> hof
and InitPlatform returns non-SUCCESS only if
	if (PlatformInfo.PCHPlatformInfo.vid != 0x8086)
		return ERROR_VID;

2020-09-17T15:34:53 hof -> naned
So it doesn't work on x64?

2020-09-17T15:35:02 naned -> hof
no it does not work on amd

2020-09-17T15:35:42 hof -> naned
then the 64 bit module is useless?

2020-09-17T15:35:47 naned -> hof
they somehow didn't want to make their specs available to the public

2020-09-17T15:36:08 naned -> hof
no works only on Intell chipsets

2020-09-17T15:36:16 hof -> naned
trouble

2020-09-17T15:36:38 naned -> hof
What chipset do you have, maybe I can find one specifically for it

2020-09-17T15:37:31 hof -> naned
It is just that there are very few x86 machines, most of them are amd64.

2020-09-17T15:39:39 naned -> hof
stop

2020-09-17T15:39:54 naned -> hof
amd64 is a bit rate, a set of instructions

2020-09-17T15:40:55 naned -> hof
it's just called amd, I don't know if it's because it might have appeared on amd printers first

2020-09-17T15:43:32 hof -> naned
So, what do you mean by platform then?

2020-09-17T15:43:34 naned -> hof
a chipset is a set of controllers in the motherboard, just Intell have specs on them, and I quickly figured out what and where to write, with amd process did not go so easily and I told Boose that so far it is only Intell chipsets, he said okay, need to generally understand if it will work and on how many machines

2020-09-17T15:43:53 naned -> hof
Well I have the hardware part.

2020-09-17T15:44:01 hof -> naned
i.e. the bit rate doesn't matter?

2020-09-17T15:44:04 naned -> hof
no

2020-09-17T15:44:20 naned -> hof
I made two versions, x64 and x86

2020-09-17T15:44:34 hof -> naned
Okay, I see now.

2020-09-17T15:45:15 naned -> hof
they both work, only 32 only works on a 32 bit system, 64 only on 64 bit, I was told by the booza to do without flexibility

2020-09-17T15:45:40 naned -> hof
In fact, here if (PlatformInfo.PCHPlatformInfo.vid != 0x8086)
		return ERROR_VID;

2020-09-17T15:45:55 naned -> hof
chipset vendor ID

2020-09-17T15:46:05 naned -> hof
it is always x8086 at Intel

2020-09-17T15:46:46 hof -> naned
ok

2020-09-17T15:46:46 naned -> hof
You probably don't have an Intell matenrene

2020-09-17T15:46:56 hof -> naned
I tested it on a virtual machine.

2020-09-17T15:47:00 naned -> hof
Ð°

2020-09-17T15:47:02 naned -> hof
see

2020-09-17T15:47:12 naned -> hof
that's a separate song.

2020-09-17T15:47:21 naned -> hof
Virtualbox?

2020-09-17T15:48:26 hof -> naned
yes

2020-09-17T15:48:40 naned -> hof
there is a post on gitlab about testing, so virtualbox and vmvare have chipset emulation, but they are old (2006, vmvare, so '97)

2020-09-17T15:48:59 naned -> hof
in virtualbox there are 2 chipsets, one amd the other intel

2020-09-17T15:49:09 hof -> naned
clearly

2020-09-17T15:49:22 naned -> hof
Intel is ICH9

2020-09-17T15:49:59 hof -> naned
there is a small error in the data transfer, please redo it like this

CHAR buf[1024];
lstrcpyA(buf,OBFUSCATED("NoIntelPlatform"));
lpEventCallback(hModuleHandle, OBFUSCATED("ErrorInitPlatform"), buf, NULL, 0, OBFUSCATED("Tag"), lpEventContext);

2020-09-17T15:50:15 hof -> naned
just copied from the process 1024 bytes

2020-09-17T15:50:52 naned -> hof
got it

2020-09-17T15:52:16 naned -> hof
I'll drop it off tomorrow, okay?

2020-09-17T15:52:41 hof -> naned
Yes, not urgent.

2020-09-17T15:53:50 naned -> hof
I already wrote booze, to debug exactly the useful part of this tool does not work very well on a virtual machine

2020-09-17T15:54:31 hof -> naned
Yes, I understand now.

2020-09-18T08:28:27 naned -> hof
Hi, did I understand correctly, everywhere in lpEventCallback parameter pszEventInfo to pass 1024 bytes?

2020-09-18T08:28:52 naned -> hof
pointer to a stack with an array of 1024 bytes

2020-09-18T08:34:14 hof -> naned
hi, yes, not necessarily on the stack, but the buffer size is 1024 bytes

2020-09-18T08:34:30 naned -> hof
got it

2020-09-18T08:40:11 naned -> hof
and the rest of the LPCSTR pointer parameters don't need to be expanded to 1024 bytes?

2020-09-18T08:40:55 naned -> hof
there is a list of parameters:
 typedef VOID (__stdcall *RemoteEventCallback)(PVOID hModuleHandle, LPCSTR pszEventName, LPCSTR pszEventInfo,
  PVOID pvOutData, DWORD dwOutDataSize, LPCSTR pszOutDataTag, PVOID pvContext);

2020-09-18T08:41:05 hof -> naned
you can extend there as well, but so far there have been no problems

hi

2020-10-19T10:54:07:07 naned -> hof
Hi, listen, is a run with the "PlatformCheckResult" collection planned?

2020-10-19T10:54:28 hof -> naned
hi

2020-10-19T10:54:39 hof -> naned
can't you do it without it?

2020-10-19T10:55:21 naned -> hof
in fact, all the information collected is just a list of chipsets, you can see how they are protected by PlatformCheckResult

2020-10-19T10:56:07 hof -> naned
ok, let's try to build

2020-10-19T10:56:54 naned -> hof
The only thing, I also tested a little on my machines and changed the approach, I'll prepare new versions and drop them to you now

2020-10-19T10:57:53 hof -> naned
i.e. you need to run a new version?

2020-10-19T10:58:02 naned -> hof
well better her

2020-10-19T10:58:14 naned -> hof
If it's not too much of a hassle

2020-10-19T10:59:10 hof -> naned
Then instead of tag PlatformInfo write P0 or P1 or P3 directly in the tag

2020-10-19T10:59:18 naned -> hof
ok

2020-10-19T10:59:27 hof -> naned
it will be easier to sample

2020-10-19T11:00:56 naned -> hof
I see, but there was still an "InitError" error on 10?

2020-10-19T11:01:42 hof -> naned
I don't remember anymore.
