[16.06.21 09:33:43] dash: I did so far only for .exe and x32, without substitution of the parent process + without obfuscation of strings, because when compiling with msvc 2017-2019 stub is generated with a bunch of invalid operations, still do not understand what's wrong, only msvc 2008-2010)
[16.06.21 09:40:49] dash: https://mega.nz/file/rU4UTAiC#ifsIzZepiw4vn3E75izDLg-1mCKyV6IfvkT8ivw4YjA

[02.09.21 11:25:40] silver: tz
[02.09.21 11:28:07] silver: the same tz got fish
[02.09.21 11:28:40] silver: maybe you guys will do it together, I haven't decided yet
[02.09.21 11:28:49] silver: while you read, think and talk
[02.09.21 11:29:13] dash: Okay.
[06.10.21 11:43:56] dash: Hi, do you store locker settings in resources?
[06.10.21 11:44:43] dash: And what does the special list for files to delete look like?
[06.10.21 11:44:59] dash: Are there file names and extensions?
[06.10.21 12:02:03] silver: hi
[15.10.21 09:15:40] silver: hi
[15.10.21 09:15:54] dash: Hi.
[15.10.21 09:16:00] silver: otr
[15.10.21 09:16:23] silver: how's the locker?
[15.10.21 09:16:55] dash: it's going fine, I'm dealing with network search and file handling now)
[15.10.21 09:17:26] silver: when will you get the beta?
[15.10.21 09:19:54] dash: If there is no builder and no security measures, the approximate beta period is about a week and a half or two weeks
[15.10.21 09:20:16] silver: mvp without anything?
[15.10.21 09:20:23] dash: I'm gonna take the bilder from the crypter and redo it a bit
[10.15.21 09:24:21] dash: Yes, for now, but I'll try to make a minimal mvp so I can test it comfortably)
[15.10.21 09:24:38] dash: By the way, what about the settings I asked above?
[15.10.21 09:24:40] silver: ok, then wait for Halloween demo
[15.10.21 09:24:59] silver: > Hi, do the locker settings store in resources?
no, not in resources
[15.10.21 09:25:13] silver: resources are old school and just bait for detects
[15.10.21 09:25:22] silver: store in internal variables in your code, hardcode
[15.10.21 09:29:35] dash: Good)
[15.10.21 09:30:04] silver: repeat
[15.10.21 09:30:56] dash: I wrote: ok to your Halloween message)
[15.10.21 09:31:06] silver: okay.
[10.15.21 09:31:22] dash: About storing data, that's why I asked, because I also thought, that resources are too pale)
[15.10.21 09:31:48] silver: in general it's better to keep the minimum in the settings and give everything you can from the comstring
[15.10.21 09:32:03] silver: in hardcode it's better to keep lists by default minimal
[15.10.21 09:32:11] silver: like not to process %WINDIR%
[10.15.21 09:32:12] dash: And what about special list to delete, what does it look like?
[15.10.21 09:32:22] silver: just list of files
[15.10.21 09:32:37] silver: all lists are path lists
[15.10.21 09:33:26] dash: Got it.
[02.11.21 19:57:07] dash: Hi, I thought Stout warned you, sorry to be out of the timeline, I got corona, fever 39.7, very bad in general, will probably put me in the hospital for a while. Stout said, I can be treated while on paid sick leave, hope you approve it, I promise, I will finish and make a great locker
[03.11.21 07:56:54] silver: Hi.
[03.11.21 07:56:56] silver: yeah, i didn't know

[11/17/2011/2011 21 11:56:24] dash: I had 60% lung damage, now it's 25%, I will be home to heal, my legs hurt a little, I had some shots, but overall I feel better)
[17.11.21 11:58:32] silver: Are you still on sick leave?
[17.11.21 12:01:42] dash: Nah, I'll start working tomorrow after lunch)
[17.11.21 12:02:03] silver: go to Frances for payroll
[11/17/21/221 12:04:35] dash: Okay. Thank you for letting me be on sick leave in peace, I am very grateful)
[17.11.21 12:07:33] silver: thank you.
[23.11.21 20:32:11] dash: Hi, found an interesting article with code
[11/23/11/21 20:32:13] dash: https://xakep.ru/2021/11/23/0day-lpe/
[09.12.21 14:34:27] silver: koo

[09.12.21 15:04:39] silver: give me a test drive )
