stern@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion email him about the test fee, it's a handler

2020-08-17T07:05:22 salamandra -> darc
And you can discuss all your work questions with him, too.

2020-08-17T07:06:01 salamandra -> darc
he's off-line now and will reply when he shows up

2020-08-17T07:06:08 darc -> salamandra
ok

2020-08-17T07:06:13 salamandra -> darc
it also happens at night

2020-08-17T07:06:41 darc -> salamandra
Do you have any rules for newcomers?

2020-08-17T07:06:53 salamandra -> darc
I don't know I'm not a coder.

2020-08-17T07:06:59 salamandra -> darc
you can discuss with him.

2020-08-17T07:07:03 darc -> salamandra
I mean the organizational stuff.

2020-08-17T07:07:09 salamandra -> darc
Well, the schedule is usually from 10 to 7 a.m.

2020-08-17T07:07:26 salamandra -> darc
he decides all this or redirects it to his direct supervisor

2020-08-17T07:07:48 darc -> salamandra
ok. waiting for his reply.

2020-08-17T07:08:01 salamandra -> darc

stern@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion

2020-08-17T10:40:29 salamandra -> darc
text him

2020-08-20T14:11:28 salamandra -> darc
are you still here?

2020-08-21T10:05:14 salamandra -> darc
are you still here?

2020-08-21T10:05:53 darc -> salamandra
Hi. I can't get in touch with him. there's an antispam bot there, apparently.

2020-08-21T10:07:56 salamandra -> darc
Can you see what I'm writing?

2020-08-21T10:08:12 darc -> salamandra
I see

2020-08-21T10:09:03 salamandra -> darc
did you ask him for authorization?

2020-08-21T10:09:25 salamandra -> darc
this is bullshit

2020-08-21T10:10:59 darc -> salamandra
yes requested

2020-08-21T10:11:13 darc -> salamandra
you sent me a new account, I tried to use it too

2020-08-21T10:11:37 salamandra -> darc
which one?

2020-08-21T10:11:44 salamandra -> darc
I might be confused.

2020-08-21T10:11:54 darc -> salamandra
 SIMS(image/png, 49950B, requires compliant client)

2020-08-21T10:12:14 salamandra -> darc
I can't find the name right now.

2020-08-21T10:12:21 darc -> salamandra
xoc

2020-08-21T10:12:29 salamandra -> darc
Man, that's another man's

2020-08-21T10:12:46 salamandra -> darc
logged in? with him

2020-08-21T10:13:56 darc -> salamandra
So which account should I use? darc or xoc?

2020-08-21T10:23:37 salamandra -> darc
first

2020-08-21T10:29:44 darc -> salamandra
what is stern's account?

2020-08-21T10:44:44 salamandra -> darc
stern@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion

2020-08-21T10:45:31 darc -> salamandra
I have exactly that

2020-08-21T10:47:34 salamandra -> darc
Did you ask him to authorize it?

2020-08-21T10:48:47 darc -> salamandra
Yes. Now I've asked again.

2020-08-21T10:50:11 salamandra -> darc
I remembered I first sent you the wrong account. In short, I myself am confused which one you sit from. wait a while to figure it out.

2020-08-21T10:50:28 darc -> salamandra
ok

2020-08-21T11:32:06 salamandra -> darc
let's do it again

2020-08-21T11:32:14 salamandra -> darc
which acct ch sent first?

2020-08-21T11:32:39 darc -> salamandra
this one darc

2020-08-21T11:34:46 salamandra -> darc
That's right, that's where you come in.

2020-08-21T11:35:06 darc -> salamandra
ok. what's next? how do you contact stern?

2020-08-21T11:36:06 salamandra -> darc
admin says he added it to the group yesterday

2020-08-21T11:36:10 salamandra -> darc
did you get into it?

2020-08-21T11:37:27 darc -> salamandra
there is some group, there are two contacts in it. you and stern

2020-08-21T11:42:10 salamandra -> darc
Yeah, I don't like it.

2020-08-21T11:43:29 darc -> salamandra
maybe it's just a messenger group

2020-08-21T12:00:47 darc -> salamandra
do you have a beginner's manual? how to prepare the workplace, something like that?

2020-08-21T12:02:03 salamandra -> darc
Not from me, from the one who will give you tasks and tutorials. first, you need to talk to Stern and you'll get 15k for the test, and then he will tell you everything

2020-08-21T12:03:10 salamandra -> darc
What the heck, you're not here, then stern, and I'm like a spoiled phone. so I wrote him to deal with it

2020-08-21T12:04:41 darc -> salamandra
Every time I saw him online I wrote him, but all the time spam bot and how to pass it I do not understand

2020-08-21T12:04:54 salamandra -> darc
The codes just fell out.

2020-08-21T12:05:04 salamandra -> darc
It means you are not authorized.

2020-08-21T12:05:30 darc -> salamandra
I once again requested the autorazation

2020-08-21T12:05:35 salamandra -> darc
do you have the off the record plugin turned on?

2020-08-21T12:05:47 salamandra -> darc
See if there is no checkmark

2020-08-21T12:06:42 salamandra -> darc
And after that, text him again.

2020-08-21T12:06:45 darc -> salamandra
I don't see that on the list.

2020-08-21T12:07:30 salamandra -> darc
bottom left where the arrow symbol is clicked

2020-08-21T12:07:38 salamandra -> darc
choose plugin settings

2020-08-21T12:07:44 salamandra -> darc
And there in the list will be

2020-08-21T12:08:43 darc -> salamandra
I got that, but there is no such line with that name

2020-08-21T12:08:56 darc -> salamandra

yeah

2020-08-21T12:10:37 darc -> salamandra
