Hi. I'm the new programmer. they sent me to you for an assignment

2020-09-07T10:03:09 darc -> hof
hi. shall we continue?

2020-09-07T10:05:12 hof -> darc
hi

2020-09-07T10:05:48 hof -> darc
Have you been given an assignment yet?

2020-09-07T10:05:55 darc -> hof
no

2020-09-07T10:06:19 hof -> darc
couple of minutes

2020-09-07T10:09:35 hof -> darc
any experience with winapi?

2020-09-07T10:09:44 darc -> hof
yes

2020-09-07T10:10:37 hof -> darc
is winhttp familiar?

2020-09-07T10:11:14 darc -> hof
never used

2020-09-07T10:12:02 hof -> darc
What did you use to access the internet?

2020-09-07T10:12:57 darc -> hof
qt libraries. winapi I have gui and sync

2020-09-07T10:13:18 darc -> hof
there was no need for a network in my designs

2020-09-07T10:14:32 darc -> hof
But I don't think there's anything too complicated for me. I've worked with sockets.

2020-09-07T10:14:52 hof -> darc
and scripting languages - cmd, jscript, vbs, powershell? which ones do you know well?

2020-09-07T10:15:55 darc -> hof
first two middles, the second two on june.

2020-09-07T10:16:19 darc -> hof
I'm more of a heavy language guy, c++, rust

2020-09-07T10:16:30 darc -> hof
heavy*

2020-09-07T10:16:48 hof -> darc
Do you know the PE file format well?

2020-09-07T10:17:49 darc -> hof
I don't know

2020-09-07T10:19:16 hof -> darc
Have you ever had to reverse?

2020-09-07T10:20:04 darc -> hof
by reversing what? the code from the executable?

2020-09-07T10:20:59 hof -> darc
yes, by restoring the c++ source code from an exe file

2020-09-07T10:21:26 hof -> darc
Do you know assembler well?

2020-09-07T10:22:04 darc -> hof
used to know it well, at the level of a 386 processor.

2020-09-07T10:22:24 darc -> hof
I haven't done code reversal, but I've seen it done with IDA

2020-09-07T10:22:45 hof -> darc
How much experience do you have as a programmer?

2020-09-07T10:23:23 darc -> hof
20 years

2020-09-07T10:27:29 hof -> darc
I don't know, have they warned you that we're not exactly doing legal work?

2020-09-07T10:27:39 darc -> hof
yes

2020-09-07T10:28:03 darc -> hof
so I have a question, should I read what precautions should be taken

2020-09-07T10:28:16 darc -> hof
But no one wants to give me an answer

2020-09-07T10:28:32 hof -> darc
precautions are at least a VPN

2020-09-07T10:28:51 hof -> darc
online through a VPN right now?

2020-09-07T10:29:10 hof -> darc
This is to hide your real ip

2020-09-07T10:29:41 darc -> hof
Now without WAPN

2020-09-07T10:29:49 darc -> hof
What kind of VPN do you need?

2020-09-07T10:30:27 hof -> darc
I will ask, you will be issued, but it's not all that fast, in a day or two

2020-09-07T10:30:46 hof -> darc
Have you ever worked with virtual machines?

2020-09-07T10:31:40 darc -> hof
Like vmware and virtualbox?

2020-09-07T10:31:55 darc -> hof
only as a user. i have not written anything under them

2020-09-07T10:32:12 darc -> hof
hadn't even considered such a possibility

2020-09-07T10:32:59 hof -> darc
here it is desirable to install the vmrtool, in it vs, or other ide you work on

2020-09-07T10:33:18 hof -> darc
disconnect the virtual machine from the network, and do all development work there

2020-09-07T10:34:12 darc -> hof
I'll put

2020-09-07T10:53:51 hof -> darc
once set, figure out winhttp, how to download data or file from the network GET requests, how to send data via POST request

2020-09-07T10:54:37 hof -> darc
first via http, then via https

2020-09-07T10:55:14 hof -> darc
have you ever done a backend?

2020-09-07T10:55:24 darc -> hof
Is there any list of contradictions in which I shouldn't start doing this?

2020-09-07T10:55:39 darc -> hof
backend had to do a lot of backend

2020-09-07T10:55:51 hof -> darc
What language is it in?

2020-09-07T10:56:06 hof -> darc
I mean really c++ &

2020-09-07T10:56:08 hof -> darc
?

2020-09-07T10:56:09 darc -> hof
C++, rust

2020-09-07T10:56:20 hof -> darc
Ah, okay.

2020-09-07T10:56:28 darc -> hof
You mean the web backend?

2020-09-07T10:56:33 hof -> darc
yes

2020-09-07T10:57:03 darc -> hof
I didn't do the web backend. I played around with PHP and javascript a bit.

2020-09-07T10:58:19 hof -> darc
localhost (127.0.0.1) is the easiest way to test network applications, like winhttp

2020-09-07T10:58:42 darc -> hof
create server and client clear

2020-09-07T10:59:06 darc -> hof
I used to do this when I was learning winsock a long time ago.

2020-09-07T10:59:18 hof -> darc
Write a small server in rust that will output a text file when requested to 127.0.0.1/test.txt

2020-09-07T10:59:57 hof -> darc
try to download through the browser, and then through winhttp in c++

2020-09-07T11:00:35 darc -> hof
Is there some list of contradictions where I shouldn't start doing this?

2020-09-07T11:00:36 hof -> darc
and use winapi only

2020-09-07T11:01:32 hof -> darc
the programs you are going to make are not exactly legal - loaders, backdoors, trojans

2020-09-07T11:02:18 hof -> darc
You don't get a pat on the head for that, you have to be very careful.

2020-09-07T11:02:49 hof -> darc
work via VPN, less yada yada about work

2020-09-07T11:03:02 hof -> darc
no social networking through wpn

2020-09-07T11:03:10 darc -> hof
And if I live outside of Russia, for example

2020-09-07T11:03:23 darc -> hof
I don't have any social media at all.

2020-09-07T11:04:02 hof -> darc
I have been working for a long time, no problems so far

2020-09-07T11:04:16 darc -> hof
ok

2020-09-07T11:04:20 hof -> darc
Work is remote, not too stressful.

2020-09-07T11:04:29 hof -> darc
But if you're curious about it yourself

2020-09-07T11:04:50 darc -> hof
I used to be very interested. let's see how it is now.

2020-09-07T11:04:57 hof -> darc
I mean interesting work

2020-09-07T11:05:34 hof -> darc
Then deal with winhttp, and read about PE file format

2020-09-07T11:06:07 darc -> hof
ok

2020-09-07T11:06:09 hof -> darc
you need to understand what happens in the system when you start an exe or dll file

2020-09-07T11:06:31 hof -> darc
what is the entry point, file sections, etc.

2020-09-07T11:07:44 hof -> darc
put a virtual machine, configure it, make a server to test a GET request in rust or c++, and write

2020-09-07T11:08:14 hof -> darc
Ordered a vpn, I'll send you the info in a few days.

2020-09-07T11:08:21 hof -> darc
Read about VPNs by the way.

2020-09-07T11:08:35 darc -> hof
What exactly do you want to read about VPN?

2020-09-07T11:09:51 hof -> darc
how to use correctly, how to disable webrtc in the browser

2020-09-07T11:21:42 darc -> hof
Is there a whole list of things you need to do to get your computer ready?

2020-09-07T11:22:38 hof -> darc
You mean like a virtual machine?

2020-09-07T11:23:14 darc -> hof
Well here's webRTC, VPN, VirtualBox without a network

2020-09-07T11:25:29 hof -> darc
1) install VirtualBox, create a virtual machine in it, win7 is enough

2020-09-07T11:25:50 darc -> hof
that's by assignment, I get it.

2020-09-07T11:26:03 hof -> darc
install in virtual machine vs, the necessary programs

2020-09-07T11:26:50 hof -> darc
and for now just read what it is, what it's for

2020-09-07T11:27:17 hof -> darc
and when I download the config, it will be possible to install a VPN

2020-09-07T11:27:54 hof -> darc
Then we'll talk about how to do it better.

2020-09-07T11:28:45 hof -> darc
webrtc is something you should disable in your browser so that you won't be spotted when you use the Vpn

2020-09-07T11:29:21 darc -> hof
OK

2020-09-08T05:53:31 darc -> hof
Hi. I did everything we agreed on yesterday.

2020-09-08T05:53:50 hof -> darc
hi
