[23.08.21 16:44:27] basil: greetings
[23.08.21 16:44:38] basil: test
[23.08.21 16:44:43] basil: that's better
[23.08.21 16:44:46] basil: better
[23.08.21 17:41:04] angelo: tell me about it
[23.08.21 17:41:09] angelo: perfect
[23.08.21 17:42:13] basil: I'm sorry. But it's a little irrelevant here. No complaints. It's OK.
[08/23/221 17:42:45] angelo: shit
[08.23.21 17:42:51] basil: No, it's personal.
[23.08.21 17:42:51] angelo: sorry, been busy
[08.23.21 17:42:57] angelo: At least two
[23.08.21 17:43:05] angelo: I love women bro
[23.08.21 17:43:07] angelo: )))
[23.08.21 17:43:33] basil: I wanted to buy myself some crypto. You ever buy it on exchange?
[23.08.21 17:43:44] angelo: sure.
[23.08.21 17:43:58] angelo: if you register, there is only Binance exchange
[23.08.21 17:44:51] angelo: which one are you planning?
[23.08.21 17:45:49] basil: There is some inner feeling that bitcoin will be a hundred. How much "for" it is difficult to say. That's why I decided to invest. In growth
[23.08.21 17:45:55] basil: but I never poked there
[23.08.21 17:46:11] basil: can you tell me how to do it?
[23.08.21 17:46:24] basil: because I don't understand anything. Complete zero.
[23.08.21 17:46:25] angelo: are you still here for long?
[23.08.21 17:46:35] angelo: well, it's pretty simple
[23.08.21 17:46:49] angelo: how much are you planning? +-
[23.08.21 17:47:03] angelo: i honestly would not recommend to buy bitcoins on the exchange
[23.08.21 17:47:22] angelo: the exchange is a very shaky place to keep for growth of large amounts
[23.08.21 17:47:38] angelo: why don't you want to buy via exchanger for your wallet?
[23.08.21 17:48:03] basil: Well, the commission is very high.
[23.08.21 17:48:05] angelo: it's not uncommon for our colleagues to break into exchangers))
[23.08.21 17:48:12] basil: They say it's better at the exchange
[23.08.21 17:48:35] angelo: And you look through bestchange.ru?
[23.08.21 17:49:04] basil: I withdrew via bestchange
[23.08.21 17:49:18] basil: but the commission. commission....
[23.08.21 17:49:25] angelo: go to binans, it's more stable exchange, but its situation is not stable
[23.08.21 17:49:34] angelo: my commissions are usually small
[23.08.21 17:49:43] angelo: you decided to invest millions there?
[23.08.21 17:49:53] basil: a few millions
[23.08.21 17:50:06] angelo: don't go to the exchange bro
[23.08.21 17:50:19] angelo: on the exchange, it's not your crypto
[23.08.21 17:50:32] angelo: well i buy and then into a wallet. Or is there some other option
[23.08.21 17:50:38] angelo: aah
[23.08.21 17:50:43] basil: ?
[23.08.21 17:50:45] angelo: you want to buy and purse
[23.08.21 17:50:49] angelo: right
[23.08.21 17:50:53] angelo: wait a second
[08.23.21 17:51:17] basil: yes exactly
[23.08.21 17:52:17] basil: waiting
[23.08.21 17:54:21] angelo: look, the exchange will also charge you 2-3% for input
[23.08.21 17:54:26] angelo: this must be taken into account
[23.08.21 17:54:54] angelo: the question is, you can hardly exchange 1 million rubles through an exchanger
[23.08.21 17:54:58] angelo: that's what sucks, they limit input
[23.08.21 17:56:23] basil: input or output?
[23.08.21 17:56:46] basil: they do
[23.08.21 17:56:48] basil: ?
[23.08.21 17:57:02] angelo: yeah
[23.08.21 17:57:07] angelo: you don't care
[23.08.21 17:57:14] angelo: I'll ask
[23.08.21 17:57:23] angelo: who entered and withdrew
[23.08.21 17:57:27] basil: Well, not tomorrow. But it must be quicker.
[23.08.21 17:57:42] basil: otherwise growth may end
[23.08.21 17:57:44] angelo: things are getting harder and harder with crypto
[23.08.21 17:57:54] angelo: somehow the bitch got up
[23.08.21 17:58:00] angelo: you're waiting for 100!
[23.08.21 17:58:05] angelo: soon
[23.08.21 17:58:20] basil: Well, look. 3 years ago I was off topic.
[23.08.21 17:58:52] basil: There's this guy. He's an Amer. It's not an insider's info. Just something to think about.
[8/23/221 17:58:56] basil: So.
[23.08.21 17:59:15] basil: remember, there was a crash somewhere in 2018?
[23.08.21 17:59:21] angelo: yeah
[23.08.21 17:59:22] basil: I think it's over
[23.08.21 17:59:28] basil: Thought
[23.08.21 17:59:43] basil: Bicoin is down. It's just a bubble.
[23.08.21 17:59:54] angelo: I see your point.
[23.08.21 18:00:08] basil: So he's really buying up.
[23.08.21 18:00:20] basil: I remember why
[23.08.21 18:00:29] basil: I fucked him up real bad back then
[23.08.21 18:00:37] basil: Like come on, come on
[23.08.21 18:00:39] basil: )))
[23.08.21 18:00:44] basil: with a smirk
[23.08.21 18:01:02] basil: he said at the time he'd be a hundred
[23.08.21 18:01:09] angelo: you are not the only one, but honestly, I had more people lose, a few became millionaires
[23.08.21 18:01:11] basil: How much for a hundred is the question
[23.08.21 18:01:33] angelo: It's hard not to sell
[23.08.21 18:01:38] angelo: And if you sell, then in time
[23.08.21 18:01:41] angelo: I've been trading for six months
[23.08.21 18:02:13] angelo: here's a blunt put in Monero coin on Friday, for storage, without any back soap....bats and +30% for two days
[23.08.21 18:03:03] angelo: BUT you should always understand one rule in trading, you have to clearly understand that the money can be lost (of course not all). But you need to understand it with a cool head.
[23.08.21 18:03:20] basil: I agree.
[23.08.21 18:03:25] angelo: I have tons of examples from the world of stocks and crypto
[23.08.21 18:03:37] angelo: it could be absolutely anything
[23.08.21 18:03:45] basil: I agree
[23.08.21 18:03:50] angelo: I've got 4K on crypto now
[23.08.21 18:03:59] angelo: i don't shoot, though it's my last dime )
[23.08.21 18:04:01] basil: but still, how to buy it?
[23.08.21 18:04:19] basil: preferably with minimal commission?
[23.08.21 18:04:27] basil: at least do a test?
[23.08.21 18:04:29] angelo: if I did it
[23.08.21 18:04:42] angelo: I did it through the exchange office
[23.08.21 18:04:47] angelo: if you're in a millionaire city
[23.08.21 18:05:06] angelo: exchange bounces
[23.08.21 18:05:26] angelo: on the same binance, there are a couple of services at binance, one of them is reporting to the tax
[23.08.21 18:05:57] angelo: register at binance
[23.08.21 18:06:05] angelo: look what's going on with the rules
[23.08.21 18:06:15] angelo: they often have their own rules
[23.08.21 18:06:46] basil: And from a bank account. And not from the card they can do?
[23.08.21 18:06:50] angelo: I poured cash into the exchanger, up to 100K-200K
[23.08.21 18:07:01] angelo: not sure, probably not
[23.08.21 18:07:17] angelo: All services use card accounts
[23.08.21 18:07:51] angelo: I ran to get watermelon
[23.08.21 18:08:00] basil: okay
[23.08.21 18:08:01] basil: okay
[23.08.21 18:08:03] angelo: if you register on binan, don't register) I'll give you the link
[23.08.21 18:08:08] angelo: wait till tomorrow
[23.08.21 18:08:14] basil: no problem
[23.08.21 18:08:15] basil: ok
[23.08.21 18:08:17] angelo: I'll ask a couple of guys.
[23.08.21 18:08:26] basil: okay. thanks.
[23.08.21 18:08:33] angelo: any way I can
[23.08.21 18:08:59] angelo: young man, we are russians, we don't cheat each other :D
[23.08.21 18:09:08] angelo: (c)
[23.08.21 19:22:20] angelo: so far it all comes down to bignance
[23.08.21 19:22:30] angelo: the most safe variant
[23.08.21 19:23:34] basil: you don't know. There, the money (specifically Athenian) goes only from the card or you can still bank transfer?
[23.08.21 19:23:46] angelo: from the card
[23.08.21 19:24:02] basil: well, also a variant
[23.08.21 19:25:07] angelo: 3.3 %
[23.08.21 19:25:14] angelo: direct
[23.08.21 19:25:18] angelo: without services
[23.08.21 19:27:04] angelo: also 3-3.5 % with services
[23.08.21 19:27:32] basil: `` How do I refill Binance via p
How to top up Binance via p2p

The method is only suitable for verified users. It is the easiest and most profitable on the exchange. There is no replenishment fee.

The p2p platform itself is a custom exchanger within binance. The advantage of the method is that the rate is created by the participants of the trade. You can choose the option to buy cryptocurrency that suits you.
```
[23.08.21 19:27:42] basil: there is something
[23.08.21 19:27:46] angelo: nope
[23.08.21 19:27:53] angelo: it's person to person
[23.08.21 19:28:03] angelo: not even thinking
[23.08.21 19:28:10] angelo: they just throw it all the way
[23.08.21 19:28:21] basil: yeah?
[23.08.21 19:28:25] angelo: on your account, start your money by yourself
[23.08.21 19:28:36] angelo: yes
[23.08.21 19:28:40] angelo: Anything happens
[23.08.21 19:28:45] angelo: a lot of things
[23.08.21 19:32:18] angelo: pass the maximum verification
[23.08.21 19:32:21] angelo: not 100K
[23.08.21 19:32:53] basil: It's a pity. It eats most of the money.
[23.08.21 19:33:41] angelo: you don't know what a big commission is
[23.08.21 19:33:46] angelo: when there was a boom in January
[23.08.21 19:33:50] angelo: up to 30%
[23.08.21 19:33:58] angelo: in exchange offices
[23.08.21 19:33:59] basil: pisetz!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[23.08.21 19:34:03] angelo: yeah
[23.08.21 19:34:10] basil: what a commission!
[23.08.21 19:34:15] angelo: a guy with 300K gave away 100K]
[23.08.21 19:34:31] basil: are these dollars?
[23.08.21 19:34:33] angelo: And 3.5 is not so much
[23.08.21 19:34:39] angelo: in rubles
[23.08.21 19:35:01] basil: well 30%!!!!!
[23.08.21 19:35:05] angelo: and people were changing when they got pissed off because of the great growth and left the bitcoin
[23.08.21 19:35:08] basil: just for nothing.......
[23.08.21 19:35:17] angelo: exchangers live very well
[23.08.21 19:35:24] angelo: I hope they don't shut them down
[23.08.21 19:35:35] angelo: they make a lot of money
[23.08.21 19:35:52] angelo: exchangers have $100 mill a day limits
[23.08.21 19:36:06] angelo: and it's only for one pair
[23.08.21 19:36:12] angelo: like Bitcoin/Sberbank
[23.08.21 19:36:33] basil: yeah..... People know how to work
[23.08.21 19:36:43] basil: nothing to say
[23.08.21 19:36:46] angelo: https://privnote.com/ylNsNUmA#W6EhKwzQ7
[23.08.21 19:36:49] angelo: here's the link ))
[23.08.21 19:37:07] angelo: I think there are huge risks, exchangers are obviously operating under the banks
[23.08.21 19:37:19] angelo: too much money
[23.08.21 19:37:33] angelo: They launder money through exchangers
[23.08.21 19:37:44] angelo: hardly a business from scratch
[23.08.21 19:38:43] basil: there are 3 top ones, a condidate and all beggars..... You should have opened your own exchanger.
[23.08.21 19:38:52] basil: People know how to live!
[23.08.21 19:39:00] basil: Candidate's Degree
[23.08.21 19:39:25] angelo: who has a PhD?
[23.08.21 19:39:26] angelo: I don't get it

[23.08.21 19:40:21] angelo: why am I so dumb?))
[23.08.21 19:40:28] angelo: What research institute?
[23.08.21 19:40:35] angelo: You're not needed there
[23.08.21 19:40:49] basil: I know. Only sons and daughters.
[23.08.21 19:41:06] angelo: A smart man shouldn't be poor a priori
[23.08.21 19:41:19] basil: some hereditary estates
[23.08.21 19:41:30] angelo: yes, and so everywhere
[23.08.21 19:42:02] angelo: I envy you clever ones
[08/23/221 19:42:09] angelo: sincerely
[23.08.21 19:42:23] basil: i.e. according to Karl Marx there are classes (workers, peasants) and classes (military, officials)
[23.08.21 19:42:49] angelo: it always was and seems to be
[23.08.21 19:42:56] basil: And if classes are naturally formed by themselves, according to the type of activity, estates are created artificially
[23.08.21 19:43:03] basil: By the state,
[23.08.21 19:43:43] basil: And all these states used to change more or less, but now they are only inherited
[23.08.21 19:43:55] angelo: not by reason
[23.08.21 19:44:00] basil: That's right
[23.08.21 19:44:02] angelo: Too bad, it leads to degradation
[23.08.21 19:44:23] angelo: I've heard and seen it myself
[23.08.21 19:44:49] basil: you know, by the way, there's a joke
[23.08.21 19:44:58] angelo: rash
[23.08.21 19:45:53] basil: formerly in the state institutions simply KEEPED sex life. Now they don't. Why not?! Because everyone is related to each other!
[23.08.21 19:46:13] angelo: ))))))
[08.23.21 19:46:16] angelo: That's right.
[23.08.21 19:46:29] angelo: although it wasn't an obstacle before
[23.08.21 19:46:34] angelo: in the bourgeoisie of Europe
[23.08.21 19:46:45] basil: well, they have their own atmosphere

[20.09.21 13:24:38] basil: I tried to get to my colleagues somehow. But I got no answer.
[20.09.21 13:24:41] basil: Unfortunately
[20.09.21 13:24:43] angelo: I have to try something, I'll throw it on the stand
[20.09.21 13:24:52] angelo: shit
[20.09.21 13:24:59] angelo: go chat with silver there
[20.09.21 13:25:08] angelo: he helps me reach out to my colleagues
[20.09.21 13:25:14] angelo: magic Silver ))
[20.09.21 13:25:32] basil: ok
[20.09.21 13:25:55] angelo: they'll do gallops now, like always!)
[20.09.21 13:25:57] angelo: gallop
[20.09.21 13:26:09] angelo: I'll have some soup and be all ears
[20.09.21 13:26:21] basil: no problem
[20.09.21 14:16:23] angelo: shit
[20.09.21 14:16:30] angelo: they closed the garden today for the crown
[20.09.21 14:16:31] angelo: bitches
[20.09.21 14:16:37] angelo: I'm here
[20.09.21 14:16:46] angelo: what happened? I don't get it.
[20.09.21 14:16:57] angelo: the kindergarten is under quarantine
[20.09.21 14:17:04] angelo: The kid's home
[9/20/19-21 14:17:59] basil: Be patient. It's hard, of course. I can't work at all when even a pet works.
[20.09.21 14:18:07] basil: Nearby.
[20.09.21 14:21:26] basil: what to do.... Now many people complain about quarantine. Even though they were complaining before.
[20.09.21 14:21:57] angelo: oh, man, we had chicken pox for two weeks
[20.09.21 14:22:39] basil: But on the other hand, it's a joy for a child not to go to kindergarten
[20.09.21 14:22:40] basil: ))
[20.09.21 14:23:02] angelo: No, he likes it there
[20.09.21 14:23:05] angelo: he's very communicative
[20.09.21 14:23:13] angelo: and he needs fun and excitement
[20.09.21 14:23:18] angelo: and we're not young anymore
[20.09.21 14:23:49] basil: well, apparently from my dad we got strong "soft-skills" as they say now
[20.09.21 14:24:08] angelo: never heard that expression
[20.09.21 14:24:11] angelo: why?
[20.09.21 14:24:29] basil: means good communication and people skills
[20.09.21 14:24:34] basil: very fashionable now
[20.09.21 14:24:41] basil: trendy term
[20.09.21 14:24:45] angelo: I had my birthday not long ago
[20.09.21 14:24:48] angelo: you must be getting old
[20.09.21 14:25:18] basil: yeah. i don't like birthdays either
[20.09.21 14:26:04] angelo: i outlived jesus
[20.09.21 14:26:09] angelo: like a couple of years
[20.09.21 14:27:00] basil: nothing personal, but you better not spread personal information here. Nick to what it is. Maybe de-anonymization.
[20.09.21 14:27:06] basil: no offense
[20.09.21 14:27:12] basil: Only good wishes
[20.09.21 14:27:24] angelo: I know
[20.09.21 14:27:26] angelo: you're right
[20.09.21 14:27:41] angelo: I'm not afraid of ours.
[20.09.21 14:27:48] angelo: the main thing is that strangers don't read logs
[20.09.21 14:28:25] basil: ok. let's wait until the server is up and doing spacers. I'll let you know. I'm just writing code right now. I have to focus. Don't get me wrong.
[20.09.21 14:28:44] angelo: I'm sorry.
[20.09.21 14:28:48] angelo: good luck

[9/20/221 17:21:38] basil: wait . Let me run it on mine.
[20.09.21 17:22:50] angelo: maybe I made a mistake somewhere ?
[20.09.21 17:23:08] basil: no. the server must not be configured correctly
[20.09.21 17:31:08] basil: I'll try mine
[20.09.21 17:31:37] basil: turn off your outlook
[20.09.21 17:33:07] basil: Listen. I have a request.
[20.09.21 17:33:27] basil: I have to make 3 test boxes. Preferably on mail.ru
[20.09.21 17:33:40] basil: can you do it?
[20.09.21 17:34:04] angelo: I'll try
[20.09.21 17:34:17] basil: okay. I'm at Seyab's for now
[20.09.21 17:34:19] angelo: but my service requires a phone number
[20.09.21 17:34:24] basil: myself
[20.09.21 17:34:27] basil: check
[20.09.21 17:42:21] angelo: doesn't let me register without number
[20.09.21 17:42:25] angelo: I can at inbox.lv
[20.09.21 17:42:35] angelo: I have one email - found it
[20.09.21 17:42:37] basil: ok. go there
[20.09.21 17:45:15] basil: I understand what the problem is. After bouncing on the server you have to wait another 5 minutes.
[20.09.21 17:45:46] angelo: why the pause?
[20.09.21 17:46:00] angelo: that is, if I did not wait all ? will not work at all ?
[20.09.21 17:46:22] basil: I do not remember exactly. But I think that's what the client wanted or our collective unconsciousness came to that conclusion.
[20.09.21 17:46:29] basil: yes.
[20.09.21 17:46:45] basil: it only concerns
[20.09.21 17:49:52] angelo: no, I who you pa you didn't wait 5 minutes and that's it ?!
[20.09.21 17:50:13] angelo: that's not smart
[20.09.21 17:50:31] basil: outlook activates. Then it pauses for 5 minutes. And then it sends out the mailing.
[20.09.21 17:52:31] basil: that's how it worked for me
[20.09.21 17:52:35] basil: The letter went out
[20.09.21 17:52:52] basil: let's try your side again
[20.09.21 17:53:03] basil: start on my command
[20.09.21 17:53:07] basil: Ready?
[20.09.21 17:53:11] angelo: okay.
[20.09.21 17:53:23] angelo: I'm gonna overload
[20.09.21 17:53:30] basil: waiting
[20.09.21 17:56:08] angelo: I am?
[20.09.21 17:56:18] basil: go ahead
[20.09.21 17:56:58] basil: yes. Waiting

[20.09.21 18:05:57] basil: all mail is gone. saw
[20.09.21 18:06:08] basil: now reboot.
[20.09.21 18:06:13] angelo: ok
[20.09.21 18:06:28] basil: starting the unlogged version
[20.09.21 18:06:38] basil: waiting
[20.09.21 18:07:48] angelo: start
[20.09.21 18:08:49] basil: okay. but next time, don't run it without my command
[20.09.21 18:08:59] angelo: shit
[20.09.21 18:09:02] angelo: sorry
[20.09.21 18:09:08] angelo: I got a tt over my ear
[20.09.21 18:09:13] angelo: literally
[20.09.21 18:09:15] angelo: distracting the hell out of me
[20.09.21 18:09:27] basil: it happens. but don't run it without command
[20.09.21 18:09:37] angelo: got it
[20.09.21 18:09:51] angelo: reboot ?
[20.09.21 18:10:03] basil: no. wait
[09/20/1921 18:10:28] basil: no. go ahead and reboot. don't start without command.

[20.09.21 18:24:17] angelo: 32 .....
[20.09.21 18:24:21] basil: today only exe and go to bed. Tomorrow dll.
[20.09.21 18:27:27] angelo: 32 bit is absent
[20.09.21 18:27:35] angelo: I'll find a separate outlook
[20.09.21 18:27:46] angelo: can i put 32 bit on 32 bit Windows ?
[20.09.21 18:27:48] angelo: don't worry
[20.09.21 18:28:21] basil: it doesn't matter. It is important that 32 bit is outlook
[20.09.21 18:30:12] angelo: Microsoft Office 2007 SP3 Enterprise
[20.09.21 18:30:17] angelo: will it work ?
[20.09.21 18:30:36] basil: better than 201
[20.09.21 18:30:41] basil: 2013
[20.09.21 18:30:56] basil: okay, see you tomorrow
[20.09.21 18:33:05] basil: we can't even see the address book send now.

[20.09.21 18:41:47] angelo: need a clean car
[20.09.21 18:41:57] angelo: not up where there are traces of 64 bit
[20.09.21 18:42:00] angelo: do it today
[20.09.21 18:42:04] angelo: prepare the car !
[20.09.21 18:42:09] basil: ok
[20.09.21 18:42:25] angelo: let the 32 bit office always be lying
[20.09.21 18:48:49] basil: If you are still on line and you got a chance to install 32bit office - let me know
[20.09.21 18:48:54] basil: let's try it too
[20.09.21 18:49:01] angelo: ok
[20.09.21 19:00:26] angelo: installation in progress
[20.09.21 19:00:39] basil: ok

[20.09.21 19:45:43] angelo: it's not activated
[20.09.21 19:45:47] angelo: not pirated

[21.09.21 10:21:59] basil: okay.
[21.09.21 10:25:21] angelo: sorry, I got up at 8 and haven't eaten yet
[21.09.21 10:29:50] basil: well. How do you feel in general?
[21.09.21 10:30:00] basil: I could have done it myself.
[21.09.21 10:30:07] angelo: all set
[21.09.21 10:30:13] angelo: I feel fine
[21.09.21 10:30:19] angelo: I wish I didn't lose my crown
[21.09.21 10:30:28] basil: ok. Question. Who is the developer of tric?
[21.09.21 10:30:41] angelo: by tric Caesar
[21.09.21 10:30:43] basil: I need to get the dll right
[21.09.21 10:30:46] angelo: all questions to him
[21.09.21 10:30:54] angelo: cesar
[21.09.21 10:31:15] basil: ok. i'll contact him now. As soon as he answers, let's try to run dll
[21.09.21 10:31:16] angelo: you want me to
[21.09.21 10:31:18] angelo: ok
[21.09.21 10:31:29] angelo: okay, I have a test run
[9/21/221 10:44:29] basil: okay. Okay. I'll compile the dll. I'll send it to you. Let's try it.
[21.09.21 10:44:45] angelo: ok.
[21.09.21 10:44:52] angelo: can i run tricks ?
[21.09.21 10:45:25] basil: yes, that's where we'll start
[21.09.21 10:46:08] basil: The folder C:\Temp must be created
[21.09.21 10:46:18] angelo: ok
[21.09.21 10:55:38] basil: t1O4nOPh78Omxok6qYsQPQ$HWfeMkC
[21.09.21 10:56:51] basil: https://file.io/Q3Ke3AXSBlL6
[21.09.21 10:57:41] basil: let me know when you're ready
[21.09.21 10:58:27] angelo: got it
[21.09.21 10:58:44] angelo: I'll deal with the bot now
[21.09.21 10:58:49] basil: waiting
[21.09.21 11:05:30] angelo: now I gotta fill in the ddla
[21.09.21 11:05:43] basil: waiting
[21.09.21 11:07:51] angelo: is there 64 possible ?
[21.09.21 11:08:07] angelo: two bits
[21.09.21 11:08:20] basil: is it necessary?
[21.09.21 11:08:28] angelo: yes
[21.09.21 11:08:52] angelo: tricks the bit depth
[21.09.21 11:09:10] basil: the dll itself is cross-bit
[21.09.21 11:09:23] angelo: the question is different, that's how a trick is built
[21.09.21 11:09:40] angelo: it sees 64 bit Windows and will address a 64 bit module on the server
[21.09.21 11:09:49] angelo: won't load 86
[21.09.21 11:10:20] basil: ok. And now we can check only 32 bit? Or take it out and put it in.
[21.09.21 11:10:22] angelo: I forgot, usually 64 is always loaded
[21.09.21 11:10:34] basil: put it on
[21.09.21 11:10:35] angelo: we can, I'll load 32
[21.09.21 11:10:42] basil: okay
[21.09.21 11:28:18] angelo: shit, my only 32bit windup is acting inadequately
[21.09.21 11:30:41] angelo: won't let me download anything to it
[21.09.21 11:30:42] angelo: did this happen ?
[21.09.21 11:31:06] basil: maybe download another torrent image
[21.09.21 11:31:07] basil: ?
[21.09.21 11:31:39] angelo: gonna reinstall guest
[21.09.21 11:31:43] angelo: maybe it failed
[21.09.21 11:31:52] angelo: 32 bit is rare
[21.09.21 11:32:11] basil: yeah, i'm pretty rare too
[21.09.21 11:39:11] angelo: working on the windup
[21.09.21 11:39:20] angelo: which ddla to upload to the server ?
[21.09.21 11:39:27] angelo: log or not
[21.09.21 11:39:35] basil: log of course
[21.09.21 11:55:02] angelo: how long to do 64? just in case
[21.09.21 11:56:13] basil: well, it will take some time.
[21.09.21 11:56:22] basil: I can't say exactly how long
[21.09.21 11:56:43] basil: but last time, as I remember with the customer we were only talking about exe
[21.09.21 12:12:42] basil: https://file.io/RNyegEqL3kJj
[21.09.21 12:12:48] basil: T%*98{lo0~j$~0ruf4F5{px|J{AxtK
[21.09.21 12:12:54] basil: dll - x64
[21.09.21 12:32:03] angelo: chic
[21.09.21 12:37:53] angelo: it's pouring now
[21.09.21 12:37:54] angelo: on the server
[21.09.21 12:38:03] angelo: it's hard to upload via lowader
[21.09.21 12:40:02] angelo: you think there is something you can do?
[21.09.21 12:40:16] angelo: that's how it's always been, and it's probably good for trike use
[21.09.21 12:40:43] basil: there I wrote a little message in the channel. I suggest we discuss it there
[21.09.21 12:40:59] basil: Have a brainstorming session
[21.09.21 12:41:10] angelo: ok, it's hard for me to write in such groups.......
[21.09.21 12:41:12] basil: I don't know how to be. For me it is a discovery today.
[21.09.21 12:41:41] angelo: probably no warning
[21.09.21 12:41:57] basil: that's it. It turns out
[21.09.21 12:41:59] angelo: he doesn't have multibit to boot
[21.09.21 12:42:16] basil: basically, the client didn't say anything about dll
[21.09.21 12:42:29] basil: but anything can happen
[21.09.21 12:42:52] angelo: I think it's not easy to do
[21.09.21 12:42:58] angelo: I have a client he was using a dll
[21.09.21 12:43:05] angelo: and then bam!
[21.09.21 12:43:16] angelo: so you have to be ready)
[21.09.21 13:01:26] angelo: so, caesar said not long yet
[21.09.21 13:01:35] angelo: and nruzim through the trick
[21.09.21 13:02:14] basil: well, we wait.
[21.09.21 13:05:58] angelo: Okay.
[21.09.21 13:05:59] angelo: everything
[21.09.21 13:06:10] angelo: can i upload ?
[21.09.21 13:06:25] basil: let's try
[21.09.21 13:06:29] angelo: ok
[21.09.21 13:06:32] angelo: I give the command to tric
[21.09.21 13:06:52] basil: wait
[21.09.21 13:07:09] basil: go ahead
[21.09.21 13:07:12] angelo: ok
[21.09.21 13:09:11] basil: it's like... on?
[21.09.21 13:09:18] angelo: ok
[21.09.21 13:09:27] angelo: I'm asking ces to trace it.
[21.09.21 13:09:38] angelo: there is a complicated system, they also encrypt the dll
[21.09.21 13:09:58] angelo: yes it should have run
[21.09.21 13:10:35] angelo: and logs in Temp should go immediately ?
[21.09.21 13:11:07] basil: well, after running dll, yes
[21.09.21 13:11:14] angelo: no

[21.09.21 13:51:53] basil: It's no longer relevant
[21.09.21 13:52:20] basil: outlook is still in process. Should have closed.
[21.09.21 13:52:46] angelo: it is not in the taskbar

[21.09.21 13:54:24] basil: no. no need log
[21.09.21 13:54:52] angelo: I think you can run it, just have trouble uploading the file to the server
[21.09.21 13:54:55] angelo: long time
[21.09.21 13:55:00] angelo: only caesar does that
[21.09.21 13:55:54] basil: he knocked and tried to send something

[21.09.21 13:57:23] angelo: why can't i open outlook ?
[21.09.21 13:57:31] angelo: because user can leave it open by himself
[21.09.21 13:57:46] angelo: if the outlook is active
[21.09.21 13:57:48] basil: that's why we wait 5 min
[21.09.21 14:00:42] basil: okay. that's it.

[21.09.21 14:03:00] angelo: i'm just a nervous wreck myself
[21.09.21 14:03:09] angelo: having been through a narcotic disease
[21.09.21 14:03:22] angelo: realized it's destructive to worry
[21.09.21 14:03:46] basil: well, I'll take it from))))
[21.09.21 14:05:00] angelo: believe me, I have a lot of illnesses on this ground, unfortunately I know what I'm saying, without any figurative expressions and assumptions

[22.09.21 11:24:27] angelo: just in case you got the wrong code
[22.09.21 11:25:08] angelo: does martin say anything ?
[22.09.21 11:25:15] angelo: what is he supposed to do
[22.09.21 11:25:22] angelo: address
[22.09.21 11:25:54] basil: actually there should be a mapping of the address book there. but not yet
[22.09.21 11:26:07] basil: I asked him about it yesterday
[22.09.21 11:27:42] angelo: let him give me a deadline if he's ready
[22.09.21 11:27:45] angelo: It seems to be burning
[22.09.21 11:30:56] basil: I've been asking for procs all last week, and you're telling me
[22.09.21 11:31:10] basil: until I told my boss...
[22.09.21 11:31:21] angelo: I understand you
[22.09.21 11:31:25] basil: But I didn't feel like it
[22.09.21 11:31:28] angelo: I understand you very well
[22.09.21 11:31:41] angelo: I don't like to do it, but I rarely have to
[22.09.21 11:32:23] angelo: you'll be held responsible
[22.09.21 11:32:32] angelo: that's why it's a last resort
[22.09.21 11:33:39] basil: okay.
[22.09.21 11:33:50] basil: I haven't gotten any mail yet
[22.09.21 11:33:53] basil: waiting
[22.09.21 11:34:26] angelo: yesterday I was asked to test one module on the farms, I could score and otlodit, but did until 1:30 to give me a report today. Sometimes you wonder why you do that...
[22.09.21 11:34:30] angelo: ok
[22.09.21 11:34:48] angelo: no one will appreciate it, but the man is waiting
[22.09.21 11:35:15] basil: yes. The scheme is very popular.
[22.09.21 11:35:25] angelo: which one?
[22.09.21 11:35:32] angelo: postpone ?)
[22.09.21 11:36:05] basil: no. the scheme is called "feed all night - slaughter in the morning"
[22.09.21 11:36:23] basil: When they say - reports, urgent, etc.
[22.09.21 11:36:29] angelo: Aah!
[22.09.21 11:36:43] angelo: no, i was just asked for help by a guy) couldn't refuse or give up
[22.09.21 11:36:53] angelo: not the boss
[22.09.21 11:37:14] basil: well, it could be too
[22.09.21 11:41:45] basil: there is
[22.09.21 11:41:48] basil: the letter went out
[22.09.21 11:41:56] basil: great
[22.09.21 11:47:48] angelo: already good
[22.09.21 13:51:03] angelo: I'm cutting off vm ?
[22.09.21 13:55:32] basil: I think so. Apparently the concept has changed)))
[22.09.21 13:55:51] angelo: repeat
[22.09.21 13:55:54] angelo: not at all
[22.09.21 13:56:02] basil: I think so. Apparently the concept has changed)))
[22.09.21 13:56:12] angelo: which one?
[22.09.21 13:56:30] basil: today is the deadline
[22.09.21 13:56:37] basil: what's everyone's silence
[22.09.21 13:56:38] angelo: ah
[22.09.21 13:56:44] basil: something
[22.09.21 13:56:47] angelo: go to general chat
[22.09.21 13:56:51] angelo: spambot
[22.09.21 13:56:55] angelo: bravely
[22.09.21 13:57:09] angelo: I can
[22.09.21 13:57:17] basil: I don't think so
[22.09.21 13:57:25] basil: our part seems ready
[22.09.21 13:57:34] basil: just a cross-digit trick
[22.09.21 13:57:36] angelo: but we have to check it
[22.09.21 13:57:41] basil: just a little let down
[22.09.21 13:57:45] angelo: how does he leak addresses
[22.09.21 13:57:51] angelo: isn't it?
[22.09.21 13:58:05] angelo: into admin
[22.09.21 13:58:11] basil: martin showed me the data coming to him
[22.09.21 13:58:27] basil: there's no graphical interface
[22.09.21 13:58:34] basil: And the data comes
[22.09.21 13:58:39] basil: we checked it
[22.09.21 13:58:47] angelo: okay then
[22.09.21 13:59:00] angelo: so basically you have to finish the GUI of the admin area
[22.09.21 13:59:06] basil: yeah
[22.09.21 13:59:22] angelo: well, and the strokes, without them nothing
[22.09.21 13:59:26] basil: there's a problem with outlook
[22.09.21 13:59:45] basil: I'm afraid we can't help you there
[22.09.21 13:59:57] basil: well, and "shtichii" of course)))
[22.09.21 14:00:01] basil: What without them
[22.09.21 14:00:11] basil: I'm telling you like in the army
[22.09.21 14:00:25] basil: "All night to feed - to slaughter"
[22.09.21 14:00:53] angelo: i honestly haven't heard that expression.)
[22.09.21 14:00:59] angelo: only from you
[22.09.21 14:01:07] angelo: and did not serve
[22.09.21 14:01:12] angelo: glad I did
[22.09.21 14:01:14] basil: there's a joke
[22.09.21 14:01:36] basil: The general is coming tomorrow. We must make a shish kebab.
[22.09.21 14:01:46] basil: There's a lean lamb in the meadow
[22.09.21 14:01:46] angelo: Yeah, I get the point.)
[22.09.21 14:01:57] basil: What to do?
[22.09.21 14:02:15] basil: well, "feed all night - slaughter in the morning"
[22.09.21 14:02:17] basil: ))
[22.09.21 14:02:17] angelo: feeding)
[22.09.21 14:02:31] basil: such peculiar humor
[22.09.21 14:02:36] angelo: yes, from the point of view of dyeing grass for the arrival
[22.09.21 14:02:45] angelo: this is more than humor
[22.09.21 14:03:06] angelo: it shows very well the mentality of the country where this humor
[22.09.21 14:03:24] angelo: self-irony has always been good for us
[22.09.21 14:03:53] angelo: And so it should be (about weed). By the way.... Strangely enough. Otherwise there starts all sorts of hazing. But when everyone's fucked up, there's less bad thoughts.
[22.09.21 14:04:06] basil: The phrase about weed is absurd
[22.09.21 14:04:19] angelo: there is a phrase about fucked up soldier as a norm
[22.09.21 14:04:32] angelo: joke again
[22.09.21 14:04:58] angelo: I always was sure that a soldier must be fucked up like a soldier
[22.09.21 14:05:15] Basil: It's not nice. For a soldier. But it's better for him to be 'fucked up' than for him to have bad thoughts when he's armed.
[22.09.21 14:05:50] angelo: And how easy it is to teach a soldier to be a soldier, isn't it?)
[22.09.21 14:06:21] angelo: I look at the French Legion and am amazed by all these activities
[22.09.21 14:06:22] basil: maybe. I do not approve.
[22.09.21 14:06:31] angelo: they are very good with it
[22.09.21 14:06:43] basil: I knew someone from that legion
[22.09.21 14:06:49] basil: He says - better not
[22.09.21 14:07:08] angelo: I've got enough who's tami and us, there's less fartuna than us
[22.09.21 14:07:28] angelo: But I didn't go anywhere and don't intend to.)
[22.09.21 14:07:40] basil: That's what I think.
[22.09.21 14:08:05] basil: Stereo system, mahogany furniture, 100 square meters, in penthouse
[22.09.21 14:08:10] basil: villa on the beach
[22.09.21 14:08:20] basil: I like that one too
[22.09.21 14:08:24] angelo: can we do this?)
[22.09.21 14:08:35] angelo: I would like it very much]

[22.09.21 14:08:56] basil: Ahaha))))))))))))))))))))))
[22.09.21 14:09:03] angelo: ))))
[22.09.21 14:09:04] basil: Right on!
[22.09.21 14:09:59] basil: Okay. you did your part. And the rest of us and the bosses as they please.
[22.09.21 14:10:32] angelo: that's it, the main thing is that the bosses know
[22.09.21 14:10:45] angelo: maybe write in the group?
[22.09.21 14:10:50] angelo: so and so everything is fine
[22.09.21 14:11:02] basil: okay. Let me write.
[22.09.21 14:11:10] angelo: I'm afraid of these bands
[22.09.21 14:11:12] angelo: I can too
[22.09.21 14:11:23] angelo: just really ashamed to write, I'm afraid to look silly
[22.09.21 14:11:31] basil: okay. let me do it. Although I'm a little worried too.
[22.09.21 14:11:55] angelo: write it down, I'll send it myself
[22.09.21 14:12:01] angelo: I kinda have to sign out too
[22.09.21 14:12:08] angelo: like I participated
[22.09.21 14:12:10] basil: And if so...
[22.09.21 14:12:19] angelo: even though it's like five paws of a cat
[22.09.21 14:16:58] basil: ``
Greetings all!
Made tethers runs for mybot. The bot is authorized correctly on the server. Separately checked data transfer from address book to server. The data is coming. But at the moment there is no graphical interface for their displaying on the server.
Exe (cross bit) - works.
Dll (separately 32 and 64 bit version) - works through the trick.

[22.09.21 14:17:04] basil: Something like this

[22.09.21 14:18:02] angelo: I would have written it that way, I think word for word
[22.09.21 14:18:36] basil: it's okay.
[22.09.21 14:19:54] basil: If you will write. It's better now or around 19:30. I'll have to leave at 18:15.
[22.09.21 14:20:05] basil: I'll have to
[22.09.21 14:20:24] angelo: now
[22.09.21 14:20:58] basil: it'll be fine. I don't like this publicity sometimes either.
[22.09.21 14:22:37] angelo: thank you !
[22.09.21 14:22:46] angelo: no, i have an impostor complex
[22.09.21 14:22:47] basil: it's okay.
[22.09.21 14:22:59] angelo: you know what I'm thinking
[22.09.21 14:23:20] angelo: when you are sure that you know nothing, you know nothing and in general you are nothing....
[22.09.21 14:23:40] basil: that makes sense
[22.09.21 14:24:39] basil: I'll make the binary
[22.09.21 14:24:49] angelo: well, that's why I'm afraid to write for public review
[22.09.21 14:24:49] basil: whatever you have too

[22.09.21 14:25:02] angelo: what did you give

[22.09.21 14:27:09] basil: not enough
[22.09.21 14:27:11] basil: now
[22.09.21 14:27:25] angelo: mailbot.dll
[22.09.21 14:27:31] angelo: in the folder

[22.09.21 14:27:45] basil: that's not it
[22.09.21 14:29:27] basil: can you read it?
[22.09.21 14:29:40] angelo: what exactly ?
[22.09.21 14:29:59] angelo: sorry, I'm missing the point.)
[22.09.21 14:30:02] basil: so you can

[22.09.21 14:43:37] angelo: I mean me
[22.09.21 14:44:10] basil: fill in the dll on the trike. In the appropriate bit mode
[22.09.21 14:44:20] angelo: the thing you threw in there are two folders with dll only
[22.09.21 14:44:24] angelo: ok
[22.09.21 14:44:29] basil: I'll probably be there at 20:00 MSK
[22.09.21 14:44:48] basil: One more time
[22.09.21 14:44:51] basil: pour the dll on the trike. In the appropriate bit mode
[22.09.21 14:45:06] angelo: you threw 32 now
[22.09.21 14:45:13] basil: Yes
[22.09.21 14:45:35] angelo: got it and those 64 from yesterday
[22.09.21 14:45:41] basil: But you had mailbot64.dll or not?
[22.09.21 14:45:46] basil: all read
[22.09.21 14:45:49] angelo: was yes
[22.09.21 14:46:00] angelo: and ekse yesterday too
[22.09.21 14:46:01] angelo: got it
[22.09.21 14:46:10] basil: yes exe yesterday
[22.09.21 14:46:29] basil: just to have the binary at hand
[22.09.21 14:46:43] basil: Last time we'll run it. And probably give it to customer.
[22.09.21 14:46:56] angelo: got it.
[22.09.21 14:47:35] basil: okay. I'll hang up now.
[22.09.21 14:47:50] basil: I'll be there soon. Well, not really soon, but I'll be there.
[22.09.21 14:48:01] angelo: go ahead
[22.09.21 14:48:06] angelo: no problem at all
[22.09.21 14:48:07] angelo: )
[22.09.21 16:38:10] basil: hello
[22.09.21 16:38:13] basil: Again.
[22.09.21 16:38:24] basil: Let me know when you're free
[22.09.21 16:38:30] basil: available
[22.09.21 16:48:59] angelo: what are our tasks?
[22.09.21 16:49:00] angelo: okay
[22.09.21 16:49:03] angelo: comrade general
[22.09.21 16:53:26] basil: well, we need to check everything one last time. And make an archive with binary
[22.09.21 16:53:30] basil: can we?
[22.09.21 16:53:48] basil: we won't check sending emails
[22.09.21 16:54:06] angelo: ok
[22.09.21 16:54:08] basil: server registration
[22.09.21 16:54:12] angelo: 64
[22.09.21 16:54:23] basil: dll?
[22.09.21 16:54:42] angelo: yeah
[22.09.21 16:54:46] angelo: we can
[22.09.21 16:54:53] angelo: where to start ?
[22.09.21 16:55:18] basil: let's start with exe
[22.09.21 16:55:23] basil: Do you have a car?
[22.09.21 16:55:30] basil: With office
[22.09.21 16:55:46] angelo: of course, she's not going anywhere)
[22.09.21 16:55:50] angelo: went
[22.09.21 16:56:28] basil: ok. And the office there you can do first 32 bit and then 64 bit in 2 runs. First the first and then the second
[22.09.21 16:56:30] angelo: and how to make an archive with binaries?
[22.09.21 16:56:37] angelo: all packed in one archive ?
[22.09.21 16:56:53] angelo: well, 32 I wonder if I can or can't
[22.09.21 16:57:08] basil: then I'll run it on mine
[22.09.21 16:57:23] basil: about the archive
[22.09.21 16:57:27] basil: okay
[22.09.21 16:58:02] basil: you have 2 exe, 2 x64 dll and 2 x32 dll?
[22.09.21 16:58:15] angelo: yeah
[22.09.21 16:58:26] angelo: so we run unlogged as I understand
[22.09.21 16:58:31] basil: yes
[22.09.21 16:58:38] basil: illogical
[22.09.21 16:58:47] angelo: tell me when to run
[22.09.21 16:59:06] basil: office is 64 bit?
[22.09.21 16:59:14] angelo: yes
[22.09.21 16:59:26] basil: ok.
[22.09.21 17:00:10] basil: go ahead
[22.09.21 17:00:35] angelo: start
[22.09.21 17:02:14] basil: fine. Save the file separately . In a folder of some kind.
[22.09.21 17:02:54] basil: let me know when you do it.
[22.09.21 17:04:06] angelo: saved everything
[22.09.21 17:04:11] angelo: 6 files into archive
[22.09.21 17:05:49] basil: so we have 6 files. 2 exe (logged and illogical), 2 x64 dll (logical and illogical) and 2 x32 dll (logical and illogical)
[22.09.21 17:05:56] basil: everything is correct? Yes?
[22.09.21 17:09:23] basil: something is missing, send it again?
[22.09.21 17:09:57] angelo: yes
[22.09.21 17:09:59] angelo: all right
[22.09.21 17:11:12] basil: great))
[22.09.21 17:12:28] basil: Now you can put it all into archive. I'll password protect it. And I must upload it to some file sharing site so that this file was not deleted at the first download
[22.09.21 17:12:37] basil: qaz.im?
[22.09.21 17:12:45] basil: How about it?
[22.09.21 17:13:31] angelo: don't
[22.09.21 17:13:31] angelo: hmm
[22.09.21 17:13:39] angelo: now
[22.09.21 17:15:07] angelo: quiz is not a good solution
[22.09.21 17:15:10] angelo: but go for it
[22.09.21 17:15:23] angelo: better password, longer password
[22.09.21 17:15:46] basil: http://www.onlinepasswordgenerator.ru/
[22.09.21 17:15:55] basil: 40 characters
[22.09.21 17:16:08] basil: feel free to)))))
[22.09.21 17:19:29] angelo: did it
[22.09.21 17:19:37] angelo: so what about the exe file ?
[22.09.21 17:19:37] angelo: all ?
[22.09.21 17:19:52] basil: yes 6 files
[22.09.21 17:20:14] angelo: i'm checking now
[22.09.21 17:20:18] angelo: running eczema
[22.09.21 17:20:22] angelo: now I can do it with a trick ?
[22.09.21 17:20:30] basil: yes. go ahead.
[22.09.21 17:20:43] basil: almost forgot
[22.09.21 17:20:54] basil: my head isn't working anymore. Sorry
[22.09.21 17:21:30] angelo: )
[22.09.21 17:21:36] angelo: I have tricks on
[22.09.21 17:21:41] angelo: there's a different module
[22.09.21 17:21:46] angelo: one does not prevent the other
[22.09.21 17:22:02] angelo: hell no
[22.09.21 17:22:05] angelo: no weaning there
[22.09.21 17:22:06] angelo: now
[22.09.21 17:22:10] angelo: a couple of minutes I'll trick
[22.09.21 17:27:33] angelo: starting ?
[22.09.21 17:27:59] basil: yes
[22.09.21 17:28:54] basil: yes
[22.09.21 17:29:04] basil: is it 32 bit ?
[22.09.21 17:29:19] angelo: 64
[22.09.21 17:29:31] basil: ok. can we do 32?
[22.09.21 17:29:56] angelo: I'll tell you in 5 minutes
[22.09.21 17:30:05] angelo: I think I can upload files to 32
[22.09.21 17:30:11] angelo: give me 5 minutes
[22.09.21 17:30:14] basil: waiting
[22.09.21 17:30:17] basil: ok
[22.09.21 17:48:50] angelo: no
[22.09.21 17:48:52] angelo: not getting up 32
[22.09.21 17:48:53] angelo: duh
[22.09.21 17:49:07] angelo: try a new one
[22.09.21 17:49:30] angelo: do you want to give archive to whom?
[22.09.21 17:50:02] basil: do you think tomorrow we can test 32 bit dll?
[22.09.21 17:50:09] angelo: yeah
[22.09.21 17:50:16] angelo: I'll get ready
[22.09.21 17:50:28] basil: okay. let's do it this way
[22.09.21 17:50:37] angelo: ok
[22.09.21 17:51:00] basil: save binary in a separate folder. Don't forget.
[22.09.21 17:51:02] basil: That's it.
[22.09.21 17:51:07] basil: No more distractions
[22.09.21 17:51:27] basil: you can try to relax
[22.09.21 17:51:34] basil: at least try...
[22.09.21 17:51:43] angelo: that's it, all 6 binary books are on my shelf
[22.09.21 17:51:45] angelo: don't worry
[22.09.21 17:51:52] angelo: gotta make dinner)
[22.09.21 17:51:55] angelo: don't relax
[22.09.21 17:52:13] basil: yeah. by the way. I'm hungry too.
[22.09.21 17:52:25] basil: okay. I'm done for the day. thanks.
[22.09.21 17:52:31] angelo: you're welcome.)
[22.09.21 17:52:39] angelo: i envy those who know how to order takeout !
[22.09.21 17:52:46] angelo: I can't
[22.09.21 17:52:54] angelo: only for holidays
[22.09.21 17:53:02] angelo: trouble with the cook )
[22.09.21 17:53:41] angelo: and I can finally order arduino in peace !
[22.09.21 17:53:48] angelo: I've been trying to do it for a month
[22.09.21 17:54:56] basil: I like it better
[22.09.21 17:54:57] basil: https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/virtex-7.html
[22.09.21 17:55:11] basil: but of course to each his own
[22.09.21 17:55:22] angelo: I'll take esp32 in general
[22.09.21 17:55:36] angelo: you need wifi and bluetooth built in
[22.09.21 17:56:02] angelo: the things you discounted are for clever...
[22.09.21 17:56:41] basil: you can make your own architecture processor on it
[22.09.21 17:56:47] basil: well, for your taste
[22.09.21 17:56:53] basil: sure
[22.09.21 17:57:01] angelo: I'm trying to make cars and carts
[22.09.21 17:57:04] angelo: =)
[22.09.21 17:57:21] basil: well, then yes. Arduino okay)))
[22.09.21 17:57:40] angelo: I don't know a thing about it, I'll learn
[22.09.21 17:57:47] angelo: set an example so to speak
[22.09.21 17:58:11] basil: for starters arduino is the best. Right choice
[22.09.21 17:58:40] angelo: now I'll learn the programming by real example
[22.09.21 17:58:50] angelo: not just learn the language in the abstract
[22.09.21 17:59:43] basil: That's a good start. I used to dabble in arduino, too. But now they say it is way ahead of the curve.
[22.09.21 18:01:51] angelo: esp32 seems to be the most popular now
[22.09.21 18:02:03] angelo: more powerful, more functional and cheaper
[22.09.21 18:02:42] basil: honestly, nothing definite to say. Just do not know.
[22.09.21 18:03:36] basil: But if you really want to get the hang of it, the arduino is not the best choice. I thought you wanted to do embedded systems
[22.09.21 18:04:28] angelo: I don't know what I want to do in life
[22.09.21 18:04:28] angelo: you have to try everything and whatever catches your fancy
[22.09.21 18:04:37] angelo: you want to do what you like
[22.09.21 18:04:56] angelo: embedded systems ?
[22.09.21 18:05:07] angelo: is it the internet of things ? smart home and stuff ?
[22.09.21 18:05:58] basil: Yeah. Well, not desktops, but really small ones. Some are as small as two phalanges. No bigger.
[22.09.21 18:06:22] angelo: You know, like a raspberry or something.
[22.09.21 18:06:33] angelo: I don't even know what they're for
[22.09.21 18:06:38] angelo: at most make a console
[22.09.21 18:06:51] basil: yeah. that's it
[22.09.21 18:07:34] angelo: no, at the moment I'm interested in manipulators, 3D printers, toys, quadrics on the arduino system
[22.09.21 18:07:35] angelo: the kid woke up )
[22.09.21 18:07:46] basil: ok.
[22.09.21 18:07:54] basil: no distractions
[22.09.21 18:08:07] angelo: ok.)

[23.09.21 10:35:53] angelo: working on it
[9/23/221 10:36:02] angelo: 32 is not working for me
[23.09.21 10:36:11] angelo: let me check
[9/23/221 10:36:13] angelo: tell me
[9/23/221 10:36:16] angelo: 10-15 minutes
[9/23/221 10:36:25] angelo: reset the system
[9/23/221 10:36:31] basil: ok. waiting
[9/23/221 11:03:38] basil: can i run tricks on my virtual machine? How about this?
[9/23/221 11:04:06] angelo: yes
[9/23/221 11:04:08] angelo: let's do this
[9/23/221 11:04:14] angelo: it doesn't work
[9/23/221 11:04:21] angelo: both new office and new windup
