[14.09.21 11:54:03] basil: Test
[14.09.21 11:54:06] basil: hello
[14.09.21 11:54:30] rocco: again
[14.09.21 11:55:03] basil: there's no encryption from your side
[14.09.21 11:55:14] basil: So what?
[14.09.21 11:55:18] basil: That's better
[14.09.21 11:55:34] rocco: don't turn on ec2
[14.09.21 11:55:49] basil: you prefer otp&
[14.09.21 11:55:51] basil: ?
[14.09.21 11:56:10] basil: okay.
[14.09.21 11:56:34] rocco: lf us2 yt hf,jnftnm njkrjv
[14.09.21 11:56:42] rocco: ec2 doesn't work properly
[14.09.21 11:56:50] basil: okay
[14.09.21 11:56:55] basil: whatever you say
[14.09.21 11:58:35] basil: What's the problem here. Need spacers and ip control server for spam bot, as for elroy did.
[14.09.21 11:58:53] basil: The customer is going to test
[14.09.21 11:59:58] rocco: I did?
[14.09.21 12:00:09] rocco: I don't remember just
[14.09.21 12:00:11] basil: i think so
[14.09.21 12:03:37] basil: my mistake. That's for another employee. pardon me.
[9/15/21 11:15:54] basil: hello
[17.09.21 13:33:52] basil: hello
[17.09.21 13:34:01] rocco: hi
[17.09.21 13:35:15] basil: talked to demetrius. He kind of said that you were doing ip - pads after all. So which one of you?
[17.09.21 13:35:43] rocco: I do the pads, and he does
[17.09.21 13:35:58] rocco: you want me to do the pads?
[17.09.21 13:36:09] basil: no. that's the point.
[17.09.21 13:36:48] basil: Basically the customer said that in the second half of next week it should be done. But I wish it were sooner.
[17.09.21 13:37:09] rocco: I see
[17.09.21 13:37:40] basil: And he also needs to raise the server. About the server to whom?
[17.09.21 13:38:48] rocco: What kind of customer is he?
[17.09.21 13:39:08] basil: spam bot customer
[17.09.21 13:41:31] rocco: What kind of server does he need, just a server with linux or with some software?
[17.09.21 13:43:13] basil: The server that takes the registration from the spam bot and then sends him the letter data, attachments, and so on. Are there different spacers?
[17.09.21 13:45:01] rocco: I mean, what port will translate
[17.09.21 13:45:19] rocco: and we used to
[17.09.21 13:45:22] rocco: ?
[17.09.21 13:45:32] basil: http https
[17.09.21 13:45:56] rocco: got it, we will
[17.09.21 13:46:08] basil: well, we did. I was testing the bot with the server
[17.09.21 13:47:33] basil: I have a request. Do please make this case and forget it.
[17.09.21 13:49:50] rocco: Yes, I will, on the server what to set up, what to put, or cheat?
[17.09.21 13:51:02] basil: I think that with the server is still better to ask martin. He wrote a master server
[17.09.21 13:51:24] basil: I think he knows exactly what should be there
[17.09.21 14:21:24] rocco: the connection is laggy
[17.09.21 14:21:32] rocco: I mean the server
[17.09.21 14:21:46] basil: it happens...
[17.09.21 14:21:52] rocco: do you need any software or just a clean server?
[17.09.21 14:21:53] basil: what to do
[17.09.21 14:22:15] basil: i'll text martin now.
[17.09.21 14:24:16] basil: let's do this. He'll answer now, I'll text you again. Because I don't really know if it's apache, kafka or something else.
[17.09.21 14:24:29] basil: I can't say for sure
[17.09.21 14:25:02] rocco: yeah
[20.09.21 09:32:31] basil: test

[03.02.22 08:03:37] basil: is it working?
[03.02.22 08:03:45] rocco: now the cipher
[03.02.22 08:03:54] rocco: e2e
