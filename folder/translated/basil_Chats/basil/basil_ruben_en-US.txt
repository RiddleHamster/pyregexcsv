[29.11.21 12:43:09] basil: Hello
[29.11.21 12:43:17] basil: Test
[29.11.21 13:03:58] ruben: hi
[29.11.21 13:04:25] basil: accept OTR
[29.11.21 13:05:10] basil: Can I set up another VPN. Jelly U.S.
[29.11.21 13:05:17] basil: Preferably
[29.11.21 13:05:29] ruben: double?
[29.11.21 13:05:47] ruben: at the office's expense?
[29.11.21 13:06:28] basil: Double how? I just do not know.
[29.11.21 13:06:38] ruben: And uranus is not needed then?
[29.11.21 13:06:51] basil: uranus is needed
[29.11.21 13:07:03] ruben: uranus double
[29.11.21 13:07:18] ruben: which one should it be?
[29.11.21 13:08:52] basil: well with a different address. I wanted to use it "second" on a different virtual machine. That the software would be, so to speak, only the states. I have a suspicion that if you download from cis IP, it will be a bit different
[29.11.21 13:09:23] basil: OS is English and the software is the same. IDE there and so on.
[29.11.21 13:09:35] ruben: do you need double or normal?
[29.11.21 13:09:44] basil: if problematic just tell me. I won't be buzzing your ear.
[29.11.21 13:09:50] ruben: at the office's expense?
[29.11.21 13:10:07] basil: Can it be on the office's account?
[29.11.21 13:10:34] ruben: I don't know, there are people who pay by themselves
[29.11.21 13:11:05] basil: Okay. Can you enlighten me as to how much this pleasure. And how to do it anonymously
[29.11.21 13:13:08] ruben: probably the price of two vpns if double, and the price of one vpn if single
[29.11.21 13:13:39] basil: I'm asking the amount
[29.11.21 13:14:10]
[29.11.21 13:14:31] ruben: 10-20 bucks
[29.11.21 13:14:50] basil: ok
[29.11.21 13:18:14] basil: One more question
[29.11.21 13:18:50] basil: If I use uranus simultaneously (at the same moment) on 2 virtual machines it will work
[29.11.21 13:18:55] basil: ?
[29.11.21 13:19:57] basil: I don't have fun that way for work
[29.11.21 13:21:01] ruben: it will, of course
[29.11.21 13:21:18] ruben: you can have several clients at once
[29.11.21 13:21:38] basil: Great. Thank you. That's what I'll do.
[29.11.21 13:23:21] ruben: you don't need another VPN?
[29.11.21 13:24:02] basil: if it works in this mode, I think I can handle it anyway
[29.11.21 13:24:11] basil: just very slow of course
[11/29/221 13:24:36] basil: tried to set up a 60gb IDE here. All weekend downloaded.
[29.11.21 13:26:47] ruben: You'll download it through proxy
[29.11.21 13:26:52] ruben: faster
[29.11.21 13:27:10] ruben: what kind of IDE is this for 60gb?
[29.11.21 13:27:26] basil: vs2019
[29.11.21 13:27:31] ruben: awful!
[29.11.21 13:27:40] basil: I haven't fully downloaded it yet)))
[29.11.21 13:28:09] basil: and there's only online installer
[29.11.21 13:28:14] basil: so vpn
[29.11.21 13:28:32] ruben: he's a fucking moron with his IDEs
[29.11.21 13:28:46] basil: what to do...
[29.11.21 13:28:55] ruben: *fucked up
[11/29/221 13:29:14] ruben: so, new vpn is canceled then?
[11/29/221 13:29:53] basil: Yeah. I think I'll stick with it for now. Maybe that's enough. No need to bother my bosses with unnecessary expenditures)))
[29.11.21 13:33:47] ruben: okay, whatever you say.

[03.02.22 08:08:51] basil: uranus
[03.02.22 08:09:33] ruben: I'll turn it on
[03.02.22 08:09:50] ruben: here we have revision of services - which ones you need and which ones you don't
[03.02.22 08:10:24] ruben: we will shut down some VPNs and wait, if somebody will sound the alarm or not
[03.02.22 08:10:36] ruben: you only have uranus?
[03.02.22 08:10:39] basil: k. I had it yesterday too
[03.02.22 08:10:49] basil: for now yes
[03.02.22 08:10:55] ruben: I cut it off the night before yesterday
[03.02.22 08:11:03] ruben: I'll put it back
[03.02.22 08:11:14] basil: okay.
[03.02.22 08:11:15] basil: waiting
[03.02.22 08:18:04] ruben: turned it on - check it
