2020-07-24T09:06:00 fast -> stern
I actually here's the question.
I have a somewhat strained relationship with buza. This is expressed in the following.
 On one hand he's certainly right that I'm not good enough in writing code for my project (I was told my level is junior). Little knowledge of the techniques of working with version control system git. Especially with the GitLab remote repository. I've certainly worked with git, but with the local version and worked with it the way I feel comfortable with it. These are objective comments-claims, and it's hard to argue with them.

On the other hand, if he tells me that the code is not written correctly, I guess I have to justify my position somehow. Why and why. And how, actually, from his point of view, it will be right. If I provide some counterarguments (on technical issues), they somehow go unheeded and unanswered. In most cases, "do as I say"! And that's it. I suggested using automated tools to check the quality of code like checkStyle. I was told "we're not that idealistic". Some occasional caustic remarks, in my opinion not quite appropriate.

This leads to the fact that I simply begin to avoid him and "fear" to interact with him. The desire to do something dramatically decreases. That is, deadlines are delayed, which is not good for the organization.
Separately I would like to note that a small project, which I am doing now passes the smoke test and build with string obfuscation. That is, it works.

From my point of view, the situation looks like this.

Now I have questions for the management. Do I suit the organization in terms of my level of knowledge? Does management want me to work there? If so, I would like to ask for some kind of influence over my current supervisor or maybe assign me to another employee. If, again, the organization needs me. In short, I need to defuse situations somehow.

P.S.
Don't think that I'm, like, "all gentle," and immediately run to complain to my mom. But somehow love doesn't really add up, at the moment. I don't ask to kiss my ass. But, you know, it's a lot of fun to get sloped on from time to time.
Please don't misunderstand me.

Thank you for your interest . So far, so good. Tasks given buza (apparently before vacation or some kind of departure) I did. All works, at least the smoke test passes. As he looks at the implementation will see how it returns.

Today I also had a chat with elon. It turned out that we apparently have different versions of the compilers. What he builds, I crash. In general, the first phase seems to be closed. On the second stage made the creation of letters, they remain in the storage outlook.

2020-09-04T12:48:11 fast -> stern
there is code that launches outlook and then hides it

2020-09-04T12:49:19 fast -> stern
I can see outlook in the processes. But at the moment, e-mails from it have stopped being sent for some reason.

2020-09-04T12:50:13 fast -> stern
Discussed this with elon. Concluded that it is necessary to change somehow Outlook settings via API

2020-09-04T12:50:48 fast -> stern
If it works, we will close the second stage.

2020-09-04T12:54:57 fast -> stern

As for the fee. So that no one would think that I had embezzled too much... Last time I was told to create a payment for half of August as well. I got a little confused. I didn't create it for 4 weeks, but for 3. I added it today. If I was mistaken, I would certainly agree to refund it or cut off the next transfer. Please understand, I didn't have any ulterior motives.

2020-09-04T13:00:15 fast -> stern
In general, elon is very nice and convenient to work with. It is possible to discuss some technical questions. With buzz is a bit more complicated. He probably has several "meetings" going on in parallel. Apparently just physically can not - does not have time.  With bonen we also discuss some things, but he somehow prefers to do it himself, maybe it is more convenient for him.

2020-09-04T13:01:21 fast -> stern
So far, so good. If something else interests or you need to keep your hand on the pulse, I'm ready to tell you and discuss
