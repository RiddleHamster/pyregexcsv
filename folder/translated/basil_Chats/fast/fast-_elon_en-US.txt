Greetings. Need to chat about the project. Buza was probably talking about me.

2020-08-17T13:27:16 fast -> elon
Good afternoon. Buza told me about you too. Let me know when you are online. And how can we communicate on you, you, or something else.

2020-08-17T13:28:40 elon -> fast
I'm usually Monday through Friday from 10.xx to 18.xx. You can speak as you like (it's not a matter of principle).

2020-08-17T13:30:34 elon -> fast
I got the TK from Buza. Said that there were some difficulties with the stage, I need help.
Write what does not work, and I need the code.

2020-08-17T13:31:07 fast -> elon
Okay. I got it. I am also from 10.00 to 18.00 usually periodically at this time online.

2020-08-17T13:31:25 fast -> elon
I will now try to add it to the repository

2020-08-17T13:31:46 fast -> elon
I'll let you know as soon as I do it.

2020-08-17T13:31:51 elon -> fast
Okay

At this point, the MAPI work is, in my opinion, close to completion. The code
is functional, string literals are obfuscated, error logging is working.
The development (working with MAPI) is in
branch.https://n4iaacb37wmqclht.onion/fast/graber/tree/branch_for_fixing_errors_in_MA

2020-08-17T14:11:30 fast -> elon
I suggest that we somehow discuss this project and which may arise

2020-08-17T14:11:52 fast -> elon
 questions that may arise

2020-08-17T14:12:56 elon -> fast
I will start a "private conversation", is the OTR plugin enabled ?

2020-08-17T14:13:39 fast -> elon
let me double-check.

2020-08-17T14:14:59 fast -> elon
off-the-Record Message Plugin?

2020-08-17T14:15:08 elon -> fast
Yes

2020-08-17T14:15:20 fast -> elon

hello

2020-08-20T16:52:06 elon -> fast
I've been thinking about the architecture and put a skeleton on it. Here, I'm thinking from where to get a branch to put the files there

2020-08-20T16:52:54 fast -> elon
If you're asking my permission, it's for nothing. As it will be more convenient.

2020-08-20T16:53:09 fast -> elon
Or let's call it

2020-08-20T16:53:13 fast -> elon
skeleton

2020-08-20T16:53:47 elon -> fast
More like recommendations... where is the working fresh code in there?)

2020-08-20T16:55:40 fast -> elon
I seem to have obfuscation working today

2020-08-20T16:55:51 fast -> elon
I'm prostituting it.

2020-08-20T16:55:56 fast -> elon
if it's ok

2020-08-20T16:56:04 fast -> elon
I'm uploading to this thread

2020-08-20T16:56:24 fast -> elon
But buza said

2020-08-20T16:56:35 fast -> elon
what to dump the code into develop\

2020-08-20T16:56:52 fast -> elon
Probably best to go there then.

2020-08-20T16:57:04 elon -> fast
In the wizard working option?

2020-08-20T16:57:21 fast -> elon
no

2020-08-20T16:57:45 fast -> elon
the last merge was to work with stun

2020-08-20T16:58:17 fast -> elon
I personally work in the branch_for_fixing_errors_in_mapi branch

2020-08-20T16:58:23 elon -> fast

here's maybe then to merge it with the master

2020-08-20T17:00:59 fast -> elon
buza said not to pour into the master, only to develop

2020-08-20T17:01:06 fast -> elon
Well, that's what he said.

2020-08-20T17:01:27 fast -> elon
I don't think you can argue with your superiors.

2020-08-20T17:01:36 fast -> elon
I think so

2020-08-20T17:02:15 elon -> fast
there's no arguing...

2020-08-20T17:05:27 elon -> fast
Okay, we'll think about it. See you tomorrow)

2020-08-20T17:06:29 fast -> elon
we can discuss a very interesting question, purely technical

2020-08-20T17:06:40 fast -> elon
take a few minutes

2020-08-20T17:06:41 elon -> fast
Go to

2020-08-20T17:06:53 elon -> fast
Yes

2020-08-20T17:07:08 fast -> elon
I read the developer's manual

2020-08-20T17:07:18 fast -> elon
here's

2020-08-20T17:07:39 fast -> elon
we have std::string in our project

2020-08-20T17:07:45 fast -> elon
is used

2020-08-20T17:08:12 fast -> elon
there's sure to be something like malloc

2020-08-20T17:08:21 fast -> elon
even more likely to be so

2020-08-20T17:08:51 fast -> elon
it is written in the manual that malloc should be avoided

2020-08-20T17:09:23 fast -> elon
How can I rewrite the code so that malloc is not called in the binary

2020-08-20T17:09:27 fast -> elon
?

2020-08-20T17:11:03 elon -> fast
you can:
1) get rid of string, replace it with its implementation (class)
2) just use char* and functions to work with it
3) look for ways to redefine allocators

2020-08-20T17:12:03 elon -> fast
Actually, the string is generally easy to replace, the more difficult problem is the map, set....

2020-08-20T17:12:16 elon -> fast
But allocators are also supposed to be replaced there

2020-08-20T17:12:55 elon -> fast
My experience with the standard library is very small, I rarely work with it

2020-08-20T17:13:25 elon -> fast
Basically either their own implementation, or their own implementation + api

2020-08-20T17:14:02 fast -> elon
Okay, thanks. I'll look up how these allocators are replaced

2020-08-20T17:15:10 elon -> fast
The instructions seem to say to avoid STL, but the standard library seems to be written using templates and the same STL.

2020-08-20T17:18:14 fast -> elon
Well that makes two mutually exclusive paragraphs

2020-08-20T17:18:50 elon -> fast
In this exe file will work. Here I had a previous project, where I had to abandon the standard library in the properties of the project, there it was caused by the need for the library after it is placed in memory is not from disk and not the standard loader libraries. In this aspect, the standard library simply does not work, i.e. the code written using it does not work and can be a lot of surprises. In this project, there seems to be no such requirement. I can't say unequivocally that this code must be gotten rid of, there is no such requirement)

2020-08-20T17:19:54 fast -> elon
ok . Thanks anyway. I suggest that tomorrow we discuss the skeleton in more detail. Can we?

2020-08-20T17:20:40 elon -> fast
I'll post it or I'll discount it0, it's all commented and there's a lot to discuss.

2020-08-20T17:21:13 fast -> elon
ok. thank you.

2020-08-20T17:21:24 elon -> fast

No, unfortunately, it's still the same.
