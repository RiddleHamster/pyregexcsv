There buza sent me the last version of the spam bot. Do you have it?

2020-08-21T07:56:19 bonen -> fast
No

2020-08-21T07:56:31 bonen -> fast
It would be nice to get.

2020-08-21T07:58:09 fast -> bonen
If I send it to you... Is that even possible? Or maybe just the DNS stuff? As a more experienced employee, tell me.

2020-08-21T07:59:11 bonen -> fast
Send the whole thing. I'll take a look at it just in time.

2020-08-21T08:00:11 fast -> bonen
Just so no one has problems with the management afterwards

2020-08-21T08:00:33 bonen -> fast
Then the DNS part is better

2020-08-21T08:00:54 fast -> bonen
ok

2020-08-21T08:01:07 fast -> bonen
I'll make a link in a minute.

I have a question. I'm adding stun obfuscation now, should I do this task in a separate branch, or can I add commits in the same branch I'm working in now

2020-08-27T08:07:05:05 bonen -> fast
Make a branch from a branch.

2020-08-27T08:07:15 fast -> bonen

Hi. No. headers are the response headers. The thing is that there are a) MIME type b) Filename. They are separated by "\r\n"
