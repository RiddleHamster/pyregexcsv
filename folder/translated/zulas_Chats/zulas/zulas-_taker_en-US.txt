2020-11-02T07:29:57 zulas -> taker
I don't get it.

2020-11-02T11:23:20 zulas -> taker
I don't get it.

2020-11-02T14:17:28 zulas -> taker
write it without an apr.

2020-11-02T14:56:55 zulas -> taker
write it without an apr.

2020-11-03T15:00:07 zulas -> taker
What the hell is going on?)

2020-11-03T15:00:10 zulas -> taker
are you there ?

2020-11-03T15:04:14 taker -> zulas
ntcn

2020-11-03T15:04:15 taker -> zulas
test

2020-11-03T15:05:29 zulas -> taker
test passed

2020-11-03T15:05:33 taker -> zulas
yeee

2020-11-03T15:05:38 taker -> zulas
OTR is not friends with you at all

2020-11-03T15:05:45 zulas -> taker
I don't have it installed.

2020-11-03T15:05:48 taker -> zulas
Ð°

2020-11-03T15:05:50 zulas -> taker
nailed it.

2020-11-03T15:05:52 taker -> zulas
well

2020-11-03T15:06:05 taker -> zulas
Are you already in the new chat room or not yet?

2020-11-03T15:06:15 taker -> zulas
def just started transferring there

2020-11-03T15:06:15 zulas -> taker
What's the new one? It's the only one I know.

2020-11-03T15:06:27 zulas -> taker
He didn't write me anything.

2020-11-03T15:06:28 taker -> zulas
I guess you haven't gotten to it yet.

2020-11-03T15:06:33 taker -> zulas
well just started

2020-11-03T15:06:40 zulas -> taker
so what's your question to me?

2020-11-03T15:06:41 taker -> zulas
What did you want to ask

2020-11-03T15:06:52 taker -> zulas
on the erlang if the epmd hangs on 0.0.0.0

2020-11-03T15:07:04 taker -> zulas
then anyone can connect to the console, right?

2020-11-03T15:07:13 taker -> zulas
Knowing yerlang cookies

2020-11-03T15:07:44 zulas -> taker
no . epmd it only manages the node names and ports between the erlang nodes which are on a given machine .

2020-11-03T15:08:01 zulas -> taker
i.e. you start one erlang a@domain
and then a second b@domain

2020-11-03T15:08:38 zulas -> taker
all of them both went to epmd and requested the names of other nodes (or rather ports) on which they listen .

2020-11-03T15:08:50 zulas -> taker
And now they can connect with each other in spontaneous fashion.

2020-11-03T15:08:52 zulas -> taker
But here's a but

2020-11-03T15:09:11 zulas -> taker
2 nodes can connect only when they have the same cookies ... i.e. some password .

2020-11-03T15:09:26 zulas -> taker
you can run one erlang node with one cookie .

2020-11-03T15:09:26 taker -> zulas
hmm

2020-11-03T15:09:32 zulas -> taker
and the other node with the other .

2020-11-03T15:09:34 taker -> zulas
Well, here's a cadmin, for example.

2020-11-03T15:09:37 zulas -> taker
And they won't be able to connect

2020-11-03-03T15:09:43 taker -> zulas
tcp 0 0.0.0.0:4369 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 13958/epmd

2020-11-03T15:09:54 zulas -> taker
the console part -- that's launching one node ... and connecting it to another

2020-11-03T15:09:58 taker -> zulas
anyone can ask what ports the nodes have

2020-11-03-03T15:10:23 taker -> zulas
tcp 0 0.0.0.0:40777 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 30066/beam.smp
tcp 0 0.0.0.0:4369 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 13958/epmd
tcp 0 0.0.0.0:8083 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 30066/beam.smp
tcp 0 0 0 127.0.0.1:5432 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 2656/postgres
tcp 0 0.0.0.0:8090 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 30066/beam.smp

2020-11-03T15:10:35 taker -> zulas
But aren't the bins also on 0.0.0.0?

2020-11-03T15:10:55 taker -> zulas
it's kind of a big deal because without cookies no one will get in?

2020-11-03T15:11:33 zulas -> taker
so if you set a different cookie ... you can not connect by default

2020-11-03T15:11:48 zulas -> taker
Well, by default, the cookies used are those that are in the system.

2020-11-03T15:11:53 zulas -> taker
Well, yes ...

2020-11-03T15:12:05 zulas -> taker
Close port 4369 from the outside.

2020-11-03T15:12:21 zulas -> taker
Better yet, leave the ports you need

2020-11-03T15:12:24 zulas -> taker
I don't understand what the question is.

2020-11-03T15:12:42 taker -> zulas
Yes, just to be safe, I want to understand how it works

2020-11-03T15:12:54 taker -> zulas
i.e. if someone has a cacu they can log in to the server

2020-11-03T15:12:56 taker -> zulas
If not, then no

2020-11-03T15:13:06 taker -> zulas
yerlang is black magic for me :D

2020-11-03T15:13:54 zulas -> taker
not to the server ... but to connect to a remote erlang console . and do something inside .

2020-11-03T15:14:07 zulas -> taker
But in general, the console can be left unattended ... only nothing can be done from the inside

2020-11-03T15:14:45 taker -> zulas
The console is manual.

2020-11-03T15:14:58 zulas -> taker
I mean the console inside the erlang ...

2020-11-03T15:15:01 taker -> zulas
If you throw the files into .ssh, you can root

2020-11-03T15:15:02 zulas -> taker
Which one do you mean?

2020-11-03T15:15:07 taker -> zulas
Yeah, you can run any code there, right?

2020-11-03T15:15:14 taker -> zulas
i.e. I can open the file to disks to write

2020-11-03T15:15:18 zulas -> taker
Yes . if you go inside . then yes .

2020-11-03T15:15:37 taker -> zulas
I got it, better close the ports then

2020-11-03T15:16:03 zulas -> taker
open the ports that you need. everything else is closed. in my opinion this should be the default for True admins)

2020-11-03T15:16:29 taker -> zulas
verily so )

2020-11-03T15:19:20 taker -> zulas
thank you!

2020-11-03T15:19:43 zulas -> taker
you're welcome )

2020-11-03T15:19:51 zulas -> taker
If you need anything, ask for it.

2020-11-03T15:20:06 taker -> zulas
necessarily)
