[14.09.21 11:56:31] Garfield: hi
[14.09.21 11:56:48] Garfield: hammer sent to you with tinjectDll
[14.09.21 11:57:04] Garfield: start a command through the admin panel or something like that
[14.09.21 11:59:35] jaime: Hi. Yes thanks.
[14.09.21 11:59:54] jaime: I'm going to make a mess and ask you to restart the module.
[14.09.21 12:00:43] Garfield: ok, only on which bot will you send the log of it in the "black" admin
[14.09.21 12:01:16] Garfield: I just do not have that information) where exactly
[14.09.21 12:01:19] jaime: I can probably only IP
[14.09.21 12:01:26] Garfield: okay
[14.09.21 13:52:10] jaime: Robin gave me IP 72.203.252.87, there are also parameters for vnc. That's where to unload injectDLL and upload tinjectDLL.
[14.09.21 13:52:32] jaime: Date of build should be today in admin panel :)
[14.09.21 13:53:39] Garfield: sec
[14.09.21 13:57:07] Garfield: something i do not quite understand. i.e. you need to replace the module in the admin panel or what? from this ip in the admin panel i see bots
[14.09.21 13:58:54] Garfield: I can only send a command to the bot, what exactly Angelo did not even know))
[14.09.21 13:59:24] jaime: you should run injectDLL, unload it, and load tinjectDLL :)
[14.09.21 13:59:44] Garfield: I suspect, that it's done not in that admin panel, which I have access to
[14.09.21 13:59:48] jaime: I don't know how, I've never done it. :)
[14.09.21 14:00:01] jaime: I have no access at all :)
[14.09.21 14:00:18] Garfield: )) I'll knock on Hammehe, maybe he'll clarify it
[14.09.21 14:00:22] Garfield: to Hammer
[14.09.21 14:00:24] Garfield: *
[14.09.21 14:00:50] jaime: I'll bother Angelo :)
[14.09.21 14:01:03] Garfield: ok)
[14.09.21 15:14:25] jaime: MAGALLEYSTATION_W617601.DBD0F33BA3D5F0B77B30D937EBBF85D1 and if so?
[14.09.21 15:14:39] Garfield: repeat please
[14.09.21 15:15:40] Garfield: I messed with angel, he can not figure something out himself, all bots are active on this ip - I was initially confused by this, it is not clear what kind of test bot you have
[14.09.21 15:16:07] jaime: MAGALLEYSTATION_W617601.DBD0F33BA3D5F0B77B30D937EBBF85D1 and if so?
[14.09.21 15:16:32] jaime: And there's 68.184.58.4
[14.09.21 15:17:30] Garfield: Yeah, there's one today's ip
[14.09.21 15:18:03] Garfield: I'll send him commands
[14.09.21 15:19:47] Garfield: I'll knock when they're gone. 3-5 minutes
[14.09.21 15:20:03] jaime: yeah thanks :)
[14.09.21 15:22:52] Garfield: all gone
[14.09.21 15:32:55] jaime: MAGALLEYSTATION_W617601.DBD0F33BA3D5F0B77B30D937EBBF85D1 and it worked here?
[14.09.21 15:35:03] Garfield: a minute, I'll give it there too, sorry
[14.09.21 15:35:59] jaime: It's ok. :) extra check would not hurt.
[14.09.21 15:37:57] Garfield: commands given, a couple of minutes, as implemented)
[14.09.21 15:42:06] Garfield: started tinjectDll, well, everything seems to be okay, went into the executed, the module should run

[14.09.21 16:18:02] Garfield: done)
[14.09.21 18:39:15] jaime: If in place. Can you make another one?

ðŸ™‚
[14.09.21 19:40:37] jaime: 67.141.71.39
[14.09.21 19:40:57] garfield: yes now
[14.09.21 19:41:25] jaime: thanks. :)
[14.09.21 19:42:41] Garfield: there is one, just a minute)
[14.09.21 19:46:14] Garfield: gave commands, 3-5 minutes to check)
[14.09.21 19:47:14] Garfield: I'm still here till 12, if there's anything, just write
[14.09.21 19:49:07] jaime: Great. We have to stop. Seems to be working. Tomorrow we'll reload on all of them let him look.
[14.09.21 19:53:02] Garfield: Okay. Productive day - it's good) in touch)
[14.09.21 20:01:20] jaime: So Robin's on a roll today too, another IP as soon as possible 108.50.129.95
[14.09.21 20:01:29] jaime: Sorry to interrupt.
[14.09.21 20:01:43] Garfield: It's okay.
[14.09.21 20:03:55] Garfield: there bot last activity 25min ago, gave the command to unload the module, I'll see if it bounces or not
[14.09.21 20:09:05] jaime: Yeah, looks like it's already offiline
[14.09.21 20:10:25] Garfield: yes it seems, if you have someone else test - skype how to find)
[14.09.21 20:19:01] jaime: ok :) i would go for a beer and sleep :)
[14.09.21 20:26:04] Garfield: yes yes, the topic is normal)) still would learn to make their own home Kraft - that would be a beauty))) equipment is available to anyone so)
[14.09.21 20:29:19] jaime: I once had a friend who treated me to some IP. It's strong, but it doesn't really look like beer.  More like kvass (stout) maybe.
[14.09.21 20:29:50] jaime: I would take it, but there is a lot to brew, and I always like different things. :) what's 20 liters :)
[14.09.21 20:36:50] Garfield: yes, this is also a nuance, there are a couple of three liters roughly will not work, and unpasteurized do not keep for a long time. more fun somewhere in the summer at the cottage with the company)))
[14.09.21 20:37:26] Garfield: on a forum I've seen breweries selling their own breweries, who does what :laughing:
[14.09.21 20:39:41] jaime: you'll brew something, but it won't go and then choke on it. :) It's a pity to pour it out
[14.09.21 20:43:44] Garfield: Anything can happen)) the fantasy of a lover of beer is good.) What else is expected at work, or are we braking for today?
[14.09.21 20:45:54] Garfield: Last bot online
[14.09.21 20:45:56] Garfield: sec
[14.09.21 20:46:26] Garfield: command
[14.09.21 20:48:54] Garfield: tinjectDll test module is loaded, you can check it
[14.09.21 20:53:22] jaime: Oh great! Let's have a look at the last one!
[14.09.21 20:55:05] Garfield: okay.)
[14.09.21 20:57:34] jaime: I'm ok, thanks :)
[14.09.21 20:57:51] Garfield: ok, connect!)
[14.09.21 20:58:03] jaime: Go to sleep now :)
[14.09.21 20:59:54] jaime: good night. See you tomorrow.
[14.09.21 21 21:00:15] Garfield: yeah. see you tomorrow.
[15.09.21 01:35:27] Garfield: let's get some more in case this one doesn't come back anytime soon
[15.09.21 01:35:27] Garfield: maybe one more in case he doesn't come back soon
[9/15/221 07:25:05] jaime: Hi.
[15.09.21 07:25:20] jaime: what was that last one again? :)
[15.09.21 08:49:59] Garfield: Hi.
[15.09.21 08:50:05] Garfield: Last bot off
[15.09.21 08:55:58] jaime: And we checked everything yesterday. Today already in the battle module passed
[15.09.21 08:56:40] Garfield: I got it, I thought I'd have to do it again with the last one)
[15.09.21 19:49:30] jaime: Hi.
[15.09.21 19:49:42] jaime: And can you reset module like yesterday?
[15.09.21 19:49:51] garfield: hi
[15.09.21 19:49:53] Garfield: Okay.
[15.09.21 19:49:55] jaime: 50.84.242.190 right here.
[15.09.21 19:50:05] jaime: inject only
[15.09.21 19:50:14] jaime: Not tinject
[15.09.21 19:50:20] Garfield: Got it
[15.09.21 19:51:29] Garfield: I'll report back in 3-5 minutes
[15.09.21 19:58:28] Garfield: Done
[15.09.21 20:01:07] jaime: thanks. :)
[15.09.21 20:01:27] Garfield: welcome)
[16.09.21 12:44:55] Garfield: Hi. Damn, almost gave me a false alarm) thought bot stopped knocking after injectDll
[16.09.21 12:45:16] Garfield: there was just a glitch, for 17 minutes the knockout stopped
[16.09.21 12:45:54] Garfield: Just started describing the bug, and then it showed up))
[16.09.21 12:48:43] jaime: Hi!
[16.09.21 12:48:57] jaime: I couldn't connect via vnc at some point yesterday
[16.09.21 12:49:17] jaime: Thought everything was off, then it worked
[16.09.21 12:49:31] Garfield: I think I had something similar
[16.09.21 12:51:16] Garfield: the main thing is that nothing crashes) and you can wait sometimes, since it happens, I will keep in mind
[16.09.21 13:11:39] Garfield: it was just a glitch, 2 other bots all ok after inject
[16.09.21 13:14:32] jaime: I actually thought they shut down the computer. They saw that something was wrong and turned it off :)
[16.09.21 13:21:33] Garfield: everything is fine, def even with the cloud on - it's good)) I think in processes look a few users, all the movement there :laughing:
