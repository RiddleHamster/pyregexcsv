[23.09.21 08:38:01] jaime: Hi.
[23.09.21 08:38:28] jaime: If anything yesterday DESKTOP-QH819UE_W10019042.D3B2BDBCB31BF3134D3F8F33B3B551F3 from here
[23.09.21 12:17:55] jaime: can you see if there is anything from 0734FBBC5BBFD5BD3A7EF3F5D3F433B1 ?
[23.09.21 12:20:40] thomas: hi.
[23.09.21 12:20:56] jaime: hi!
[27.09.21 08:26:58] jaime: hi.
[27.09.21 08:27:03] jaime: Busy?
[27.09.21 09:21:22] thomas: hi.
[27.09.21 09:21:26] thomas: Working.
[27.09.21 09:27:00] jaime: You need some data?
[27.09.21 09:27:18] jaime: I can just quietly send from the booth
[27.09.21 11:31:47] thomas: you mean stylac?
[27.09.21 11:54:05] jaime: I've got a simple server on flask, and I send data to it from schwab.com and btt.com, I check that there is the data we need.
[27.09.21 11:54:54] jaime: I see that it is not easy to unscramble everything there, if necessary I just try ip and can send this data where needed.
[27.09.21 11:56:15] jaime: Do you need different parsers for each site? I just know what I enter and you can easily understand in what fields this data sit :)
[27.09.21 12:17:32] thomas: I can't tell you that.
[27.09.21 12:17:42] thomas: define the problem better
[27.09.21 13:36:26] jaime: I offered not the problem, but to debug :)
