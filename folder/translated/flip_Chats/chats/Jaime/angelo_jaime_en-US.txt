[27.07.21 12:15:59] angelo: Write @dane
[27.07.21 12:16:10] angelo: our best coder )
[27.07.21 12:16:21] angelo: I warned him a friend will write )))
[27.07.21 12:19:08] angelo: he is a good dude
[25.08.21 13:06:00] angelo: To access the daemon you use HTTP API at
http://127.0.0.1:8081/

Since there is no authorization, it is obligatory to use --local_admin=1, so no one from the Internet can access the API
If you need access from the Internet, it is better to use proxying via nginx (to http://127.0.0.1:8081/) with added authorization (basic or cert).


In case of error JSON is returned
{"status": false, "error": "error information"}

If successful, JSON is returned:
{"status": true, ....}

When requesting logs, if successful, the text of the log is returned immediately (without JSON)

The following queries are supported:

1) Restart the daemon
POST /api/reboot
reboot=1

2) Getting statistics
GET /api/stat/get

3) Cleaning statistics
POST /api/stat/clear
clear=1

4) Getting the config
GET /api/config/get

5) Installing the config
POST /api/config/set
ping=Sec - how often to send ping to the bot
ping_limit=Sec - bot idle timeout (how many seconds to turn it off if there is no data from it). Preferably it should be = ping * 2 + 2
wait_bot=Sec - how long to wait for the connection of the bot after the client
established=Sec - timeout idle session between client and bot.
wait_client=Sec - timeout between client connection and receiving data from it

6) Enable connection logging on socks and vnc
POST /api/log/start
start=1

7) Disable connection logging on socks and vnc
POST /api/log/stop
stop=1

ðŸ˜Ž Get the connection log on socks and vnc (if it was previously enabled)
GET /api/log/get


9) Get the system log (data in it will depend on the value of --loglevel)
GET /api/syslog/get

10) Get the online list
GET /api/online/list

[02.12.21 12:10:04] angelo: You'll have a folder builder, there's a subfolder bat_Stannum in it, make a copy of the last one, the last one was audi.bat, rewind it to the name of the new protec, and edit it
change the lines there
@set PRJ_NAME=Audi where you put the name of your project
@set UPDATE_VER=15 change the value up, you need 16
@set HOST_LIST=upperdown.eu*upperdown.in where you put your domain names
save everything and run the batch file
before that, create a folder in the root of c:\files, there will be ready to build, archive prj_*.zip, check the dllku from there, run
check the build, another batnick, you will have another folder test, I will download too, in this folder copy the build dll, and rename it to bot.dll
and run Run.bat
if everything is fine, in your dashboard will appear your project with your bot's online

[02.12.21 12:11:12] angelo: I'm racking my brain.
[02.12.21 12:12:42] jaime: What's not clear?
[02.12.21 12:13:33] angelo: made a copy of the binary and changed it into Bugati
[02.12.21 12:13:41] angelo: but how to edit a batcher ?
[02.12.21 12:14:02] jaime: put far
[02.12.21 12:14:21] angelo: total will not work ?
[02.12.21 12:14:30] jaime: okay
[02.12.21 12:14:38] angelo: ok
[02.12.21 12:14:53] jaime: F4 on baonic and correct
[02.12.21 12:15:11] angelo: pfft!)
[02.12.21 12:15:12] angelo: got it
[02.12.21 12:15:36] angelo: after running the batch file in c:\files the build crashes
[02.12.21 12:16:04] angelo: before that, create a folder in the root of c:\files, there will be a ready-made build, prj_*.zip archive, check the dllku from there, run

[02.12.21 12:16:15] angelo: i don't understand it
[02.12.21 12:16:53] angelo: do you think i can build on the main car ?
[02.12.21 12:17:44] jaime: you can do
[02.12.21 12:17:48] jaime: but not run
[02.12.21 12:22:13] jaime: does our toad work for you?
[02.12.21 12:22:21] angelo: yes
[02.12.21 12:22:24] angelo: it works.
[02.12.21 12:23:18] jaime: it's weird, tor proxy works, I checked, but no connection
[02.12.21 12:23:34] angelo: not without bugs
[02.12.21 12:23:39] angelo: but toad usually doesn't glitch
[02.12.21 12:24:36] angelo: 1.
2. Fill there the vps_proxy.run script with the following command
scp vps_proxy.run root@ip_vps:/root
3. Go to your VPPS and do 2 commands
cd && chmod +x vps_proxy.run
./vps_proxy.run -- --special-cert --backend=217.12.219.12
[02.12.21 12:24:45] angelo: how do i upload a script ?
[02.12.21 12:24:52] angelo: I have a file
[02.12.21 12:25:01] angelo: Benny is doing it but I want to understand
[02.12.21 12:25:19] jaime: scp is part of the putty package, file transfer via ssh
[02.12.21 12:25:44] jaime: far has a built in module
[02.12.21 12:26:03] angelo: thought it was possible to get in through my Ubuntu
[02.12.21 12:26:07] angelo: don't like putty
[02.12.21 12:26:11] angelo: there's tons of settings
[02.12.21 12:26:19] jaime: you can use Ubuntu
[02.12.21 12:26:25] jaime: there's scp
[02.12.21 12:27:04] angelo: where to put the file itself ?
[02.12.21 12:27:15] angelo: I don't understand it
[02.12.21 12:27:41] angelo: this script from vps_proxy.run description
[02.12.21 12:27:55] jaime: https://success.tanaza.com/s/article/How-to-use-SCP-command-on-Windows
[02.12.21 12:28:13] jaime: is vps_proxy.run this one?
[02.12.21 12:28:20] angelo: yeah
[02.12.21 12:29:18] jaime: scp vps_proxy.run root@ip_vps:/root run in the folder with this script, the command will copy this script to the vps folder root
[02.12.21 12:30:49] jaime: from putty take the file pscp.exe put in the folder of the script and give pscp -scp vps_proxy.run root@ip_vps:/root
[02.12.21 12:32:16] angelo: you have to run in the folder with this script
[02.12.21 12:32:22] angelo: sorry for stupidity my friend
[02.12.21 12:32:49] angelo: i.e. I go to the path where the script is and from there in the terminal run the command ?
[02.12.21 12:33:32] angelo: but how it will work, I'm in a folder on my local machine, not on the VPS
[02.12.21 12:33:33] jaime: yes
[02.12.21 12:33:59] jaime: so you copy the file from your machine to the vpska
[02.12.21 12:34:45] jaime: scp is secure copy
[02.12.21 12:35:03] angelo: ip(here I write ip)_vps:/root
[02.12.21 12:35:17] angelo: yes ?
[02.12.21 12:35:24] angelo: got it
[02.12.21 12:35:26] angelo: i think i got it
[02.12.21 12:35:34] jaime: ip_vps - replace this with ip
[02.12.21 12:35:42] angelo: that's it
[02.12.21 12:35:49] angelo: now I have clarity in my head
[02.12.21 12:35:53] jaime: :)
[02.12.21 12:36:07] angelo: 37.5 ((
[02.12.21 12:36:12] angelo: not too bright as it is
[02.12.21 12:36:19] jaime: not nice.
[02.12.21 12:36:27] jaime: the temperature
[02.12.21 12:36:42] jaime: do it once now and you'll understand
[02.12.21 12:37:00] angelo: i'm like that, all i care is to do something once, no matter what
[02.12.21 12:37:10] angelo: i remember the first time i changed a headlight..... it was horrible
[02.12.21 12:37:14] jaime: it's cool to put msys on the machine, it's basically linux on the windup, all these commands are there
[02.12.21 12:37:27] angelo: or rather a headlight bulb
[02.12.21 12:38:07] angelo: it's still complicated for me
[02.12.21 12:38:11] jaime: I once could not change the bulb, it was too much to remove. :)
[02.12.21 12:38:21] jaime: That's why I advise far
[02.12.21 12:38:45] angelo: yeah, i had a tough car, everything was fucked up
[02.12.21 12:38:55] angelo: i did it on youtube
[02.12.21 12:39:19] angelo: when I do something, it doesn't matter what, then everything goes like clockwork
[02.12.21 12:39:41] jaime: well, it will be so now!  :)
[02.12.21 12:39:52] jaime: I'm going to get some coffee! :)
[02.12.21 12:41:28] angelo: Come on.
[02.12.21 12:41:33] angelo: I gotta eat too
[02.12.21 12:41:37] angelo: somehow
[02.12.21 13:02:42] angelo: did you talk to benny?
[02.12.21 13:14:52] jaime: no, I haven't.
[02.12.21 13:15:16] angelo: I think he's a very mature guy.
[02.12.21 13:15:19] angelo: You and you
[02.12.21 13:15:22] angelo: I'm already embarrassed
[02.12.21 13:15:45] jaime: :) and what are you talking about?
[02.12.21 13:16:03] angelo: well, we are trying to do a task
[02.12.21 13:48:00] angelo: nitrogen, when you get here - let me know! did you get all points starting from point 5?
[02.12.21 13:48:07] angelo: this makes me uncomfortable
[02.12.21 13:49:29] jaime: Why?
[02.12.21 13:50:50] angelo: I don't know, you and you
