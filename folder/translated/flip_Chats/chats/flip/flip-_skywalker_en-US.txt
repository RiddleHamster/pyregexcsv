Hi. Didn't you work with shellcode?

2020-10-07T12:22:09 flip -> skywalker
Hi. Been working for a while. Forgot a little, need to remember. :)

2020-10-07T12:22:49 skywalker -> flip
I'll describe the problem, if you know what to do.

2020-10-07T12:23:19 skywalker -> flip
In a nutshell, I use msfvenom to generate a set of commands, when I save and run as an elf file, everything is ok, when I do through point to array, through console application, there is an error when called for some reason.

I use https://github.com/DimopoulosElias/SimpleShellcodeInjector

2020-10-07T12:23:51 skywalker -> flip
Here is the version for win, I am using the array on linux

2020-10-07T12:25:25 flip -> skywalker
Let me check it out.

2020-10-07T12:26:19 skywalker -> flip
Ok

2020-10-07T12:35:50 flip -> skywalker
1. you created an elf with some code.

2020-10-07T12:36:09 flip -> skywalker
2.  How did you pull the code you stuck in the array?

2020-10-07T12:45:06 flip -> skywalker
https://github.com/UserExistsError/DllLoaderShellcode.git

2020-10-07T12:45:33 flip -> skywalker
This is where it was all step by step.

2020-10-07T12:47:00 flip -> skywalker
The dll loader as a shellcode, the extactor of this shellcode, the test libuha and the actual test for injection.

2020-10-07T12:49:32 skywalker -> flip
1.yes

2020-10-07T12:49:50 skywalker -> flip
2.msfvenom outputs to an array of c

He's not just converting this elf into an array? Maybe he doesn't want an elf, but a bin with a pure text segment?

2020-10-07T12:53:39 flip -> skywalker
Look at the first bytes match the elf header

2020-10-07T13:00:40 flip -> skywalker
There was such a format in dos as com. It was just a piece of code, with relative transitions. Without any headers whatsoever. Here's a shellcode something similar. You need to rip out the right piece of text segment from elf with, objdump and that's what you need to run through the array.

2020-10-07T13:02:02 flip -> skywalker
More precisely objcopy

> He's not just converting this elf into an array? Maybe he doesn't want an elf, but a bin with a pure text segment?
I don't know. Everywhere on the web where I looked purely assembler not bytes were

> Check the first bytes match the elf header
Yes, they do.

> More precisely objcopy
I'll have to see how. I don't remember.

2020-10-07T13:51:25 flip -> skywalker
objcopy --output-format=binary --only-section=.text a.elfcode.bin like this

2020-10-07T13:51:58 skywalker -> flip
Ok. I'll try

2020-10-08T10:00:24 flip -> skywalker
Hi. How was it?

2020-10-08T10:03:37 skywalker -> flip
Hi. How did it work out?

2020-10-08T15:05:45 flip -> skywalker

" [13:00:23] <flip> Hi. How was it?

2020-10-08T15:19:42 skywalker -> flip
Hi

2020-10-08T15:19:51 skywalker -> flip
Something's broken.

2020-10-08T15:20:42 skywalker -> flip
Yes. It worked, only in a very different way.... I couldn't find the text objump section.

2020-10-08T15:21:39 flip -> skywalker
Yeah I see. :)

2020-10-08T15:21:49 flip -> skywalker
How did you do it?

2020-10-08T15:24:35 skywalker -> flip
msfvenom -p windows/messagebox -f exe

2020-10-08T15:25:00 flip -> skywalker
msfvenom - I'm not familiar with it. :)

2020-10-08T15:25:38 skywalker -> flip
Yeah, me too. Part of some big framework for IS testers
