Made two ways to capture information, from different apache filters.

2020-07-30T16:27:32 flip -> stern
Implemented at one site.

2020-07-30T16:28:23 flip -> stern
Buza asked for some features, particularly on data swapping in response packets.

2020-07-30T16:28:32 flip -> stern
Dooms asked.

2020-07-30T16:29:28 flip -> stern
Did a little refactoring, out of a slightly sprawling program. :)

Hi! I did an injection in IIS, the original way. And moved the apache module code to support the logic.

2020-10-10T15:39:15 flip -> stern
Under Windows 2008 my injector didn't work, although under Windows 10 it worked fine. I was dealing with the problem, but did not find a good solution because of services isolation in Windows 2008, and lack of experience on Windows.

2020-10-10T15:39:55 flip -> stern
Busa hooked me up with the WebInject project while I'm sorting out the code.

2020-10-10T15:40:41 flip -> stern
Busa asked me to investigate the possibility of taking a screenshot from under the Windows lock window. Studying.
