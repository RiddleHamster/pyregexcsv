[03.08.21 09:58:13] dane: Hi!
[03.08.21 09:59:21] dane: Can you vic the 32 and 64 shellcodes to test the crypts. I check stubs on test shellcodes in test tab - clear.
[03.08.21 10:00:00] manuel: Hey, buddy! Now.
[03 08.08.21 10:00:11] dane: Thanks!
[03.08.21 10:00:48] manuel: ready!
[03.08.21 10:04:12] dane: +++
[03.08.21 10:31:44] dane: exe_shellcode_64_crypter6 - cleaned
[03 08.08.21 10:31:59] manuel: Perfect!
[03.08.21 10:34:27] manuel: Buddy, can you clean stub for leo loeder?
[03.08.21 10:34:41] manuel: because there's nothing to crypt. the others are dirty too
[03.08.21 10:34:57] manuel: https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/89f278c529e211bdc87ea1c099b05d28
[03.08.21 10:35:01] dane: I checked it this morning, it was clean.) Sure, I'll do it!
[03.08.21 10:35:15] manuel: https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/16d407ea4a9d3add9184719dbf18c1cc
[03.08.21 10:35:32] manuel: bot got encrypted all right, but loader still won't go
[03.08.21 10:35:40] dane: got it
[03.08.21 10:35:57] dane: what to do first, looder or shell32?
[03.08.21 10:37:58] manuel: lowader
[03.08.21 10:38:12] dane: ok
[03.08.21 11:13:18] dane: Cleaning up for now, Dinchek hangs all the time. Do you know why avcek doesn't work?
[03.08.21 11:13:34] manuel: I'll check it out.
[03.08.21 11:15:02] manuel: You can use it. I'm out of tariff.
[03.08.21 11:15:14] dane: Yeah, thanks!
[03.08.21 11:15:29] manuel: I'll do a per-file pay per-check and then I'll add more money and set a normal fare.
[03.08.21 11:15:55] dane: ok!
[03.08.21 11:50:05] dane: try looper crypto
[03.08.21 11:51:38] manuel: doing
[03.08.21 12:19:53] manuel: https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/cfd8ea96e9f48f2e6058f38d5a714efa like this
[03.08.21 12:20:10] manuel: there's no stubs there. Are you uploading again?
[03.08.21 12:24:26] dane: Stubs are there, I checked.
[03.08.21 12:24:42] dane: What kind of detective is this?
[03.08.21 12:24:50] manuel: I must have glitched something.
[03.08.21 12:26:12] dane: I tested the loeder 20 minutes ago - it was clean
[03.08.21 12:26:49] manuel: I'll re-crypt it again.
[03.08.21 12:28:59] dane: Another thing. You can crypt the looder with the bot's cryptor. And vice versa. I clean them separately, but they are the same in functionality. That's right, keep in mind )))
[03.08.21 12:29:46] manuel: wow! Okay.
[03.08.21 12:30:59] dane: Now I made one more crypto loader - clean.
[03.08.21 12:32:35] manuel: I just uploaded you fresh looder and bot leo
[03.08.21 12:33:17] dane: I just wanted to ask you about it!!! )))
[03.08.21 12:33:45] manuel: I feel!)
[03.08.21 12:34:47] dane: I'm leaving, if something goes wrong still today, write to the toad. I always check and clean Leo's stubs in the morning. Checked today too.

lowder https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/c2ecb0090d8f928b6f435fbea1189e30
[18.08.21 08:44:00] manuel: yeah...
[18.08.21 09:06:03] dane: Try crypting rundll_crypter6. It might work. Cleanup seems to be a long time coming.
[18.08.21 09:06:24] manuel: Yeah, I'll try.
[18.08.21 09:06:35] manuel: At least 1 stub, of course...

[18.08.21 09:06:51] manuel: Just all other stubs are dirty too...
[18.08.21 09:28:20] dane: dll_leo-bot_crypter6 cleaned, tried crypt in panel - clean. Try it.
Right now I'm cleaning loader.
[18.08.21 09:30:54] manuel: Yep now
[08/18/21 09:36:34] manuel: Okay. The bot is clean. Try the lowder.
[18.08.21 09:36:48] dane: Nothing yet...
[18.08.21 09:37:16] manuel: you can't use this stub to do a looder?
[18.08.21 09:37:56] dane: it doesn't work. Try rundll 6 loeder to crypt.
[18.08.21 09:38:13] manuel: ok.
[18.08.21 09:39:49] dane: on my machine looder is crypted via rundll, clean.
[18.08.21 09:40:46] manuel: and what parameters to add to rundll ?  entry point
[18.08.21 09:42:57] dane: leave it blank

[18.08.21 11:58:59] manuel: maybe file is new?
[18.08.21 12:00:03] dane: no, I didn't clean it every day before, but yesterday and today I had to
[18.08.21 12:01:59] manuel: it was on for almost a week
[18.08.21 12:02:38] dane: yeah
[19.08.21 08:34:01] dane: Hi! ))If a detection will appear on Leo, try to collect a pack, one by three, maybe it will get out...
[19.08.21 08:35:37] manuel: Hi. Good )
[20.08.21 09:22:34] dane: Hi! )))
I have detects on Leo's stubs. Did not work with the buildmachine this morning, just started cleaning now.
Try other stubs today.
[20.08.21 09:22:51] manuel: Hello. Okay.
[20.08.21 09:23:05] manuel: They didn't give me a krypt yet. I'm waiting for it. We'll see.
[20.08.21 09:23:16] dane: Yeah.
[20.08.21 09:24:10] dane: My stubs got jammed. Yesterday they collected almost 100 crypts. Today it's all in detects. (((

[20.08.21 09:51:47] dane: Bot tried to crypt with loader stub - clear. ))) Paradox. I wanted the best, turned out "as always. Well, in general, I guess you can crypt today.
[20.08.21 09:52:12] manuel: ))) so, the bot, too, can be loitered?
[20.08.21 09:52:38] dane: yeah

[02.09.21 08:46:31] dane: Hello, dear friend! )))
I cleaned shellcode 64 exe this morning. Checked it in the panel. Out of 7 crypts, one was with detection. But about the unpacking I don't know...
[02.09.21 08:47:16] manuel: 2 crypts are bad.
[02.09.21 08:47:41] dane: Have you used this stub before?
[02.09.21 08:48:24] manuel: Yes. Yesterday I had a startup detection.
[02.09.21 08:49:21] dane: And when was the last time this stub worked properly? Do you remember?
[02.09.21 08:50:22] manuel: can't remember. maybe a week ago.
[02.09.21 08:50:45] dane: I see.
[02.09.21 08:53:19] manuel: Yes, all 4 crypta vataqat b
[02.09.21 08:53:53] manuel: Can I clean it up?
[02.09.21 08:54:25] dane: I'm trying. But mine is clean...
[02.09.21 08:54:37] manuel: did you look at startup?
[02.09.21 08:58:12] dane: no, only static in avcek, dinchek
[02/09/21 08:58:49] manuel: Yep. It's just that the detection is floating, I need to look at several machines. I'll check it on one more vm...
[02.09.21 08:59:04] dane: So this detet on startup?
[02.09.21 08:59:10] manuel: Usually this detection means it's time to reinstall the system.
[02.09.21 08:59:20] manuel: Not for unzipping now
[02.09.21 08:59:26] dane: Uh-huh.
[02.09.21 08:59:29] manuel: unzipped and detected in minutes
[02.09.21 08:59:46] dane: so yeah, it's knocking on the door
[02.09.21 09:28:53] manuel: No. On another vm it also detects Wacatac.B!ml after unpacking.
[02.09.21 09:29:46] dane: Try to build some more. I changed the stub a little bit. Static is clean.
[02.09.21 09:29:54] manuel: Yep.
[02.09.21 09:44:15] manuel: Wakatak again
[02.09.21 10:00:25] dane: I crypted out a test shellcode with this stub. Checked it for dynamics.
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/e7a1b68a3ab8ff3fa2d102f13ed3e6a0
Even where the detects are written, the shellcode ran successfully.
This is the crypt I posted on VIC. Try running it on your VM.
[02.09.21 10:00:49] manuel: yeah right.
[02.09.21 10:04:48] manuel: Yeah, same thing.
[02.09.21 10:05:06] manuel: I have cloud enabled without auto send samples
[02.09.21 10:05:47] dane: Oh, man.
[02.09.21 10:06:48] dane: I have to change the stub, it takes a long time, you understand. Other stubs work?
[02.09.21 10:07:06] manuel: by ephe - no everything is dirty
[03.09.21 08:59:13] dane: Hey, buddy! They say that DllMain function appeared in Leo. Can you vic upload such loader and bot?
