[04.08.21 15:12:52] collin: regsvr32 file.dll
[04.08.21 15:13:36] manuel: thanks.
[04.08.21 15:48:45] manuel: you can see what's wrong with the bot: ddfde222ad8e39e71a768615ed31d9b4
[04.08.21 15:49:05] manuel: launched on our server vm and he disappeared from the list of bots
[04.08.21 15:49:12] manuel: and the command to run the dll hung up
[04.08.21 15:49:34] collin: he is in the registry Bots
[04.08.21 15:49:49] collin: something about padding addresses, they're not responding now
[04.08.21 15:49:55] collin: wrote to admins
[04.08.21 15:50:17] collin: bot last bounce was 15 minutes ago
[04.08.21 15:50:57] manuel: I see. Waiting for pads to rise
[04.08.21 16:06:09] collin: all gaskets are gone, Rocco is fixing it, he promises to fix it in 15 mins
[04.08.21 16:07:08] manuel: i understand. We are waiting.
[04.08.21 16:41:50] manuel: Did you raise the gaskets?
[04.08.21 16:42:19] collin: Yes, we raised today's.
[04.08.21 16:42:20] collin: You can test it.
[04.08.21 16:42:38] manuel: should I restart with clean one?
[04.08.21 16:43:33] collin: it should go up, but it might not go up soon, about 40-60 minutes
[04.08.21 16:43:44] manuel: okay, I'll restart
[04.08.21 16:58:24] manuel: On my test one, knocked out the trick through the BC. But def detected: Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml
And the file: file: c:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\1BFB.dll
[04.08.21 16:58:40] manuel: Trick itself weighs in processes and works.
[04.08.21 16:59:31] manuel: By this path does BC start the trip? Or does BK not save to hard files at all?
[04.08.21 16:59:58] collin: detected bk or tric?
[04.08.21 17:00:51] manuel: let me see the size
[04.08.21 17:00:53] collin: coder wrote in %temp% drop
[04.08.21 17:01:17] collin: what about in bot, report on command got out?
[04.08.21 17:03:51] manuel: yeah by the size it's a trick
[04.08.21 17:03:59] manuel: you got a tricuspid detector
[04.08.21 17:04:31] collin: what bot do you have?
[04.08.21 17:04:44] manuel: ddfde222ad8e39e71a768615ed31d9b4
[04.08.21 17:04:45] collin: let's see what's in the report
[04.08.21 17:05:01] collin: `The trick itself weighs in processes and works,` - so it detected it but didn't kill def?
[04.08.21 17:05:11] collin: are you sure it's a trick?
[04.08.21 17:05:55] manuel: Yes. He knocks in the admin. Then def removed the bk detector itself: Behavior:Win32/DefenseEvasion.A!ml
[04.08.21 17:06:13] manuel: Yes of course. I've been issuing this crypt from build machine myself
[04.08.21 17:06:19] manuel: I checked it on the test one
[04.08.21 17:06:27] manuel: plus trike knocks in admin
[04.08.21 17:07:05] collin: `then def deleted the bk itself ` - and the bk stopped knocking?
[04.08.21 17:07:32] manuel: I'll make a request
[04.08.21 17:07:39] manuel: Delete the dll loeder
[04.08.21 17:08:00] collin: Got it.
[04.08.21 17:10:16] manuel: BK itself reflected the request
[04.08.21 17:10:56] manuel: I'll try to restart the car and check the bounces
[04.08.21 17:13:13] collin: C:\Users\user\Downloads\1\dl2.dll - is it crypt uk, did you delete it?
[04.08.21 17:13:26] manuel: After restarting an error window: http://prntscr.com/1j37gab
[04.08.21 17:13:32] manuel: Is this a bk fix?
[04.08.21 17:13:39] manuel: yes
[04.08.21 17:14:03] manuel: and next window http://prntscr.com/1j37nwh
[04.08.21 17:14:36] collin: first one is not from BK, second one looks like a tack
[04.08.21 17:17:27] manuel: I can try with another trike crypt. Does that make sense?
[04.08.21 17:18:57] collin: let's try it
[04.08.21 17:19:04] collin: bc also make a new crypt?
[04.08.21 17:19:10] collin: probably new is better
[04.08.21 17:19:14] manuel: come on
[04.08.21 17:31:31] collin: and you can take the crypt from the panel
[04.08.21 17:31:35] collin: or better in archive?
[04.08.21 17:32:06] manuel: let me take it from the panel

[31.08.21 11:18:08] manuel: we discussed with sylver once
[31.08.21 11:18:32] collin: you never noticed it in dinchek?
[31.08.21 11:18:42] manuel: Not in dinchek
[31.08.21 11:19:01] collin: For example there were cases - repeated checks of the same file with ESET: once clean, twice - already detected
[31.08.21 11:19:06] manuel: not if you do statics.
[31.08.21 11:19:09] collin: it is not from cloud?
[31.08.21 11:20:22] manuel: I observed it in Defender too
[31.08.21 11:20:45] collin: with cloud... maybe it's on there too
[31.08.21 11:20:52] manuel: yes cloud and aggregator services
[31.08.21 11:20:53] collin: but not much leaks)
[31.08.21 12:29:12] manuel: Who's doing the BC crypto to Zeus?
[31.08.21 12:29:14] manuel: <zevs@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> give 100

[31.08.21 12:31:27] manuel: I'll text him.
[31.08.21 16:04:05] collin: tell me, do we have possibility to check statics on avcek?
[31.08.21 16:05:47] manuel: That's not clear. There's 1 test. It's not clear which one. Most likely - statics.
[31.08.21 16:06:28] collin: there's not even a statics/dynamics distinction?
[31.08.21 16:07:15] manuel: No.

[21.09.21 13:14:38] collin: hi!
[21.09.21 13:14:44] manuel: Do you remember last year we did the lowers for Target.
[21.09.21 13:15:11] manuel: Another client asks for a quiet, inconspicuous loader to download a dll file from 3-4 links and run it.
[21.09.21 13:15:18] manuel: Can we do that?
[21.09.21 13:20:44] collin: we have a universal Lauder in development now, you can't use it yet
[21.09.21 13:21:00] collin: the one I had was for exe only, plus it wasn't supported and hadn't been cleaned for over a year
[21.09.21 13:21:45] manuel: I see. And what about the universal locker?
[21.09.21 13:22:00] collin: in development, I'll specify
[21.09.21 13:25:47] manuel: And the looder that royal had?
[21.09.21 13:25:57] manuel: Can we resurrect it?
[21.09.21 13:30:10] collin: he is like and hasn't been cleaned for a long time, he needs to be updated
[21.09.21 13:30:35] collin: 1) when is it necessary by date 2) by AV what requirements, where should the dynamics be clean?
[21.09.21 13:31:13] collin: well, there's a very simple lowader, not a fact that it will work now
[21.09.21 13:32:10] collin: without any major revisions
[21.09.21 13:32:54] collin: and also 3) you need it once or permanently?
[21.09.21 13:41:36] collin: `crypts in eks have crypto, I got a manuel yesterday to build it on your phone, but I didn't have time to test it, when kacon gave me this thing I already did it all`
[21.09.21 13:41:38] collin: what kind of crypter?
[21.09.21 13:42:23] manuel: It's a crypter from stuffy, it makes a dll file
[21.09.21 13:42:34] manuel: as an exe file.
[21.09.21 13:44:47] collin: generic profile?
[21.09.21 13:45:06] manuel: I don't know exactly. More likely.
[21.09.21 13:45:34] collin: what did he say, for what tasks?
[21.09.21 13:45:47] manuel: under crypt BC from dll to ehe
[21.09.21 13:45:47] collin: for some reason BK appears in the title...
[21.09.21 13:46:01] collin: got it, I'll ask him
[21.09.21 13:46:09] collin: we just don't have any specifics in BK for crypt in exe
[21.09.21 13:46:24] manuel: I see
[21.09.21 14:26:12] manuel: one question. Zeus asks for crypto by 8 a.m. tomorrow.
[21.09.21 14:26:16] manuel: How can it be done?
[21.09.21 14:27:58] collin: we have testers who work at that time
[21.09.21 14:28:04] collin: night or morning shift?
[21.09.21 14:29:14] manuel: I can start early tomorrow
[21.09.21 14:29:27] manuel: If it's permanent, we'll think about who to hire
[21.09.21 14:31:34] manuel: Which group will it be?
[21.09.21 14:31:55] collin: 35.
[21.09.21 14:32:04] collin: Royal's doing the assembly, I'll forward it to you.
[21.09.21 14:32:15] collin: we'll make cryptos today too just in case
[21.09.21 14:33:01] manuel: you make cryptos on build machine?
[21.09.21 14:33:28] collin: yes profiles dll_bk_crypter*
[21.09.21 14:33:39] collin: dll_rundll_crypter* will also work
[21.09.21 14:33:56] manuel: I see.
[21.09.21 14:34:20] manuel: With which entry point to issue? Admin lch5nnzyb5aof43pit... Yes,
[21.09.21 14:34:24] collin: there are problems with 7 stub if the source is from gcc compiler
[21.09.21 14:34:41] collin: `Admin lch5nnzyb5aof43pit` -yes
[21.09.21 14:34:55] collin: startup via regsvrv32
[21.09.21 14:35:10] collin: that is DllRegisterServer point
[21.09.21 14:37:31] collin: on autobuilds there can be a problem: 1) with 7 stub (doesn't work with source built by gcc, c7 you can try another one from clang or msvc set if available)
[21.09.21 14:37:39] manuel: Got it.
[21.09.21 14:37:49] collin: 2) 2 stub - most likely dirty on autobuilds, because basil does it manually now
[21.09.21 14:37:55] collin: 3) 4th stub seems to be broken again
[21.09.21 14:37:56] manuel: Is it necessary to specify a point there during the build or leave the field empty?
[21.09.21 14:38:03] collin: leave it blank
[21.09.21 14:38:16] manuel: I see
[21.09.21 14:38:44] collin: issuing crypto mont@, if not then zevs@ in tor-toad
[21.09.21 14:38:52] manuel: ok.
[21.09.21 14:43:14] collin: 3 crypts they'll need
[21.09.21 14:43:37] manuel: Good.
[21.09.21 14:53:40] manuel: Answered questions on loaedr.
[21.09.21 14:54:06] manuel: 1. In the near future.
2. basic avs pure rantime.
3. we have to do it permanently.
[21.09.21 14:55:43] collin: well, then mine and royal's lauder won't fit, as long as it's permanent.
[21.09.21 14:55:52] collin: you have to wait for ryan to make his project
[21.09.21 14:56:26] collin: we spend all our time on current projects, regular cleanups are too much for us...
[21.09.21 14:58:11] manuel: I see. What about the time? Any idea when ryan will do it?
[21.09.21 15:02:06] collin: I'll get it, I'll write.
[21.09.21 15:02:17] manuel: Okay.

[21.09.21 15:22:31] collin: clang - so 7 stub will work
[21.09.21 15:22:34] manuel: ok.
[21.09.21 15:31:28] collin: `he downloaded dll file from 3-4 links and ran it` - what kind of dll startup - file or fileless (inject)?
[21.09.21 15:32:11] manuel: What's less likely to be stolen?
[21.09.21 15:32:51] collin: it's hard to say for sure
[21.09.21 15:33:11] collin: there is no fileless launch dll in uk yet, so no stats
[21.09.21 15:33:26] collin: there are pros and cons to both variants
[21.09.21 15:33:41] collin: some loads might be incompatible with fileless startup techniques
[21.09.21 15:33:46] manuel: Which is faster to implement?
[21.09.21 15:38:37] collin: the question isn't speed, but what do you want?
[21.09.21 15:39:06] collin: I'll write to Silver and he'll add you to the channel about this lowader, we'll discuss there
[21.09.21 15:39:19] manuel: Okay.
[22.09.21 07:08:11] collin: hi!
[22.09.21 07:08:46] collin: do you know if group 35 worked this morning?
[22.09.21 07:08:52] collin: no bots in the admin area
[22.09.21 09:31:08] manuel: prviet. Gave out early in the morning by 8 3 crypts 35 group
[22.09.21 09:31:33] manuel: Prvieth. Gave out early this morning at 8:00 3 crypts of group 35
[22.09.21 09:31:53] manuel: Let me ask robin
[22.09.21 09:32:09] manuel: By the way, he said that yesterday's crypts were still clean.
[22.09.21 09:32:27] collin: yeah, atlas did there, he's usually good
[22.09.21 09:32:46] collin: checked with testers - nick can go out in the morning if necessary, wild also from 7 msk
[22.09.21 09:33:16] manuel: Yes, I spoke with wild. If anything he can be charged for it.
[22.09.21 09:33:25] manuel: He's more responsible.
[22.09.21 09:34:36] manuel: Also talked to sylver about loaedr for ramon. He says that the new loeder is far from finished and offers to pick up the old work.
[22.09.21 09:34:47] manuel: Ramon is asking for a loeder to load a dll coba
[22.09.21 10:59:20] collin: did anyone else have a simple looder, except for me and Royal - do you know?
[22.09.21 10:59:35] manuel: Not that I know.
[9/22/221 11:00:00] manuel: Zeus hasn't started since this morning on europe. He has tech problems.
[22.09.21 11:00:14] manuel: He says he'll write tonight about plans for tomorrow morning.
[22.09.21 12:58:55] manuel: Ramon is ripe for a mac os BC. He asks to give it away.
[22.09.21 13:00:21] collin: It's not quite ready yet.
[22.09.21 13:00:22] collin: I will
[22.09.21 13:03:48] collin: the project is under construction, you still need to test and do
[22.09.21 13:11:48] collin: also ask about requirements for simple loader please
[22.09.21 13:12:09] collin: 1) the loeder itself should be in what format - dll/exe (if dll, what's the launch mode and entry point)
[22.09.21 13:12:24] collin: 2) what is the loeder's architecture and load
[22.09.21 13:12:41] collin: 3) what AVs should be bypassed first?
[22.09.21 13:23:44] manuel: And for mac OS do you have an understanding of the timing?
[22.09.21 13:25:39] collin: not yet
[22.09.21 13:26:06] collin: There's a Kermit who's got other things to do.
[22.09.21 13:26:13] collin: let's try to schedule it, I'll write it down.
[22.09.21 13:26:38] collin: about the simple lowader - I'll give it to our newbies
[22.09.21 13:27:05] collin: in 2 weeks first builds will go
[22.09.21 13:31:31] manuel: 1.exe fail
2.3.preferably, it was not necessary to crypto at all for point prog
I'm loading where now
they don't even crypt it
[22.09.21 13:32:56] manuel: divine> here's the deal
I'm sending traffic to the link
there's already users downloading
google chrome alert and defender need to bypass this minimum
google chrome we can bypass ...
but the rest we can't
[22.09.21 13:36:09] collin: `wishing you didn't have to crypt at all'- what do you mean, you need only source code without crypt?
[22.09.21 13:36:18] collin: or vice versa give you a ready crypt to work right away
[22.09.21 13:36:40] collin: or vice versa give me a ready crypt to work with immediately
[22.09.21 13:58:23] manuel: rhbgnKrypt to give out
[23.09.21 08:31:47] manuel: Hello.
[09/23/221 08:32:45] manuel: Last night it was too late Zeus said it would have to upload this morning. Checked yesterday's build. Everything was working. Gave me the crypts this morning. They say they're loading.
[9/23/221 08:33:04] collin: hi!
[9/23/221 08:33:08] collin: okay.
[23.09.21 08:33:39] collin: i'll write him to warn me earlier next time - i need to prepare, not for sure i'll have a fresh/working build all of a sudden
[9/23/221 08:34:40] manuel: Yeah. I was worried about live addresses too.
[9/23/221 15:11:13] collin: hi!
[23.09.21 15:11:20] collin: another question about simple lowader, about requirements
[09.23.21 15:11:31] collin: what minimum supported OS version do you need?
[23.09.21 15:11:43] collin: XP / 7
[23.09.21 15:11:46] manuel: 7 - 10
[9/23/221 15:11:52] collin: okay.
[23.09.21 16:47:31] manuel: Mont says to prepare dll build for morning
[23.09.21 16:48:22] collin: so there's no new one for today, and no one will do it now
[23.09.21 16:48:30] collin: The old one must be dirty
[23.09.21 16:48:38] manuel: <bentley> bro, tell me, tomorrow morning also give out crypto dll uk for europe?

[23.09.21 16:49:19] collin: if the addresses didn't go down, we'll get it ready
[9/23/221 16:49:24] manuel: Okay.
[23.09.21 16:49:28] manuel: And who will give it out?
[23.09.21 16:49:37] collin: Wild is ready tomorrow
[23.09.21 16:49:40] collin: let me check.

[27.09.21 14:49:15] collin: I gave the task to two coders

[30.09.21 16:03:48] collin: Why are they called shellcode?
[30.09.21 16:04:03] collin: they are just dll, PE structure, right?
[30.09.21 16:04:15] manuel: No. He says shellcode
[30.09.21 16:19:48] collin: how did you crypt them, what stub/parameters?
[30.09.21 16:20:00] collin: I mean, like it should be

[30.09.21 17:11:23] collin: I'll write it tomorrow.
[01.10.21 14:46:16] manuel: Hello.
[01.10.21 14:46:51] manuel: I wanted to ask you about the shk I did yesterday by hand
[01.10.21 14:47:15] manuel: You said you can add stub to build machine
[01.10.21 14:47:21] collin: hi!
[01.10.21 14:47:27] collin: stubs are the same
[01.10.21 14:47:38] collin: we fixed the panel itself, now these stubs are available for any files
[01.10.21 14:47:42] manuel: Yes, but this shk is not defined in build-machine as she
[01.10.21 14:47:45] collin: including shellcodes in this new format
[01.10.21 14:48:00] collin: not detected because it has PE structure
[01.10.21 14:48:06] manuel: found it sorry for the distraction
[01.10.21 14:48:41] collin: maybe you could somehow classify it as a shk
[01.10.21 14:48:52] collin: but it's not clear right away, you'll have to think about it
[01.10.21 14:49:21] manuel: Yeah. The main thing is you can crypto
[24.10.21 14:06:01] manuel: Hi. Awesome!
[24.10.21 14:06:55] manuel: Okay. Waiting. Test and tomorrow morning sam will do the cryptos.
[24.10.21 14:40:30] manuel: Got the sources. Remind me, how do you make the bot knock faster in the admin area and not wait 10 minutes between admin commands?
[24.10.21 14:40:40] manuel: If you need to test the functionality faster
[24.10.21 14:42:37] manuel: okay, thanks.
