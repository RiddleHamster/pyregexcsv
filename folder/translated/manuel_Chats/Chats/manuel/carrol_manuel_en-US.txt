[20.09.21 17:04:47] manuel: Good evening. Can you help me? Crypts won't build with stub dll_rundll_crypter4. Error failed and I was building some time ago.
[20.09.21 17:40:28] carrol: Good evening, I don't know, what does the author say? in Jenkins you can see the crash reason
[20.09.21 17:40:54] manuel: Vj;tim gjcvjnhtnm&
[20.09.21 17:41:00] manuel: can you look?
[20.09.21 17:41:35] carrol: no, you can only access your project
[20.09.21 17:41:50] manuel: I see.
[20.09.21 17:43:57] carrol: maybe orval can, he's for elroy
[20.09.21 17:44:10] manuel: okay.
[29.09.21 16:57:13] manuel: Hello. Can you help me?
[29.09.21 16:57:55] carrol: Hi.
[29.09.21 16:58:06] carrol: Describe the problem
[29.09.21 16:58:21] manuel: I can't upload new shk to buildmachine. they are detected as dll with DLL functions: ReflectiveLoader
[29.09.21 16:58:30] carrol: shk?
[29.09.21 16:58:40] manuel: Yes binary with vinyl code
[29.09.21 16:59:00] carrol: give me a load
[29.09.21 17:00:02] manuel: Put two files in Carrol's tab
[29.09.21 17:00:03] carrol: so you must get a dll with ReflectiveLoader function?
[29.09.21 17:00:15] manuel: No, the output should be StartW
[29.09.21 17:00:37] manuel: dll with entry point StartW
[29.09.21 17:00:41] carrol: ReflectiveLoader is what?
[29.09.21 17:01:12] manuel: Not clear. It appears in the build-machine and because of that there is no way to crypto-dll
[29.09.21 17:02:02] carrol: no you don't have shellcode
[29.09.21 17:02:15] carrol: it's a x64 dll
[29.09.21 17:03:36] carrol: yeah right
[29.09.21 17:04:07] manuel: when I cry as a dll, it doesn't work either
[29.09.21 17:04:46] carrol: let me try
[29.09.21 17:09:07] carrol: it worked, look in my dll_rundll_crypter7
ReflectiveLoader=StartW
[29.09.21 17:09:09] carrol: shellcode is not that big, loads with shellcode are small
[29.09.21 17:09:37] manuel: Yeah.
[29.09.21 17:09:43] manuel: Then you can check it out.
[29.09.21 17:09:47] carrol: Okay.
[29.09.21 17:10:24] carrol: if Ikarus or WD script do it
[29.09.21 17:10:39] carrol: I'll be gone for half an hour
[29.09.21 17:10:41] manuel: ok
[29.09.21 17:10:44] manuel: thank you.
[29.09.21 17:35:02] manuel: They said (((( doesn't work
[29.09.21 18:12:44] carrol: try other cryptors, maybe mine is the only one that doesn't work
[29.09.21 18:12:58] manuel: Yeah
[29.09.21 18:29:31] carrol: by the way, maybe it's leo or something, that's why it doesn't work, what profile should I use?
[29.09.21 18:30:13] manuel: No it's a shellcode
[29.09.21 18:30:23] manuel: So they say
[29.09.21 18:30:30] carrol: lying
[29.09.21 18:30:38] carrol: lying
[29.09.21 18:30:47] carrol: what about the rocket
[29.09.21 18:31:04] carrol: they're lying
[29.09.21 18:32:18] carrol: aaaa I got it, shell code is built into DOS loader header, there's some code there
[29.09.21 18:32:49] carrol: then it must be encrypted not as dll load but as exe yfuhepre
[29.09.21 18:32:57] carrol: load
[29.09.21 18:33:05] manuel: will you get a dll as an output?
[29.09.21 18:33:11] manuel: Or only in ehe?
[29.09.21 18:33:23] carrol: yeah EXE to DLL
[29.09.21 18:33:34] carrol: well, yes EXE in DLL
[29.09.21 18:34:07] manuel: Yeah
[29.09.21 18:34:10] manuel: I'll try it now
[29.09.21 18:34:49] carrol: but build machine won't let you choose the right profile, because it defines it as a dll
[29.09.21 18:36:18] manuel: Yeah, it only gives dll_generic_crypter5
[29.09.21 18:37:02] carrol: but my generator won't handle such situation either, there was no such a task
[29.09.21 18:38:01] carrol: well, you have to ask people in the topic, I am not help here
[29.09.21 18:38:35] manuel: Who to write?
[29.09.21 18:38:48] carrol: orval
[29.09.21 18:38:58] carrol: maybe he knows
[29.09.21 18:45:20] carrol: no, I made a mistake, I checked it wrong
[22.11.21 19:42:12] manuel: good evening. can you crypt the ehe trike?
[22.11.21 19:43:06] carrol: Hi, alas everything is dirty, need to redo the stub, not clean ((
[22.11.21 19:43:20] manuel: I see...
[29.11.21 18:24:15] manuel: Good evening. Can you crypt the trica echo?
[29.11.21 18:30:37] carrol: Hi. No dirty yet, alas))
[29.11.21 18:31:15] manuel: Got it.
[29.11.21 18:31:38] carrol: although you can try, what load?
[29.11.21 18:32:11] manuel: cbg1.bin in uncrypted
[29.11.21 18:32:30] carrol: ok
[29.11.21 18:34:27] carrol: in exe?
[29.11.21 18:34:50] manuel: yes
[29.11.21 18:37:56] carrol: no, alas, small loads sometimes work, large - two detections
[29.11.21 18:38:25] manuel: I see. Thanks
[03.12.21 16:39:10] manuel: prviet. Can you krypt stab leo loaders and dll bots?
[03.12.21 16:57:59] carrol: Hi
[03.12.21 16:58:10] carrol: still relevant?
[03.12.21 16:58:14] manuel: Yes
[03.12.21 16:58:27] manuel: just need clean autocheck
[03.12.21 16:58:29] carrol: where to get it?
[03.12.21 16:58:48] manuel: I'll send it over
[03.12.21 16:59:09] carrol: bookmark carrol
[03.12.21 16:59:16] manuel: Okay.
[03.12.21 17:03:48] manuel: fill 4 files: 2 bots 2 lowers
[03.12.21 17:04:19] carrol: ok
[03.12.21 17:04:38] carrol: are the panels dirty?
[03.12.21 17:04:53] manuel: yes
[03.12.21 17:04:58] manuel: and some of the bids don't work
[03.12.21 17:05:14] carrol: exactly mine?
[03.12.21 17:06:11] manuel: what's your number?
[03.12.21 17:08:45] carrol: 7
[03.12.21 17:09:39] manuel: I think there was a bot not working and a lauder when I was building
[03.12.21 17:09:47] manuel: rather, bot worked, and loeder didn't
[03.12.21 17:10:35] carrol: but they were clean?
[03.12.21 17:10:46] manuel: don't remember
[03.12.21 17:10:50] manuel: did it 3 days ago
[03.12.21 17:10:59] carrol: i made one clean one on avcek
[03.12.21 17:11:05] manuel: awesome!
[03.12.21 17:11:13] carrol: try in the panel, they should be clean
[03.12.21 17:11:29] carrol: I mean generate
[03.12.21 17:11:39] manuel: yeah I'll try that
[03.12.21 17:11:48] manuel: both lowder and bot with one stub?
[03.12.21 17:12:02] carrol: I'll put one in carrol
[03.12.21 17:12:52] carrol: i don't know, everything should work if not write me
[03.12.21 17:13:53] manuel: ok
[03.12.21 17:15:04] carrol: take one
[03.12.21 17:17:37] carrol: listen, this lowader is soooo dirty on static, probably all ABs will detect it on dynamic
[03.12.21 17:18:05] carrol: windef probably kills it on startup
[03.12.21 17:18:12] manuel: yeah, they complained a lot about it, especially on node32
[03.12.21 17:19:23] carrol: i'm not an expert in these things, but i think you should not let such a load to work, we'll work in vain, the first crypt will get in
[03.12.21 17:20:38] carrol: I looked inside loader, it doesn't hide itself at all, even its name is loader.dll
[03.12.21 17:20:57] manuel: do you need to clean source code?
[03.12.21 17:21:06] carrol: sure
[03.12.21 17:21:39] carrol: ask Elroy, I think he's still here, I could be wrong, I don't know much
[03.12.21 17:31:10] manuel: ``
 He says right. The load will fly in and burn the crypt afterwards.
That's exactly the way it is on one side.
But there's another side.
As rozetka wrote out today in that chat
It is not important that everything is clean, it is important that the av which is online is clean.
It depends on how you work.
Who cares about what.
Did they ask you specifically for food?
5:25 PM
yes the question is that the outlet knows what kind of food to cook under
I've been asked for food on avcek
and especially node32
5:26 PM
Well then it is really illogical to distribute such a thing
But maybe they need food on static just to send the file to a place where there is no AV
For example
5:27 PM
quite
5:27 PM.
They take a handful of files and check them on the Seth machine, clean, then copy the files to somewhere where there is no AB on the machines anymore.
This strategy could be.
In general, just consider that if you have a grainy source on static, it is useless to run it from AV, all will be spoiled
If you need such a thing, let's make a crypt then))
5:28 PM
Isn't it cleaned by krypt?
5:28 PM
Kryptom cleans statics
5:28 PM
Yes
5:29 PM.
As soon as it is launched somewhere, it will work with dynamics and AV will mark that this file is malicious, leak the information to the network and it won't pass through statics any more. In other words, it is for one run in this case.
But it also happens.....

```
[03.12.21 17:32:09] manuel: And you can also crypt the bot. Bildmachine doesn't work yet, I think.
[03.12.21 17:32:24] carrol: ok, now
[03.12.21 17:32:27] manuel: I've been crittin' for an hour now.
