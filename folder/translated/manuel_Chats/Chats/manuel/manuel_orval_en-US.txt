[02.09.21 15:22:30] orval: let me see
[02.09.21 15:51:49] orval: can you load it?
[02.09.21 15:52:06] manuel: where do I put it?
[02.09.21 15:53:29] orval: on the panel

[02.09.21 17:20:30] orval: thank you.
[02.09.21 17:21:24] orval: cleared
[02.09.21 17:21:33] orval: should I drop the cript or can you do it yourself?
[02.09.21 17:21:59] orval: only there is a delay crutch there now, just did 16 pings to localhost
[02.09.21 17:22:08] orval: will it work?
[02.09.21 17:22:29] manuel: Yes, quite. Can I recrypt 10 with stub?

[02.09.21 19:36:42] manuel: Yes
[02.09.21 19:42:16] orval: now there's something wrong with the build machine
[02.09.21 19:42:28] manuel: it happens...
[02.09.21 19:43:02] orval: if you need it now, I can send it off
[02.09.21 19:43:15] manuel: not tomorrow then
[02.09.21 19:45:54] orval: there was already such a problem with Jenkins, it resolved somehow by itself. Crypt has external dependencies, it should download everything by itself, but ssl certificates error
[02.09.21 19:46:10] orval: somehow it happens from time to time
[02.09.21 19:46:22] orval: either demetrius is spinning something

[06.09.21 17:08:16] manuel: Yeah.
[06.09.21 17:23:37] orval: tab orv last file, run from cmd should print the string ``Hello World!"
[06.09.21 17:23:51] manuel: how to run?
[06.09.21 17:23:58] orval: what kind of test machines do we have?
[06.09.21 17:24:09] orval: just from cmd file
[06.09.21 17:29:46] manuel: we have 10 7 2019 2008 on the test machine

[06.09.21 17:41:16] orval: just check which file won't work and give it to me
[06.09.21 17:41:45] manuel: well
[06.09.21 17:42:03] manuel: so hard they have their own machines and they can't give access
[06.09.21 17:46:14] orval: don't need the same car
[06.09.21 17:46:20] orval: error just need to reproduce
[06.09.21 17:46:30] orval: machine with no runtime
[06.09.21 17:46:34] manuel: I see.
[06.09.21 17:47:35] manuel: I'll get it right now.
[06.09.21 17:47:56] manuel: are there any logs collected there? Or just run and check if it works?
[06.09.21 17:48:13] orval: just show it in console
[06.09.21 17:48:19] orval: but I need the car
[06.09.21 17:48:23] orval: that would take too long
[06.09.21 17:49:11] manuel: got it
[06.09.21 17:57:12] manuel: I can't give you access.
[06.09.21 17:58:12] orval: okay, I'll look at the autofarm
[06.09.21 17:58:59] manuel: Yeah.

[20.09.21 19:07:39] manuel: No. You can start and start
[20.09.21 19:07:51] manuel: I checked with startup and it's not encrypted
[20.09.21 19:10:54] orval: there's StartW in the export anyway
[20.09.21 19:11:17] orval: this field is for renaming names of exported functions
[20.09.21 19:12:02] manuel: How do you encrypt in this case?
[20.09.21 19:14:17] orval: what exactly do you want?

[24.09.21 11:47:22] manuel: Don't do it anymore.
[24.09.21 12:00:09] orval: software is a load?
[24.09.21 12:00:16] orval: I thought I did)
[24.09.21 12:00:37] manuel: Yes load
[24.09.21 12:00:44] manuel: YES did it.)
[24.09.21 12:01:21] orval: but this profile is the hardest by detects
[24.09.21 12:01:52] orval: he probably won't last long
[24.09.21 12:07:26] manuel: Yeah.
[29.09.21 09:27:59] orval: hello
[29.09.21 09:28:06] orval: what's the load?
[29.09.21 09:28:14] manuel: bot leo
[29.09.21 09:28:22] manuel: Send you?
[29.09.21 09:28:46] orval: can you put it on the panel?
[29.09.21 09:29:17] manuel: Where do I put it?
[29.09.21 09:29:24] orval: orv
[29.09.21 09:30:14] manuel: I uploaded dll_64_prj_Jeep.dll
[29.09.21 09:33:39] orval: there is DllMain in the export
[29.09.21 09:33:58] orval: I'll redo the crypt, it takes about 15 minutes
[29.09.21 09:34:04] manuel: Welcome.
[29.09.21 09:34:10] manuel: Was it different before?
[29.09.21 09:34:21] manuel: I can send you the one from yesterday that worked
[29.09.21 09:34:32] manuel: And the lowder was crypto today
[29.09.21 09:35:36] orval: hadn't seen DllMain in export before, relatively recently there was a need to crypt out such a load with a uk profile, that's why they adjusted for it. Usually the entry point is DllMain, and here in the code is a function with the same name, so there is a conflict
[29.09.21 09:36:11] orval: yesterday's one must have had a different export
[29.09.21 09:36:37] manuel: will loader work with this stub?
[29.09.21 09:37:41] manuel: Filled you loader and yesterday's bot.
[29.09.21 09:41:51] orval: yesterday's bot was crypto?
[29.09.21 09:42:01] manuel: Yes.

[29.09.21 09:42:27] manuel: yeah.
[29.09.21 09:42:35] manuel: I'll try crypting it again
[29.09.21 09:46:10] manuel: Now on yesterday's one too Failed
[29.09.21 09:46:28] orval: yeah, maybe you were crypting
[29.09.21 09:47:17] manuel: Nope, not BK
[29.09.21 09:47:23] manuel: I always do Leo
[29.09.21 09:48:26] orval: today's one

[29.09.21 18:03:58] manuel: Poured in orv
[29.09.21 18:12:57] orval: so it really didn't go
[29.09.21 18:13:08] manuel: Yeah, but they say it did
[29.09.21 18:13:16] manuel: and when you crypto as a dll, it doesn't work either

[30.09.21 08:55:37] orval: I can do it manually
[30.09.21 08:55:41] manuel: They say it's silk
[30.09.21 08:55:47] orval: just probably won't work
[30.09.21 08:55:53] orval: okay, I will
[30.09.21 08:56:07] orval: what size and what profile?
[30.09.21 08:56:22] manuel: 64 dll and ec
[30.09.21 08:56:44] orval: generic, I guess?
[30.09.21 08:57:01] manuel: uploaded to your tab
[30.09.21 08:57:18] manuel: generic didn't work yesterday
[30.09.21 12:06:15] orval: figured it out?
[30.09.21 12:06:54] manuel: I gave it to him to check. Waiting to hear what they say.
[30.09.21 12:40:27] manuel: No, it didn't work.
[30.09.21 12:40:40] manuel: crypt on build machine
[30.09.21 12:48:11] manuel: Filled new cobalt profile into crypters
[30.09.21 12:48:16] manuel: Hope it helps
[30.09.21 13:17:06] manuel: Can you help with crypt?
[30.09.21 13:18:41] orval: yes now
[30.09.21 13:37:48] orval: all set
[30.09.21 13:38:15] manuel: How do I do it?
[30.09.21 13:38:47] orval: you mean the one that didn't move?
[30.09.21 13:39:04] manuel: yes
[30.09.21 13:43:22] orval: does this file generate itself?
[30.09.21 13:44:24] manuel: no
[30.09.21 13:45:28] orval: and not what you threw in the confab with cobalt?
[30.09.21 13:55:30] manuel: yes
[30.09.21 14:06:35] orval: I'm not familiar with cobalt at all, if you remove the .bin extension and call rundll 1.dll load, will it work?
[30.09.21 14:06:42] orval: should it work?
[30.09.21 14:08:01] manuel: I was crypting like this and it didn't work
[30.09.21 14:08:18] orval: how about running load without crypt?
[30.09.21 14:08:25] orval: can you get cobalt somewhere?
[30.09.21 14:09:06] manuel: what do you mean?
[30.09.21 14:09:12] orval: hugo said he's doing something for you
[30.09.21 14:09:17] orval: cobalt himself
[30.09.21 14:09:22] manuel: yeah
[30.09.21 14:09:31] manuel: cobalt
[30.09.21 14:09:48] orval: can you get cobalt itself somewhere?
[30.09.21 14:10:02] orval: the program
[30.09.21 14:12:55] manuel: source from which shk and exe and dll are made?
[30.09.21 14:15:07] orval: well, yeah, but it's just for me
[30.09.21 14:15:26] orval: should the exe knock?
[30.09.21 14:16:14] manuel: yes
[30.09.21 14:16:17] manuel: asked
[30.09.21 14:16:41] manuel: probably in his web service and it generates everything
[30.09.21 14:20:00] orval: he can't tell you how to run it without crypt
[30.09.21 14:20:04] orval: ?
[30.09.21 14:20:13] orval: while exe which
[30.09.21 14:25:22] orval: sc_http_111_x64_exe.bin I run it with rundll and it crashes
[30.09.21 14:25:35] orval: rundll32 sc_http_111_x64_exe.bin.dll,ReflectiveLoader
[30.09.21 14:25:40] orval: doesn't work by itself
[30.09.21 14:28:36] manuel: ask
[30.09.21 14:29:58] orval: also tried just call entry point through LoadLibrary it ran and returned controls
[30.09.21 14:42:28] manuel: does that mean it works?
[30.09.21 14:52:08] orval: well, no bounce
[30.09.21 14:52:28] orval: I guess all the functionality should be in the exported function
[30.09.21 14:52:49] orval: and this is how dllmain defotl
[30.09.21 14:53:11] orval: control returned instantly
[30.09.21 14:54:04] manuel: maybe

[01.02.22 17:56:47] manuel: on Leo's stub, when crypting bot an error was coming out:
[01.02.22 17:57:01] manuel: Bot starts but does not re-tap
[01.02.22 17:57:07] manuel: ``
 I do GetModuleFileNameA(hModule, ...) at DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH in DLL EntryPoint.
Then I don't use hModule anywhere else, so the main thing is that in this place GetModuleFileNameA returns the correct dll name
Otherwise updates to the bot will not work. If you run it without a loader, the install will not work.
bot can not start itself, writes startup error
