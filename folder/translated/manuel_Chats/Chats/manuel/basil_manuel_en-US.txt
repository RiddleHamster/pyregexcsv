[15.09.21 10:53:58] manuel: Hi.
[15.09.21 10:55:47] basil: Elroy wrote here. Said that kind of crypt doesn't work on some shellcode. Now tested on test files from cryptopanel. It worked correctly. Have you checked the shellcode itself for functionality?
[15.09.21 11:06:02] manuel: Yes. The other stub works.
[15.09.21 11:07:00] basil: Okay. To know which entry point to use and how to test it
[15.09.21 11:07:02] basil: ?
[15.09.21 11:07:37] manuel: How to send?
[15.09.21 11:08:29] basil: well, maybe via file sharing
[15.09.21 11:43:50] manuel: Here are the sources.

[16.09.21 13:33:33] basil: hello
[16.09.21 13:33:58] manuel: is there a possibility to crypt by hand at least dll?
[16.09.21 13:35:08] basil: I can try again. But so far unfortunately falls down.
[16.09.21 13:35:58] basil: what do you know?
[16.09.21 13:36:44] manuel: I can send you source code to crypto.
[16.09.21 13:36:54] basil: if you can
[16.09.21 13:37:01] manuel: Where can I send it?
[16.09.21 13:37:28] basil: well, it's especially important to me. Wherever is more convenient for you.
[16.09.21 13:37:52] manuel: tab in cryptopanel
[16.09.21 13:38:00] manuel: But let's archive it here

[16.09.21 13:44:01] basil: or by "source" you mean something else?
[16.09.21 13:54:04] manuel: yeah, the engine builds a new one for each new server
