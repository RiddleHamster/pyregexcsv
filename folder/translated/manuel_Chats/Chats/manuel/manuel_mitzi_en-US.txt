[17.11.21 09:18:22] manuel: He just wants a licenses for his computers
[17.11.21 09:19:05] mitzi: I don't buy it, I just pay for servers
[17.11.21 09:19:50] mitzi: It's probably for a buyer
[17.11.21 09:19:59] manuel: And who buys from us?
[17.11.21 09:20:41] mitzi: I don't know, if I need to pay I go to Demeter or Silver, Demeter is on vacation till 25
[17.11.21 09:21:26] manuel: I don't even know where to find it yet
[17.11.21 09:22:07] mitzi: Maybe in the general chat ask contacts of buyers, if there are they now, I think there were
[17.11.21 09:22:56] mitzi: they then make a report spent, I do not even know, I just have a list of servers to pay for
[17.11.21 09:24:43] mitzi: also wondered, I need to buy software, but I'll ask demeter when it comes out
[17.11.21 09:26:07] mitzi: Do you have a teammate? I have a demeter, I'd ask, but he's not in touch.

[10.12.21 10:09:24] manuel: We have one on the farm, right?
[10.12.21 10:10:29] mitzi: There is of course, but everyone has his own VMs, so just no free,
We have to do it separately.
[10.12.21 10:10:52] manuel: Can you do it for me?
[10.12.21 10:10:59] mitzi: Did you have something on your old farm?

[10.12.21 10:11:27] mitzi: moment
[10.12.21 10:12:04] mitzi: we didn't transfer you
[10.12.21 10:12:15] manuel: Eh... Nothing.
[10.12.21 10:12:24] manuel: Can you make me cars?
[10.12.21 10:12:36] mitzi: I need to discuss with demeter at this point either to transfer them or start you from scratch
[10.12.21 10:12:48] mitzi: to proxmox
[10.12.21 10:12:52] manuel: Yeah, start from scratch if it's easier.
[10.12.21 10:13:02] manuel: there's nothing to transfer
[10.12.21 10:13:08] manuel: nothing else
[10.12.21 10:13:16] mitzi: okay, but it's not fast enough
[10.12.21 10:13:26] manuel: Can you guide me?
[10.12.21 10:13:53] mitzi: so you need for a software test
7 8 10 Server 2016 2019
5 VM.
[10.12.21 10:14:05] manuel: yes
[10.12.21 10:14:48] mitzi: ok the moment demeter will write, I need to calculate the load, as if there are slots in reserve, otherwise I will have to upgrade RAM again
[10.12.21 10:15:02] mitzi: let's solve the problem
[10.12.21 10:15:04] manuel: ok
[10.12.21 10:25:14] mitzi: it's ok, I've agreed with Demetr, I will deploy VMs for you
[10.12.21 10:25:36] manuel: Great!
[10.12.21 10:26:39] mitzi: you are now what priority?, look i saw the axis set up, then give gator he saws RDP and leads you to proxmox as a user, snaps to do their own, etc,
I usually send him a bunch of them he saws them, 2-5 pcs,
[10.12.21 10:27:13] mitzi: one at a time it will take him a long time
till tonight, I think I will deploy 3 VMs,
[10.12.21 10:27:26] manuel: 8 2019 2016 then 7 10 and ideally a cheek 11
[10.12.21 10:27:36] mitzi: 11 is
[10.12.21 10:27:36] manuel: Okay.
[10.12.21 10:27:41] manuel: Great!
[10.12.21 10:28:19] mitzi: already tested it, I fucked up putting it on virtual machine all day long, but the main thing is to have instructions)
