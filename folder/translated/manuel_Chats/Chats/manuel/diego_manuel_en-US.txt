[26.01.22 12:29:54] manuel: I don't quite understand.
[26.01.22 12:30:10] manuel: Maybe. The idea is to make a lot of other cryptos with it.

[27.01.22 08:11:49] manuel: As far as I know it has no 32 bit load. Or you mean 32 bit systems?

[27.01.22 08:12:39] manuel: Yes.
[27.01.22 08:12:51] manuel: Have you been dumped on the latest loader changes?
[27.01.22 08:13:01] diego: no
[27.01.22 08:13:22] manuel: ``
<merch> bot startup:
rundll32.exe bot.dll,DllMain --zzzz="test\bp.dat"
DllMain - entry point,
--zzzz - parameter
"test\bp.dat" - parameter value


When starting the bot as a DLL, I do the following
1) In EntryPoint.
+ store the hModule.
+ start the thread

2) In the thread itself, I do the following
GetModuleFileNameA(g_hModule, LoaderFileName, MAX_PATH);

Thereby LoaderFileName should refer to the bot file. Then I already use this value in another place and make installation - copying, prescribing in the autorun, etc. And the problem is that GetModuleFileNameA returns either an error or LoaderFileName is empty.
---
1) GetModuleFileName(hModule) dll should return real file name on your drive, otherwise you might have problems with installation and updates
2) Crpter should not check file CRC (code sections in particular) or TimeSpamp or Crc from PE header, moni could change during installation.

and the lowader:

and the downloader has no parameters
run with the commands
regsvr32 loader.dll
rundll32 loader.dll,DllRegisterServer
rundll32 loader.dll,DllGetClassObject

where the entry point can be DllRegisterServer or DllGetClassObject

--------
<merch> it does not matter for the loader at all, because it does not ask for its name. i.e. the bot will install and start from it normally.
But the bot itself (after reboot) if GetModuleFileName does not work correctly already will glitch update (the loader and botpack itself). And also there may be glitches with instal - it will try to install at every start.

init (loader) in EntryPoint stores the specified hModule and then when exported DllMain function is started, it starts a thread in which botpack is started. How to do GetModuleFileNameA(hModule) to tell the botpack the file name. Then botpac uses this file name to check installation and also to restart during update.

-------

1) In EntryPoint
+ remembering hModule

2) when the exported DllMain function is called, it starts a thread and waits for it to finish
3) the thread itself does GetModuleFileNameA(g_hModule, LoaderFileName, MAX_PATH);
on the basis of which it already defines its name to install and restart
```
[27.01.22 08:13:35] manuel: This is what I have on the looder and bot
[27.01.22 08:27:19] diego: there in the test dll as a message was outputted value GetModuleFileName. In theory, if it works, then the rest will work

[09.02.22 08:32:28] manuel: Will you be able to crimp Leo's stub?
[09.02.22 08:34:28] diego: hi! Sadly so far, the code is 70% identical. And that, I take it, is a bad indicator
[09.02.22 08:35:26] manuel: I don't know exactly how by TK
[09.02.22 08:35:34] manuel: And if you just use an ordinary stub?
[09.02.22 08:35:41] manuel: Everything is dirty in the build machine
[09.02.22 08:36:19] diego: I think it was NOD
[09.02.22 08:36:39] manuel: Yeah, he's on almost every stub on the autocell
[09.02.22 08:37:49] diego: now you can clean up from NOD and so script, and then solve the question on the hash
[09.02.22 08:39:21] diego: if you like it, throw the load, I'll kryptonu and look at the detects
[09.02.22 08:40:06] manuel: Let's do it that way. because I can't give it to anyone
[09.02.22 08:40:11] manuel: I'll send it over.
