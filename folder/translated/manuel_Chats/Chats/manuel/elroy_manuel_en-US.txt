[27.07.21 11:08:13] manuel: Hello. Tell me, how do I send you the load? In an archive in folders?
[27.07.21 11:08:28] elroy: You can put it in a tab
[27.07.21 11:08:40] elroy: As you wish.
[27.07.21 11:08:44] elroy: You can send it as an archive.)
[27.07.21 11:09:07] elroy: So I only know what profile it's encrypted with and what it's called
[27.07.21 11:10:11] manuel: Ok, I will.
[27.07.21 12:41:52] manuel: Done

[27.07.21 13:03:44] elroy: Funny, he did not let me download the file, said no
[27.07.21 13:03:52] elroy: Can you upload it again?
[27.07.21 13:04:14] elroy: Orval will write there about the vakatak
[27.07.21 13:04:37] manuel: https://privatlab.com/s/v/9mmYO9bz0JTeVNZg4Gqk
[27.07.21 13:04:42] elroy: Give him what's wrong with him, I have an idea how to get rid of the detector, just need to check
[27.07.21 13:04:44] manuel: Password's the same
[27.07.21 13:04:48] elroy: Okay.
[27.07.21 13:05:15] manuel: It's been a week since he had a job.
[27.07.21 13:05:33] elroy: disappeared by himself?)
[27.07.21 13:05:36] elroy: Wow.
[27.07.21 13:05:45] elroy: Wasn't on any car?
[27.07.21 13:05:49] manuel: I haven't. Last one was cloxer.
[27.07.21 13:05:59] manuel: I don't have one. I'll ask the Uefrein.
[29.07.21 09:12:23] elroy: Greetings.
[29.07.21 09:13:06] manuel: hi.
[29.07.21 09:14:34] elroy: I'm about that problem with the scans. There may have been a dincheck error somewhere in there today... But the panel has grown lately, lots of tasks for scans + morning builds with scans so we can see the charts on stubs... Anyway, time to expand the account.
[29.07.21 09:15:00] manuel: I agree. I'm waiting for francis to come, we'll pay for the expansion.
[29.07.21 09:15:07] elroy: silver referred to you to buy a new one.
[29.07.21 09:15:31] manuel: There is 1 more account, but I have to put some money on it
[29.07.21 09:16:26] elroy: I'm interested in two things, how to speed scans, ie maybe take a few cheap, but with an unlimited on the scan, and in parallel make them scan, would be in general faster
[29.07.21 09:16:33] elroy: And the number, of course
[29.07.21 09:16:47] elroy: I'm looking at the rates, there's no limit everywhere
[29.07.21 09:17:22] manuel: No, there is a limit of simultaneous scanning, limit the number of scans per 1 hour and per 1 day
[29.07.21 09:18:06] elroy: What's the rate for the panel now?
[29.07.21 09:18:24] manuel: Premium+
[29.07.21 09:56:28] manuel: Dinchek is on
[29.07.21 09:56:53] elroy: Yeah, okay.
[29.07.21 09:57:06] elroy: Is it possible to have a separate account for the panel?
[29.07.21 09:57:22] manuel: now there is a scan in 2 streams and 1000 per day and 100 per hour limit
[29.07.21 09:57:53] elroy: That's good
[29.07.21 09:58:04] manuel: let's see how 2 streams will work
[29.07.21 09:58:13] elroy: Good
[03.08.21 15:05:00] manuel: Prviet. Need clean stubs on silkode. There is only 1 clean 2 left.
[03.08.21 15:05:32] elroy: That's the one I cleaned recently...
[03.08.21 15:05:37] elroy: Greetings.
[03.08.21 15:05:43] manuel: Okay.
[03.08.21 15:05:44] elroy: Okay, I'll tell the guys.
[03.08.21 15:05:49] manuel: And the others?
[03.08.21 15:06:00] manuel: They look like they haven't been cleaned in a while.
[03.08.21 15:06:02] elroy: orval is gone, but carrol isn't out yet. That only leaves dane.
[03.08.21 15:06:16] manuel: on vacation?
[03.08.21 15:07:01] manuel: dane has no stub for 64 bit dll
[03.08.21 15:07:10] elroy: The others too, I cleaned on the first and second generic rundll and for shellcodes. I'll update the rest a bit later. But the eset is already bored((.
[03.08.21 15:07:28] manuel: only 32 bit dll 64 bit ehe and 32 bit ehe
[03.08.21 15:07:36] manuel: Yes it is
[03.08.21 15:07:43] manuel: 5 was clean this morning and now it's detecting
[03.08.21 15:08:04] elroy: Do series two and one, try series others.
I'm just setting up parallel series crypts right now, will be a pretty fast series (six threads in parallel)
[03.08.21 15:08:21] manuel: Great
[03.08.21 15:17:40] elroy: Try crypter 9 again for shellcodes. There orval forgot to clean garbage, might have affected
[03.08.21 15:17:44] elroy: Fixed it
[03.08.21 15:17:54] manuel: Good
[03.08.21 15:26:36] manuel: 2 stub silkcodes started getting picked up by eset: https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/3640d6fc07f18afca51157253dce69b1
[03.08.21 15:29:56] elroy: Oh, fuck it....
[03.08.21 15:30:20] elroy: The whole series?
[03.08.21 15:30:47] manuel: check it out
[03.08.21 15:31:29] elroy: Try to clean up
[03.08.21 15:31:44] manuel: Thanks
[03.08.21 15:47:47] manuel: Yes, the series also detected
[03.08.21 15:49:38] elroy: Okay, I'm on it.
[03.08.21 15:50:26] manuel: 9 for now. it's clean.
[03.08.21 16:18:23] elroy: And what shellcode was crypted? Now crypted both in my panel, files are clean
[03.08.21 16:18:45] manuel: I'll send it to you right now.
[03.08.21 16:19:06] elroy: Or just a file in the panel
[03.08.21 16:19:30] manuel: sc_https_x64_dll.bin in my tab
[03.08.21 16:19:40] elroy: looking
[05.08.21 13:30:59] manuel: Hello. I need help on the stubs silkode - eche 64. 2, 9, 6 are straying.
[05.08.21 13:31:03] manuel: nothing to crypt
[05.08.21 13:45:20] elroy: Try the second series, pick from there
[05.08.21 13:45:25] elroy: Which shellcode?
[05.08.21 13:45:37] manuel: I'll try.
[05.08.21 13:45:51] manuel: sc_https_x64_exe.bin in my tab
[05.08.21 13:46:06] manuel: Ransom:Win32/ContiCrypt.MFP!MTB it is detected on defender startup
[05.08.21 13:46:11] manuel: 2 stub
[05.08.21 13:46:29] elroy: is it cobalt?
[05.08.21 13:46:56] manuel: Yes cobalt shellcode
[05.08.21 13:47:18] elroy: Maybe try it not as a shellcode, but as a dll or exe ? Is there such possibility?
[05.08.21 13:47:35] elroy: Just an active crypto detector is unlikely to fix
[05.08.21 13:47:43] manuel: no, they're giving me a shellcode.
[05.08.21 13:47:59] manuel: normal ehe worked fine, but there are 9 static detects
[05.08.21 13:48:27] elroy: Let me try to glue it on
[05.08.21 13:48:44] manuel: okay
[05.08.21 13:58:43] elroy: Put it on tab one
[05.08.21 13:59:12] manuel: Cvjnh.
[05.08.21 13:59:14] manuel: Looking
[05.08.21 14:02:21] manuel: Def demolishes after renaming to ehe - HackTool:Win64/CobaltStrike.B
[05.08.21 14:02:44] elroy: So the detection on the shellcode, it's unlikely to be able to crypt...
[05.08.21 14:04:15] manuel: which stack? 4 was running fine without detection
[05.08.21 14:04:34] manuel: Only he has dirty statics
[05.08.21 14:05:38] elroy: It's not by stub, it's infected by shellcode exe... Shellcode obfuscated.
[05.08.21 14:06:16] manuel: I see.
[05.08.21 14:07:07] elroy: there must be an accident with the 4th stub... you have to go to stanton then
[05.08.21 14:07:24] elroy: Maybe he won't have a detec
[05.08.21 14:07:45] manuel: Okay, I'll text him
[05.08.21 14:08:16] manuel: 1 eche is well encrypted by 2 stub. Checked for launch, too, all clear.
[05.08.21 14:08:19] manuel: Why so?
[05.08.21 14:08:54] elroy: I cleaned the second crypto the other day
[05.08.21 14:09:09] manuel: Yes, it worked yesterday
[05.08.21 14:09:47] elroy: I found how to clean avast + aug. updated everything in the evening
[05.08.21 14:10:14] elroy: there cobalt crept me profiles, interesting by the way, first cobalt creeper creeped clean)
[05.08.21 14:11:23] manuel: I was not given sources for test yet
[05.08.21 14:13:47] elroy: Okay) Then don't forget about it, please, I'll let the guys make profiles for cobalt if it works
[05.08.21 14:14:15] manuel: Okay.

[18.08.21 12:27:21] elroy: Say, can I ask one of the testers to test the software? The task is simple, run a couple of exe and wait until it crashes or at least works for 30 minutes.
[18.08.21 12:27:38] manuel: Yes.
[18.08.21 12:27:50] manuel: What do you want to test on?

[8/23/221 11:26:53] elroy: One more thing, you tested the build from elijah, but he's not here today. He'll be there tomorrow. I can request a build from another coder. Is that not a problem?
[23.08.21 11:27:15] manuel: no problem.
[23.08.21 11:27:20] manuel: will there be one from royal?

[08.23.21 11:28:00] manuel: Okay. I'll know.
[23.08.21 11:28:01] elroy: Or if you need royal, from him

[23.08.21 11:28:24] manuel: No difference so far. Ideally, of course, then try all three.

[25.08.21 08:21:30] elroy: x64 ?
[25.08.21:21:38] manuel: Yes.
[25.08.21 08:21:57] elroy: Do you need exactly new build or just crypto?)
[25.08.21 08:22:03] manuel: Just a crypt
[25.08.21 08:22:06] manuel: Tests.
[25.08.21 08:41:38] elroy: Wild has the source, it will be after 12.00, probably easier to reorder the build, but from a different coder.
[25.08.21 08:41:54] elroy: Should we wait for wild or order by new ?
[25.08.21 08:41:59] elroy: Here he is)

[27.08.21 11:18:28] elroy: Demetrius wrote that he started it, but it did not start, I reported it, so far he is silent.
[27.08.21 11:18:33] elroy: Much work?
[27.08.21 11:19:08] elroy: Let's have a word. I can make it clean with a bk.
[27.08.21 11:19:15] manuel: Only the dll locker for now
[27.08.21 11:19:24] elroy: Go ahead)
[27.08.21 11:19:37] manuel: Send or upload?
[27.08.21 11:19:45] elroy: Put it on the panel
[27.08.21 11:20:08] manuel: which tab?
[27.08.21 11:20:15] elroy: One
[27.08.21 11:45:42] elroy: I don't see the file yet.
[27.08.21 11:45:57] manuel: repeat
[27.08.21 11:46:05] elroy: If anything, I don't see the file yet
[27.08.21 11:46:21] manuel: waiting for re-downloaded file with 0 volume

[27.08.21 12:22:48] elroy: Done, you can check
[27.08.21 12:22:58] manuel: checking
[27.08.21 12:23:16] elroy: demetris says jenkins is working
[27.08.21 12:23:55] manuel: Yes, it's working! Hooray!
[01.09.21 17:20:35] manuel: manuel: Prviet. I can't encrypt shellcode in eche 64 all stubs are dirty. And what is not dirty - it detects on startup
[01.09.21 17:20:49] manuel: Help me, please.
[01.09.21 17:22:23] elroy: Does it detect on startup?
[01.09.21 17:22:28] elroy: Greetings.
[01.09.21 17:22:43] elroy: Try crypter 10
[01.09.21 17:22:48] manuel: Yes. 6 and 7 cryptor sichts on static but detekts bazar loader
[01.09.21 17:23:15] manuel: it's not on ehe 64. it's on doo 64
[01.09.21 17:23:27] manuel: 2 kryptor purely for startup and dirty statics
[01.09.21 17:23:39] manuel: 10 crypto p only on dll 64
[01.09.21 17:24:18] elroy: There could be a problem in the shellcode itself, it's detected by AB, right? It's just that for the shellcode to work, it has to be placed in memory. And as soon as we place it, the shellcode catches AB. There's no way around it, you need a clean shellcode.
[01.09.21 17:24:33] elroy: Send it to me, I'll script it.
[01.09.21 17:24:48] manuel: Why on 2 stub do not detect?
[01.09.21 17:25:06] elroy: It can't be.)
[01.09.21 17:25:06] manuel: there is a lot. i think i got a clean 2 stb
[01.09.21 17:25:12] manuel: try to do it in batches
[01.09.21 17:25:20] manuel: that's right ac)
[01.09.21 17:25:24] elroy: Skip it, maybe I'll make a clean one
[01.09.21 17:25:29] elroy: Or tell me the file
[01.09.21 17:25:31] manuel: now.
[01.09.21 17:25:50] manuel: in one yes?
[01.09.21 17:26:14] manuel: uploaded to one
[01.09.21 17:26:20] manuel: 2 files
[01.09.21 17:39:44] elroy: Done, there are 4 files, two of one and two of the other, I didn't look at the detects. All 4 are exe.
[01.09.21 17:40:38] manuel: I'll take a look at the statics. Can I upload more?
[01.09.21 17:40:57] elroy: All of them.)
[01.09.21 17:41:03] elroy: Just answer your question))
[01.09.21 17:41:10] manuel: ehe per krypt])
[01.09.21 17:41:15] manuel: from other shellcodes
[01.09.21 17:41:28] elroy: Ah, come on.
[01.09.21 17:42:32] manuel: I uploaded 3 more files.
[01.09.21 17:42:55] elroy: how to crypto? shellcode 64 or 32 ?
[01.09.21 17:43:07] manuel: shellcode - ephe 64
[01.09.21 17:43:16] manuel: like those 2 before.
[01.09.21 17:43:21] elroy: ok
[01.09.21 17:43:34] elroy: and payload is the same?
[01.09.21 17:43:41] manuel: yeah the same ephe 64
[01.09.21 17:58:00] elroy: Man, all over the place...
[01.09.21 17:58:14] manuel: 9 detects...
[01.09.21 18:00:22] elroy: I'll try again
[01.09.21 18:01:21] manuel: Yeah.
[01.09.21 18:09:36] manuel: Listen, I scanned it on avcequez.
[01.09.21 18:09:36] manuel: https://avcheck.net/id/ZDOBr4gcmcoA
[01.09.21 18:09:43] manuel: There's only two dets
[01.09.21 18:16:17] elroy: Strange
[01.09.21 18:16:22] elroy: Fresh or what?
[01.09.21 18:16:56] manuel: And on dincekai - 9
[01.09.21 18:16:57] manuel: https://avcheck.net/id/DSygGi85wudi
[01.09.21 18:17:00] elroy: I'll make crypts on another machine)
[01.09.21 18:17:03] manuel: This is from the build machine
[01.09.21 18:45:35] manuel: I built clean executables on the build machine, not including payload
[01.09.21 18:46:03] elroy: Cool
[01.09.21 18:46:08] elroy: Second cryptor?
[01.09.21 18:46:17] elroy: I'm just trying out a pyload right now.
[01.09.21 18:46:24] manuel: Yeah, I've been crypting 7 grand in a batch
[01.09.21 18:46:53] manuel: And he's all set
[01.09.21 18:46:59] manuel: he's good to go with the pack too
[01.09.21 18:47:18] manuel: You have to clean the stubs on shellcodes 64 eche and dll. They are most frequent in work now.
[01.09.21 18:47:23] manuel: me
[01.09.21 18:47:37] elroy: clever crypto wrote, it regenerates itself)
[01.09.21 18:47:57] manuel: yeah cool!
[02.09.21 07:30:18] manuel: Prvieth.
[02.09.21 07:30:31] manuel: Yesterday near the end 7 stub for dll codes died.
[02.09.21 07:31:28] elroy: Dead as in no longer crypting?
[02.09.21 07:31:35] elroy: Hello.
[02.09.21 07:31:37] manuel: 10 stub. I never got to build a clean one.
[02.09.21 07:31:47] manuel: Nah.
[02.09.21 07:31:57] manuel: made 10 by stub
[02.09.21 07:32:20] manuel: I need some stub for the eche today. The customer asked to make the crypts by 15.
[02.09.21 07:32:40] elroy: shellcode 64 exe
[02.09.21 07:32:45] elroy: Yes?
[02.09.21 07:32:48] manuel: Yes.
[02.09.21 07:33:01] elroy: payload.bin file ?
[02.09.21 07:33:06] manuel: Yes.
[02.09.21 07:33:22] elroy: I see. Zaimus, I'll give the guys a little more work.
[02.09.21 07:33:30] manuel: Thank you.)
[02.09.21 07:33:51] manuel: 10 stub on dll is good. Small size does and clean. I hope it'll last till monday.
[02.09.21 07:34:25] elroy: Maybe I can make an exe with it...
[02.09.21 07:34:33] manuel: Maybe
[02.09.21 07:49:47] elroy: Write to dane, he says he's clean, detects only on buildmachine
[02.09.21 07:50:11] manuel: He's got detects
[02.09.21 07:50:22] manuel: I'll check his crypt
[02.09.21 08:16:08] elroy: dane:
```
Made some shellcode crypts in the panel. Clean ones. Let them try crypting. If anything, - I'm here )))
```
[02.09.21 08:16:31] manuel: Yeah. I'll update the test vm and check it out.
[02.09.21 08:16:41] elroy: ok.
[02.09.21 09:48:59] manuel: Denis has a vakatak detection.
[02.09.21 09:49:05] manuel: after unpacking.
[02.09.21 09:49:11] manuel: What else can you do with an exe?
[02.09.21 09:50:31] elroy: allen can probably do it manually, just spoke with him
[02.09.21 09:50:35] elroy: Write him
[02.09.21 09:50:44] manuel: ok
[02.09.21 10:10:14] manuel: It's strange... gave raw shellcode and it is not recognized by the build machine as shellcode
[02.09.21 10:10:29] manuel: Can you help me?
[02.09.21 10:10:52] elroy: Looks like it's not a shellcode since it's not recognized)
[02.09.21 10:11:01] elroy: Which file?
[02.09.21 10:11:02] manuel: <mont@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> raw
[02.09.21 10:11:07] manuel: I'll upload it
[02.09.21 10:11:39] manuel: beacon.bin filled
[02.09.21 10:11:56] manuel: into One
[02.09.21 10:12:56] elroy: This is not shellcode, this is pure dll.
If you need it, you can crypt it as a shellcode, but it won't work.
[02.09.21 10:13:27] manuel: Can you make an executable out of it?
[02.09.21 10:13:32] manuel: Or just a dll?
[02.09.21 10:14:07] manuel: Stubami cobalt?
[02.09.21 10:14:21] manuel: DLL functions:
ReflectiveLoader
What does this mean?
[02.09.21 10:15:18] elroy: dll->exe, you have to choose payload type rundll, select stub exe_..., and in the field write ReflectiveLoader (or click on the word, it will appear in the field.
[02.09.21 10:15:46] elroy: >What does this mean?
It means it's a dll and it has an input point ReflectiveLoader
[02.09.21 10:16:04] manuel: Oh, I see. And how to crypt the dll?
[02.09.21 10:16:07] elroy: Like auto-loading dll
[02.09.21 10:16:17] elroy: you have to choose payload type rundll, choose stub exe_..., and in the field write ReflectiveLoader (or click on the word, it will appear in the field.
[02.09.21 10:16:31] elroy: It will crypt in exe
[02.09.21 10:17:09] elroy: You can also select generic, exe, you can probably crypt it anyway
[02.09.21 10:17:23] manuel: Okay.
[02.09.21 10:17:36] elroy: Try generic first
[02.09.21 10:17:49] elroy: If it doesn't work, then rundll
[02.09.21 10:17:58] manuel: Okay.
[02.09.21 10:53:14] manuel: mont@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> is it coba?
[13:47:11] <bentley> Yes koba.
[13:47:18] <mont@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> thanks
[13:50:09] <mont@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> how to run a dll? without entripoint?
[13:50:29] <bentley> It wasn't a shellcode but a dll. It has a ReflectiveLoader point.
[13:50:36] <bentley> To run with it.
[13:52:36] <mont@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> it was atax-pekageswindsecutable stageles - rab
[13:52:43] <mont@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> no knock
[02.09.21 10:53:18] manuel: this is what he wrote
[02.09.21 10:53:36] manuel: crypted dll with this point ReflectiveLoader
[02.09.21 10:54:17] manuel: dll_rundll_crypter 6 - ReflectiveLoader and exe_rundll_crypter2 - ReflectiveLoader
[02.09.21 10:55:13] manuel: [13:54:05] <bentley> and the exe?
[13:54:50] <mont@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> both
[13:54:59] <mont@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion> appears in processes and disappears after 3 sec
[02.09.21 11:05:06] elroy: Crypt with exe_generic_crypter6 profile
[02.09.21 11:06:35] elroy: If it doesn't work, use exe_rundll_crypter6 profile and put ReflectiveLoader into field
[02.09.21 11:06:41] manuel: ok.
[02.09.21 11:08:28] elroy: Or let rabbi throw it off...
[02.09.21 11:08:51] manuel: Yes he skunked silkcod. Did
[02.09.21 11:09:26] elroy: It's some kind of crypt or something else, which is started by reflexive loader. I can't guarantee that it can even run crypto.
[02.09.21 11:09:42] elroy: Shellcode doesn't work either?
[02.09.21 11:10:21] manuel: I'm about to find out.

[09.09.21 09:29:47] manuel: Can you clean it? There's only your stub can take some of the grids
[09.09.21 09:30:15] manuel: No other stubs
[09.09.21 09:30:36] elroy: I'm glad I did.)
It'll work, I'm working on it. As long as the gap in the tunnel has closed...

[09.09.21 09:31:11] manuel: But 32 is rarely asked for
[09.09.21 09:31:26] elroy: So what about the dll?

[15.09.21 08:37:47] elroy: Greetings. It's on cleanup, it will take time, the emulation detection has gone. The cleanup requires it to be redone (prewritten), that will take time. I tried doing through 2022 studio yesterday, managed to make clean bk's. Let me try it.
[15.09.21 08:38:14] manuel: Is it an Eche or a dll?
[15.09.21 08:38:16] elroy: If anything, from 16 to 30 write basil, he will manually script 2022 studio)

[15.09.21 12:47:08] elroy: I don't think cobalt strike will be able to stop it.
[15.09.21 12:47:23] manuel: Hmm...
[15.09.21 12:47:28] elroy: stanton has an interesting shellcode trick

[05.11.21 11:13:13] manuel: Ok, I'll check my performance without cloud...
[05.11.21 11:33:50] manuel: Build - ok take it to work.
[05.11.21 11:35:53] elroy: There's more
[05.11.21 11:36:48] manuel: Yeah.
[05.11.21 11:58:55] elroy: There's 4 more assemblies. Doing the rest?
[05.11.21 11:59:20] manuel: Yes, everything will go into business today.
[05.11.21 11:59:34] elroy: Okay, doing the rest.
[05.11.21 11:59:39] elroy: Four is enough.
[05.11.21 11:59:40] elroy: ?
[05.11.21 11:59:56] manuel: Yeah.
[05.11.21 15:22:34] elroy: All 4 for 4 ready
[16.11.21 13:12:18] elroy: Greetings.
[16.11.21 13:12:36] manuel: Hello.
[16.11.21 13:13:11] elroy: Tell me, what are the crypto assemblies now for that Collin customer who is allocated a reserve ?
[16.11.21 13:13:41] manuel: That's what we crypt
[16.11.21 13:13:45] manuel: 5 stabo bk
[16.11.21 13:14:09] elroy: And the fifth stub is always clean?
[16.11.21 13:14:26] elroy: exactly that profile
[11/16/21 13:14:45] manuel: Yes, it's clean so far. Haven't been working yet.
[16.11.21 13:14:49] manuel: Not dirty.
[16.11.21 13:14:55] manuel: By the way, who should I write to about cleaning?
[16.11.21 13:15:10] elroy: It's a stub orval
[16.11.21 13:15:21] manuel: Got it.
[16.11.21 13:16:12] elroy: I once had collin write me that the second stub doesn't work, I localized there. If you get a messy fifth, write, I'll manually do
[16.11.21 13:16:37] manuel: Vj;yj dnjhsv rhbgnjdfnm&
[16.11.21 13:16:42] manuel: Can you crypt the second one?
[16.11.21 13:16:54] manuel: Or is it only dedicated for this client?
[16.11.21 13:16:56] elroy: On the fifth stub svakatak, again. Didn't show up on the bk yet?
[16.11.21 13:17:14] manuel: I'll check it out. Yesterday it was clean.
[16.11.21 13:17:55] elroy: You can use the second one on the build-machine. Under the needs highlighted that I have manually second (I just technically can not add it to the buildmachine yet)
[16.11.21 15:22:20] manuel: Another question. Can we give out 2000 crypto dlls for example?
[16.11.21 15:23:22] elroy: I need to measure how many one is made and count.
[16.11.21 15:25:09] elroy: It depends on what kind of crypto...
For example.
3 minutes * 2000 / 6 threads = 1000 minutes = 17 hours (approximately)
[16.11.21 15:25:37] elroy: Unless I give it to crypto coders, distribute
[16.11.21 15:25:50] elroy: I mean, technically it's possible, yes, but the time has to be calculated
[16.11.21 15:26:22] manuel: 17 hours... How will the coders do it?
[16.11.21 15:27:07] elroy: Who knows how... For example, if I fall out, I wrote a script, the build will be called automatically... Just the laptop will warm up a little bit)
[16.11.21 15:27:25] elroy: And hugo for example will do months
[16.11.21 15:27:29] elroy: Within a year
[16.11.21 15:28:06] elroy: We can rent a server additionally
[16.11.21 15:28:09] elroy: Rare there
[16.11.21 15:28:49] manuel: How many 2k krypts will you build?
[16.11.21 15:29:06] elroy: If it's a persistent task, you can docker and cloud 1000 machines in a few minutes, pay for it....
[16.11.21 15:29:33] manuel: How much will you pay if the task will be constant?
[16.11.21 15:29:44] elroy: I have to count, but last time I did a series, it took a long time. Several minutes for 1 build.
[16.11.21 15:30:33] elroy: I can't say right away, it depends on crypto algorithms and prices of calculations... Well, it'll be too expensive, it's easier to rent some servers and wait for a few hours
[16.11.21 15:30:55] manuel: well, 2-3 hours can wait.
[16.11.21 15:31:15] manuel: It's just a new client and he wants to know if it's possible to make so many crypts
[16.11.21 15:31:47] elroy: The answer is
It is technically possible, but you have to prepare in advance.
[16.11.21 15:31:52] elroy: This also depends on cryptor
[16.11.21 15:31:58] elroy: You should get ready in short]
[16.11.21 15:32:18] manuel: I see.)
[16.11.21 15:32:34] manuel: How much time to prepare if we do it
[16.11.21 15:36:03] elroy: It depends on which way, from a couple of days and more if we rent servers. I.e. just take the server and see the performance, you can give an answer. The server a couple of days to prepare.
If you prepare for the docker, more. You have to prepare it and deploy it, it will take a month or more.
[16.11.21 15:36:43] manuel: Got it.
[16.11.21 15:37:03] manuel: Then he's looking at a test crypt and if everything is okay I can offer these conditions.
[16.11.21 15:37:16] elroy: But you can throw a docker or vps on the cloud, there in parallel and 200k you can, as much as you want, if only money) But it takes a lot of money)
[16.11.21 15:37:22] elroy: Okay.)
[16.11.21 15:37:42] manuel: How much is a lot?
[16.11.21 15:37:53] elroy: Thousands of dollars for the build.
[16.11.21 15:37:53] manuel: for 2 cryptos, how much would it cost to go in?
[16.11.21 15:38:06] elroy: I.e. per batch
[16.11.21 15:38:10] manuel: 2,000 crypts
[16.11.21 15:38:50] elroy: One build will create 2,000 crypts in 5 minutes. It will cost anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars (by eye, because the figure floats a lot, a lot of factors).
[16.11.21 15:39:34] elroy: There's another way to go, you can develop crypter specifically for this
[16.11.21 15:39:36] manuel: Hundreds of dollars is okay.)
[16.11.21 15:40:06] elroy: You can handle batches on normal hardware, but you need time to develop it, at least 1 month
[16.11.21 15:41:51] manuel: Got it.
[16.11.21 15:44:24] elroy: You can still give out a lot of similar crypts.
I.e. they won't be unique in terms of code, they'll only differ in hashes (fuzzy ones too).
You make one build with empty spaces specially allocated for garbage. Such a sieve. Then the sieve is filled. This will take a few minutes or so, up to 10 minutes. The crypts will be different, they will pass. But in the extended analysis, they will be as one. And there is a risk that if one is burned by signatures, all the others will be burned.
[16.11.21 15:45:10] manuel: This is what they used to have:
[16.11.21 15:45:21] manuel: ``
 that's how the ret was crypting
he was already laying it down in the crypt
and his toolzine script had already changed it
that's kinda how it happened
change import,rich,code,datatime,heade,checksum
when you change it it says it's fixing that data

```
[16.11.21 15:45:37] manuel: Can we implement something similar?
[16.11.21 15:47:28] elroy: I mean it will be imported, but it won't work (imported functions), it's probably not needed in crypto).
code - it is not clear what exactly was changed here.
[16.11.21 15:48:01] elroy: Yes, such crypto can be done. But you also need time to prepare.
[16.11.21 15:48:46] manuel: Will it be possible to make a huge amount of them? And how much time will it take?
[16.11.21 15:50:04] elroy: Yes, you can make a huge amount. Make one unique crypt, then patch copies. Well, by the look of it, 1 thousand in 5 minutes.
[16.11.21 15:50:42] manuel: awesome!
[16.11.21 15:51:03] elroy: quality of crypts is just different
[16.11.21 15:51:14] manuel: It's worse quality, right?
[16.11.21 15:51:40] elroy: Yes. As I said, there's a risk that one batch will fly away after the other
[16.11.21 15:52:01] manuel: I see.
[11/16/21 15:53:11] elroy: Crypter 2 and 8 and others have the ability to generate code, i.e. code positions in the file for each build are made unique. But even these stray well too... (that's why we clean it, and we don't have time).
[16.11.21 15:53:25] manuel: yeah
[16.11.21 15:54:11] elroy: And if you just patch, the code won't change its place, i.e. it's the same as all the others, but the hashes will just be different... And the signatures will stay in place if the signature is highlighted not on the patched fragment
[16.11.21 15:54:26] elroy: But it's much faster)
[16.11.21 15:54:32] manuel: Yeah.)
[16.11.21 15:55:42] elroy: By the way, you can make a trial batch of 1000 pieces, for example, those and those. For the sake of the test, you can wait 10 hours. Load up and see which survive better)).
[16.11.21 15:56:08] manuel: Okay, let's talk).
[16.11.21 15:56:18] manuel: you can put on the build for the night ))
[16.11.21 15:56:38] elroy: Night is occupied by autotests.
[16.11.21 15:56:47] elroy: Or you can put it on my laptop.)
[18.11.21 08:48:33] manuel: Prviet, once again. Need 1 more stub for crypta shk - dll64. There's 6 dane in the works right now cleaning it up all the time as far as I know. Need a doubler, because almost half of the crypts I do just by this stub.
[18.11.21 08:48:45] manuel: 4 3 7 dirty
[18.11.21 08:49:17] elroy: Greetings. I'll take note of it, think it over, add it.
[11/18/21 08:49:25] manuel: Thank you.
[22.11.21 14:38:01] manuel: Hi. Tell me, can someone crypt eche trik?
[22.11.21 14:38:21] elroy: Crypter 8?
[22.11.21 14:38:29] elroy: Hello.
[22.11.21 14:39:58] manuel: There's a set
[22.11.21 14:39:59] manuel: https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/31d432fcfcf5a53c8fd2ed2c6860127f
[22.11.21 14:42:32] elroy: What file?
[22.11.21 14:44:27] manuel: cbg1.bin d fyrhbgntl
[22.11.21 14:44:31] manuel: in the briefcase
[22.11.21 14:46:17] elroy: I'll try to encrypt it myself now
[22.11.21 14:46:30] elroy: Have you tried crypter 3?
[22.11.21 14:47:08] manuel: ofc gjghj,e.
[22.11.21 14:47:12] manuel: I'll give it a try.
[22.11.21 14:47:19] manuel: Just on autotest they are all dirty
[22.11.21 15:11:29] manuel: on 3 stub Norton
[22.11.21 15:11:30] manuel: https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/c526d52e0cbce43640f4c9c14b8b2e2f
[22.11.21 15:13:04] elroy: Can't make it clean yet. It takes 1-2 hours to deploy the software
[22.11.21 15:13:11] elroy: To do?
[22.11.21 15:13:34] manuel: Sec
[22.11.21 15:14:05] manuel: Come on.
[22.11.21 15:14:12] elroy: okay.
[22.11.21 15:56:04] elroy: Tab One, top file
[22.11.21 16:01:59] manuel: Yeah, I'm looking.
[11/22/11/21 16:18:24] manuel: Okay. I'm running krypt. WerFault.exe process comes up from and the crypt's exe and crashes after 10 seconds of running.
[22.11.21 16:18:33] manuel: Same on 8 stub
[22.11.21 16:19:13] manuel: I managed to make a clean exe and it crashed with WerFault.exe too
[22.11.21 16:19:41] elroy: Maybe that's it then...
[22.11.21 16:21:00] elroy: I'll make another one with one code fragment edit
[22.11.21 16:27:16] elroy: Try a new one.
[22.11.21 16:27:25] elroy: There's a link to dincek
[22.11.21 16:27:44] manuel: Yeah, I'm looking.
[22.11.21 16:32:29] manuel: Same story
[22.11.21 16:33:01] elroy: Then it's the source
[22.11.21 16:33:22] manuel: I'll check it now.
[22.11.21 16:39:30] manuel: The source code worked. Process wemgr.exe is up.
[22.11.21 16:39:59] elroy: Wait.
[11/22/221 16:40:03] elroy: And you test it on a farm?
[22.11.21 16:40:11] elroy: On proxmos?
[22.11.21 16:40:14] manuel: No, on my vm.
[22.11.21 16:40:21] manuel: On my computer
[22.11.21 16:40:35] elroy: Virtual box or vmvare?
[22.11.21 16:41:12] elroy: Let's check something so I know if this is the case or not)
[22.11.21 16:41:25] manuel: Vmvare
[22.11.21 16:41:27] manuel: Come on))
[22.11.21 16:42:24] elroy: Tab One flick up
[22.11.21 16:42:30] manuel: yeah
[22.11.21 16:42:51] elroy: Run it on your own, there will be two messages. The second one will contain success or failed
[22.11.21 16:43:26] manuel: okay.
[22.11.21 16:46:46] manuel: success
[11/22/221 16:47:10] elroy: Then that's not it. Alas, I don't know what it is then...
[22.11.21 16:47:55] manuel: Workflow goes up about 1 minute after I start the file
[22.11.21 16:48:13] elroy: Then crypt works
[22.11.21 16:48:43] manuel: so maybe I turned it off early?
[22.11.21 16:48:48] manuel: Let me try again
[11/22/11/21 16:49:00] elroy: Process or file crashes?)
[22.11.21 16:49:18] manuel: The process and the executable
[22.11.21 16:49:24] manuel: krypt
[22.11.21 16:50:52] elroy: I updated crypto 8 on the panel, order a logged source from the coders, send them the log... Without that, you can't tell what's there.
[22.11.21 16:51:17] manuel: Who do I order from?
[22.11.21 16:51:23] manuel: Got the source code.
[22.11.21 16:51:29] elroy: Trick coders.
[22.11.21 17:01:37] manuel: I also ran into a problem. I used rundll32 - dll_rundll_crypter11
[22.11.21 17:01:47] manuel: 3 dlls
[22.11.21 17:01:53] manuel: 2 work, 3 don't
[22.11.21 17:02:09] manuel: 3 dlls have the same WerFault error
[22.11.21 17:02:21] manuel: The first 2 dlls worked fine
[22.11.21 17:03:02] elroy: Come on, let's check something else.)
[22.11.21 17:03:13] manuel: Come on ))
[22.11.21 17:03:18] elroy: I'll do another trick.
[22.11.21 17:07:15] elroy: There's a file on the One tab
[22.11.21 17:08:27] manuel: Yeah.
[11/22/221 17:21:29] manuel: Everything works!!! Perfect!
[22.11.21 17:22:23] elroy: Too bad...
[22.11.21 17:22:41] elroy: Is it even clean?
[22.11.21 17:23:37] manuel: Why a pity?
[22.11.21 17:23:41] manuel: Let me check the statics.
[22.11.21 17:23:44] manuel: No detects.
[22.11.21 17:23:47] manuel: On startup
[22.11.21 17:24:16] elroy: Too bad because it's almost naked
[22.11.21 17:24:22] elroy: So the alternator's screwed up.
[11/22/21/221 17:24:26] elroy: That's why it's terrible.
[22.11.21 17:24:43] elroy: I'll update on build machine
[22.11.21 17:29:29] manuel: https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/834eda79012ec6cc30381c66a6f7f13e
[22.11.21 17:29:33] manuel: norton on static
[22.11.21 17:29:58] elroy: Because it's bare....
[22.11.21 17:30:31] elroy: I'll make some different ones, check it then, choose the right one
[22.11.21 17:30:38] manuel: yeah ok
[22.11.21 17:47:24] elroy: added 5 files, try it
[22.11.21 17:48:56] manuel: Yeah.
[22.11.21 18:00:52] manuel: 15 - detection to run: Trojan:Win32/Sabsik.FL.A!ml
[11/22/11/21 18:09:55] elroy: Did you manage to run at least one?
[11/22/21/221 18:10:15] manuel: Checking further.
[22.11.21 18:29:36] manuel: 2 consecutive wacktacs roll over
[22.11.21 18:29:50] manuel: probably already started knocking on the HQ
[22.11.21 18:30:00] elroy: )
[22.11.21 18:30:06] elroy: Make some more crypto?
[22.11.21 18:30:18] manuel: I have 2 more left ))
[22.11.21 18:30:24] manuel: Do it if you don't mind
[11/22/221 18:30:28] elroy: okay.
[11/23/221 10:24:56] manuel: Hey.
[11/23/11/21 10:25:05] manuel: You want me to finish the crypt eche trike?
[23.11.21 10:25:31] manuel: Yesterday I tested on new vm still vakatak
[11/23/11/21 10:26:18] elroy: Greetings. I can do crypto... But maybe it's not about the crypt, it's about the trick?
[11/23/11/21 10:26:32] elroy: Is it a static vakatak or a post-run vakatak?
[11/23/11/21 10:26:44] manuel: on launch
[11/23/221 10:27:42] elroy: Let's do an experiment. Script trick with all generic exe crypto and just run it. Everywhere vakatak?
[11/23/11/21 10:28:02] elroy: Never mind size, never mind other detects
[11/23/221 10:28:08] elroy: Let's catch the vcatacs
[11/23/11/21 10:28:12] manuel: 8 is normal stub but it doesn't work
[11/23/11/21 10:28:46] elroy: The ones I threw yesterday were all made by the eighth stab
[11/23/221 10:29:10] elroy: Does it work or not?
[11/23/11/21 10:29:13] manuel: strange
[11/23/11/21 10:29:17] elroy: Let's get a vactac
[23.11.21 10:29:23] manuel: just the build machine was clean
[11/23/221 10:29:27] manuel: okay.
[23.11.21 10:30:24] elroy: I can upload to build-machine update with the parameters that were yesterday
[23.11.21 10:31:27] elroy: Repeat message, please, connection was lost
[11/23/11/21 10:32:11] manuel: lfdfq gjghj,etv
[11/23/221 10:32:28] manuel: Let's try
[11/23/11/21 10:32:36] manuel: Will you throw in an update?
[11/23/11/21 10:32:43] elroy: Yes.
[11/23/221 10:37:00] elroy: I did.
[11/23/11/21 15:22:23] manuel: 8 good crypto
[23.11.21 15:22:29] manuel: works and no detects
[23.11.21 15:27:27] elroy: lucky)
[23.11.21 15:27:48] elroy: I'm just experimenting with it, some detects, others
[11/23/11/21 15:50:05] manuel: Probably.)
[25.11.21 08:32:58] manuel: Hi. I can't make dll_rundll_crypter3 crypting.
[25.11.21 08:33:06] manuel: It says failed
[25.11.21 08:33:25] manuel: I was making crypts an hour ago though. Please help me.
[25.11.21 08:33:40] elroy: Greetings. Let me see what's up.
[25.11.21 09:28:05] elroy: The third crypter works. The error is because the source exports a function with a standard name, in this case DllGetClassObject. Crypter 3 does not support it.

[25.11.21 09:32:19] manuel: If you want to make a crypt withMongol point
[25.11.21 09:33:03] elroy: Allen will fix it, but it's not now. The only option here is to use another crypto
[25.11.21 09:33:22] elroy: And what source?
[25.11.21 09:33:26] manuel: Others are dirty judging by autotests
[25.11.21 09:33:43] manuel: dll cbbt there are 12 of them to crypt
[25.11.21 09:34:35] elroy: you can write to allen, maybe he can do it manually

[25.11.21 11:18:55] manuel: I remember, but I can't find it at home
[25.11.21 11:19:07] elroy: Here's an idea, take the source code, rename these standard functions in it, for example DllGetClassObject into DllGetClassObje34, crypt it, and then in your crypto rename it back with the same utility
[25.11.21 11:20:23] manuel: Will it work?
[25.11.21 11:20:27] manuel: After that?
[25.11.21 11:20:30] manuel: Crypt dll
[25.11.21 11:21:02] elroy: After that, it will. But there are doubts that it will even work with 3 crypto
[25.11.21 11:21:28] elroy: You should try it, as usual.)
[25.11.21 11:21:42] manuel: Yeah
[25.11.21 11:21:52] manuel: send me the utility please, I'll do it
[25.11.21 11:21:59] manuel: And tell me what and how to rename.)

[29.11.21 07:59:58] manuel: I think so.
[29.11.21 07:59:58] elroy: We can also reproduce with the utility, but we need to prepare our stubs for it. You can just put it on the build on the server and let it build.
[29.11.21 08:00:21] manuel: Better to put it on the build, right? Would it be more qualitative?
[29.11.21 08:00:33] elroy: And qualitatively and long)
[29.11.21 08:00:50] manuel: It's all about quality.
[29.11.21 08:00:53] manuel: And how long?
[29.11.21 08:01:00] elroy: He drops the source code and how much time do we have?
[29.11.21 08:01:16] elroy: It depends on the server
[29.11.21 08:01:38] manuel: Yes there is not clear he is dealing with the source code.
[29.11.21 08:01:46] elroy: Skip his source, I will measure how much my laptop will build, I will give a comparative forecast
[29.11.21 08:01:49] manuel: I did 2-5 hours of 200 builds last time
[29.11.21 08:02:07] elroy: Send me the last source

[29.11.21 08:14:49] manuel: 3 and 11
[29.11.21 08:14:52] manuel: rundkk32
[29.11.21 08:14:57] manuel: rundll32
[29.11.21 08:17:00] elroy: I think I can add a profile for a build of 100 or 1000. I'll just check the time.
[29.11.21 08:18:24] manuel: +
[29.11.21 11:39:08] elroy: 68 minutes for 100 crypto 3
[29.11.21 11:39:52] elroy: If the build goes in one thread.
Theoretically, you can expand to 8 or 10 threads.
[29.11.21 11:40:17] manuel: How to do it? And how much does it cost?
[29.11.21 11:40:39] elroy: It will take our whole server for that time (for 1 hour)
[29.11.21 11:40:53] elroy: Let me see if it does it in parallel
[29.11.21 11:41:01] manuel: Is there any period of time when server is busy?
[29.11.21 11:41:14] manuel: To run so many crypts during that time
[29.11.21 11:41:44] elroy: From 3 am to 7 or until 10 am (as it turns out) autobuilds work.
[29.11.21 11:42:01] elroy: Then from 10 to 11 no one usually works)
[29.11.21 11:42:14] elroy: That's a lot of builds for that time today
[29.11.21 11:43:37] manuel: Yes, I did it.)
[29.11.21 11:45:49] elroy: I'm going to check the parallelism of the builds for 10 threads now.
And in general, we've done profiles
dll_rundll_crypter3_pack100
dll_rundll_crypter100_pack100
They do 100 builds at a time, they return as a dll, but it's an archive, you download and change the .dll extension to .7z
You install 10 copies, you get 1 thousand (10 archives of 100).
Don't do it yet, I'll check the parallelism and report back.
[29.11.21 11:47:48] manuel: I got it!
[29.11.21 11:47:48] manuel: Great!!!
[29.11.21 12:09:57] elroy: For crypter 3 I got 50 pcs in 12 minutes, with parallel build of 5 archives of 10.
[29.11.21 12:12:26] elroy: I saw no errors, it should work.
I've expanded the number of builders to 12, i.e. if you put 10 archives into 100, there are still 2 builders just in case. I hope the resources will be enough, but if not - we'll see, fix, increase)

[29.11.21 12:13:51] manuel: Great!
[29.11.21 15:28:52] manuel: And one more request.
[29.11.21 15:29:09] manuel: Leo's stubs have increased the load. So far, I'm only doing crypts with 6 stubs.
[29.11.21 15:29:24] manuel: I need 1-2 more stubs to clean up for lowers and Leo bots
[29.11.21 15:29:40] manuel: 5 was good and 7 too.
[29.11.21 15:29:54] manuel: Only now a slightly different lowader and bot
[29.11.21 15:36:19] elroy: Write again
[29.11.21 15:36:58] manuel: And another request.
Leo's stubs are getting a heavier load. So far, I'm only doing crypts with 6 stubs.
I need 1-2 more stubs to clean up for Leo's lowers and bots.
5 was good and so was 7.
Only now a slightly different lowder and bot
[29.11.21 15:37:30] elroy: Why is it different?
[29.11.21 15:37:56] elroy: Take a crap, don't write that.
[29.11.21 15:39:06] manuel: Something changed there last time
[29.11.21 15:39:41] elroy: You should elaborate on this point.)
[29.11.21 15:39:55] elroy: Write down 5 and 7 just check the functionality
[29.11.21 15:40:00] manuel: Okay.
[29.11.21 15:40:04] elroy: If it's okay, we'll tighten the rest
[29.11.21 15:40:05] manuel: 5 is not showing.
[29.11.21 15:40:19] elroy: Toga 7
[29.11.21 15:40:41] elroy: Collin's customer hasn't written yet?
[29.11.21 15:40:52] elroy: It's just that for him we keep two cryptors for a month
[29.11.21 15:41:39] manuel: I wrote him it is not clear what and how the work will be.
[29.11.21 15:42:01] manuel: I think it's possible to run a stub. And if it matures, we'll privatize it again.
[29.11.21 15:42:56] elroy: Okay, we need to coordinate with collin` then, so he was aware of it. Then one stub of the two can be released.
[29.11.21 15:43:42] elroy: I'll update crypter2, let it work, and then we'll find (or not) additional cryptor when we need it

[03.12.21 11:47:40] manuel: I see.
[03.12.21 11:47:49] manuel: maybe orval will be cleaner
[03.12.21 11:48:20] elroy: So, is it cool if you use both cet and avira on static?
[03.12.21 11:48:29] elroy: It will burn in dynamics
[03.12.21 11:49:04] elroy: More like avast and yeset

[03.12.21 17:22:28] manuel: ``
 i'm not an expert in these things, but i think this load should not be allowed to work, we are working in vain then, the first crypto will fly in
i looked inside loader, it doesn't hide itself at all, even its name is loader.dll
5:20 PM
need to clean up the source code?
5:21 PM
of course
ask elroy, i think he's still here, i could be wrong, i don't know much

```
[03.12.21 17:24:12] elroy: He says correctly. The load will fly in and burn the crypt afterwards.
[03.12.21 17:24:24] elroy: That's the way it is on one side.
[03.12.21 17:24:29] elroy: But there's another side.
[03.12.21 17:24:43] elroy: As rozetka wrote out today in that chat room
[03/12/221 17:25:12] elroy: It's not important that it's clean, it's important that the av that's online is clean.
[03.12.21 17:25:18] elroy: It depends on how one works
[03.12.21 17:25:24] elroy: Who cares what
[03.12.21 17:25:31] elroy: Did they ask you specifically for food?
[03.12.21 17:25:51] manuel: well, yeah, the question is, the outlet knows what kind of food to cook under
[03.12.21 17:25:58] manuel: I was asked for food at the ave
[03.12.21 17:26:05] manuel: and especially nod32
[03.12.21 17:26:34] elroy: Well, it's really illogical to distribute such a thing
[03.12.21 17:26:52] elroy: But maybe they need food on static just for sending file where there is no AV
[03.12.21 17:26:54] elroy: For example
[03.12.21 17:27:06] manuel: quite
[03.12.21 17:27:26] elroy: they take a handful of files and check them on the machine with net, clean, then they copy the files somewhere where there is no AB on the machines anymore.
[03.12.21 17:27:51] elroy: This strategy could be
[03.12.21 17:28:23] elroy: In general, just take into account, if there is a grainy source on static, starting it with AV is useless, all will be spoiled
[03.12.21 17:28:44] elroy: If you need it, let him make a crypt then))
[03.12.21 17:28:45] manuel: Can't you clean it with crypto?
[03.12.21 17:28:54] elroy: Kryptom cleans statics
[03.12.21 17:28:59] manuel: Yes
[12.03.21 17:29:54] elroy: As soon as it's launched somewhere, it will work with dynamics and AV will mark itself that this file is malicious and will leak information into network and then it won't pass through statics. I.e. in this case it's for one run
[03.12.21 17:30:27] elroy: But it happens too .....
[03.12.21 17:30:34] manuel: Yeah.
[03.12.21 17:30:50] elroy: They said you need a crypt, do it...
[06.12.21 07:52:53] manuel: Hi. Will you be able to crypt Leo with stubs?
[06.12.21 08:01:25] elroy: Hello.
[06.12.21 08:02:03] elroy: I can try to make carrol crypto or someone else's. Mine is dirty, need to clean, so far something is not working.

now about the dll loeder that was yesterday
krypt crashed or gave an error if it was run with the command rundll32 loader.dll,DllGetClassObject
and if it was run with
regsvr32 loader.dll
rundll32 loader.dll,DllRegisterServer - then it would crash

I need the loader to be able to run the following commands
regsvr32 loader.dll
rundll32 loader.dll,DllRegisterServer
rundll32 loader.dll,DllGetClassObject
```
[07.12.21 10:25:41] elroy: Loider made with this fix. Let him check it. If it does not work - then it's either in the looder itself, or need to wait for carrol to find out what magic is in
[07.12.21 10:26:37] manuel: ok
[07.12.21 10:35:20] elroy: both files are ready
[07.12.21 10:35:38] manuel: good
[07.12.21 10:36:03] manuel: another question. Can you crypt a 32bit dll into a dll no bigger than 64kb that crypt. Source code is 6kb.
[07.12.21 10:36:32] elroy: no
[07.12.21 10:37:01] manuel: got it
[07.12.21 10:37:03] manuel: thanks
[07.12.21 11:16:39] manuel: everything is fine!

[14.12.21 09:17:18] elroy: Hello. No, it's not working. Bildmachine caught the coder.

[12/14-21 09:17:18] elroy: Hello. No, it's not working. Bildmachine caught the coder.
[12/14/21 09:17:54] manuel: Holy crap!
[12/14/21 09:18:01] manuel: our fault?
[14.12.21 09:18:30] elroy: I don't know. Well, at least the server security wasn't configured.
[14.12.21 09:18:57] manuel: Yeah...
[14.12.21 09:19:10] manuel: So can you crypt 2 stabo Leo loads?
[12/14/221 09:24:40] elroy: With the second stabo? Does it fit and work?
[14.12.21 09:25:00] manuel: yeah it's fine with him yesterday
[14.12.21 09:25:14] manuel: I gave it out along with 6 and it worked fine
[12/14/221 09:25:28] elroy: The problem is, I don't have studio 2022, and it's going through it. It's only on the server. I'll be able to crypt out later, when I put it on...
[14.12.21 09:25:58] manuel: Ok waiting. no one can do it yet
[14.12.21 09:26:05] manuel: Dane doesn't answer ((
[14.12.21 09:27:25] manuel: Another question. On the randomizer. Can we make one for Zeus?
[14.12.21 09:29:04] elroy: We can do it. Tell me, what do you need?)
[14.12.21 09:29:36] elroy: Is this the crap, when one crypt is made and then randomized by software?
[14.12.21 09:32:30] manuel: yeah, like changing some string in the crypt itself to another one.
[14.12.21 09:35:54] elroy: if just a string is changed, it takes 15 minutes to write
[14.12.21 09:36:17] elroy: I thought you had to bypass the fuzzy hash
[14.12.21 09:36:22] elroy: There's just more work then
[12/14/221 09:36:46] manuel: here. What are the options with this technology and how to do it better ?
[14.12.21 09:40:59] elroy: There are three types of rearrangement:
1. full, one crypt in a panel - one thing. bides in some time, a set of crypts takes up a lot of space. - this is the best solution in terms of reliability of crypts.
2. one crypt is made and randomized by a utility, but the crypt is made with pre-prepared "holes". so you can bypass fuzzy hash. This is so average.
3. A file with a string is made and the string is patched. A fuzzy hash will match the files, a crisp one will not. This variant makes sense in practice only if you know for sure that the check is just by hashes, the usual ones. If you apply a fuzzy hash, then all under one comb will go to failure.
[14.12.21 11:25:06] manuel: Tell me, what's stenton's nickname in Toad?

If you specify the option for the crypter, the sieve will be filled with beacons and the file will be output.
You will need to run a utility that patches the beacons.

This will create 1000 copies.
Very important, the original version with beacons shouldn't go anywhere, because the beacons will only create a signature

[20.12.21 09:22:28] elroy: I'll clean it soon, I should start today, I'll probably clean it one of these days.

[20.12.21 10:06:55] elroy: I can't tell if it's dirty or not

[20.12.21 16:29:15] elroy: Let's see:
@allen - on line
@hugo - on line
@stanton - disconnected
@carrol - disconnected
@dane - disconnected (on vacation)
@orval - disconnected
@diego - in progress
@elroy - in the middle of cleaning/repairing a crypto
The answer to the question is @allen or @hugo, since they are on call. If they're clean, they'll crypt, if not, they won't.
[12/21/221 16:29:40] manuel: Ok. I'll knock on it.

you take a dll trike, crypt it, and reproduce it so that each successive file has its own unique hash. After that you look at the metadata of several files. You need to figure out what metadata the files will get when they are generated. After that, you will probably still have to learn how to change the metadata when generating the files to a unique
```
[22.12.21 12:20:40] manuel: A utility like for hashing Leo
[12/22/221 12:23:13] elroy: Please describe the experiment in more detail. What is written doesn't make sense. I can give out right now a utility that changes the rich header in every copy of the dll. But everything else will stay there.

[12/23/221 09:43:12] elroy: otr?
[12/23/221 09:43:39] elroy: I understand the customer outrage...
[12/23/221 09:45:16] elroy: We're in trouble. Yesterday they hacked pledge chat room and posted a ransom message there and leaked all our crypto and source code.
I'm busy rebuilding that team right now. Then we will solve something with the cryptors.
(silver is aware but don't spread the news).
[23.12.21 09:45:47] manuel: Yes, I saw it in that chat.
[23.12.21 09:46:28] elroy: I have a suggestion.
Write a list of profiles you need and what cryptor better to do them (than you usually did).
[23.12.21 09:46:52] elroy: And write in priority what you need first
[12/23/221 09:47:01] elroy: I'm making a schedule.
[12/23/221 09:47:27] elroy: But it won't be quick in the end, we have 2 cryptors on vacation
[12/23/221 09:47:46] manuel: Leo. rundll32 32 and 64, gerenik ehe 32 and 64
[12/23/221 09:47:50] manuel: this is the main thing
[23.12.21 09:48:02] manuel: 1 would crypt of each profile.
[12/23/221 09:48:26] manuel: and also shk - dll64 shk - ehe 64 shk - dll32 shk - ehe 32. That's another 4.
[23.12.21 09:48:54] elroy: there's also bk.
[12/23/221 09:49:07] elroy: and et
[12/23/221 09:49:11] elroy: All are needed...
[12/23/221 09:49:17] elroy: What's the priority?)
[23.12.21 09:49:53] manuel: Leo is the most frequent then shk 64 dll and ehe then randll32
[12/23/221 09:50:59] elroy: contacted allen and hugo, is there anything they can do?
[12/23/221 09:51:08] manuel: Yes they can
[12/23/221 09:51:14] manuel: almost everything + sam still

[12/23/221 17:54:28] elroy: I made a recommended list
[12/23/221 17:54:44] elroy: I made a recommended list
[12/23/221 17:54:50] elroy: Take five minutes?)
[12/23/221 17:55:04] manuel: Sure.
[12/23/221 17:56:56] elroy: Order from hugo.
leo and shellcode with entry point - carrol
exe and rundll does allen
Everything else is orval.
But there's a problem with graifk. It doesn't overlap for everyone.
[23.12.21 17:57:30] elroy: + I'm on a replacement for everyone, but I'm all over the place now... I don't have time
[23.12.21 17:57:53] manuel: Everything is dirty on leo now, and on echo as well
[12/23/221 17:58:12] elroy: This list of directions is just a recommendation. If you drop all profiles at once, no one will clean anything properly, they'll just get overworked and that's it...
[12/23/221 17:58:33] elroy: carrol will clean up leo I gave him this as a priority
[12/23/221 17:58:49] manuel: Okay. Tomorrow already yes?
[12/23/221 17:58:58] elroy: Probably.
[12/23/221 17:59:11] elroy: So far...
[12/23/221 17:59:30] elroy: I'm still pulling up new crypto, there are one/two new ones for exe
[12/23/221 17:59:39] elroy: + learning to clean diego
[12/23/221 18:00:03] manuel: What about stanton? Is he on vacation?
[12/23/221 18:00:28] manuel: He was good at coba and lockers.
[12/23/221 18:00:42] elroy: Yeah, he's grieving. He probably won't be in much working order after his vacation.
[12/23/221 18:01:01] manuel: What happened?
[12/23/221 18:01:16] elroy: He said his son died....

[12/24/21 08:09:40] manuel: It's on Leo.

[12/24/21 08:11:12] manuel: Very much needed.
[24.12.21 17:58:43] elroy: exe->exe seems to be cleaned
[24.12.21 17:58:53] manuel: ok.
[24.12.21 17:58:58] manuel: should I order for you?
[12/24/21 17:59:07] elroy: Do you need it now?
[24.12.21 17:59:17] manuel: staphie's making a coba yet
[24.12.21 17:59:34] manuel: later maybe within an hour schk - dll64
[24.12.21 17:59:54] elroy: haven't gotten to it yet.
[24.12.21 18:00:02] elroy: Now try to integrate
[24.12.21 18:00:03] manuel: got it.
[24.12.21 18:00:05] elroy: Maybe I will.
[24.12.21 18:10:53] manuel: How about hashing tool for Leo?
[24.12.21 18:12:41] elroy: Still in progress...
[12/24/21 18:13:02] elroy: I'll run it on Monday
[24.12.21 18:13:07] elroy: Is it urgent?
[12/24/21/18:13:24] manuel: Monday, yes.
[12/24/21 18:14:26] elroy: Monday night only. Just need an orval cryptor and I'm just about to fix the utility.
[24.12.21 18:14:39] manuel: ok.
[24.12.21 18:17:14] manuel: what about shk crypto - dll64?
[24.12.21 18:19:24] elroy: 10 minutes and I'll tell you
[12/24/21 18:19:31] manuel: waiting
[12/24/21/18:46:00] manuel: Crypto?
[24.12.21 18:52:05] elroy: I don't think the crypto's working.
[12/24/21 18:53:45] manuel: Got it. Okay.
[12/27/221 07:32:58] manuel: Hi.
[12/27/221 07:36:05] manuel: Crypto with Leo's stub?
[12/27/221 08:17:28] elroy: Hi. Not yet.
[27.12.21 08:18:13] manuel: Got it. As long as the alain does.

[28.12.21 08:53:14] manuel: yesterday at alain and carol was dirty
[28.12.21 08:53:19] manuel: maybe your place is cleaner?
[28.12.21 08:53:54] elroy: No, my place is not cleaner...
[28.12.21 08:54:04] manuel: what to do?
[28.12.21 08:54:22] elroy: Yesterday I finished my crypto propagation utility.
[28.12.21 08:54:29] manuel: ok
[28.12.21 08:54:56] elroy: We're screwed with crypto, I think whoever cracked this is using crypto for crypting
[28.12.21 08:55:18] manuel: hacked what?
[28.12.21 08:55:32] elroy: You read about hacking, right?
[28.12.21 08:55:37] manuel: Yes.
[28.12.21 08:55:40] elroy: I wrote it the other day...
[28.12.21 08:55:54] elroy: He leaked our crypto
[12/28/221 08:56:02] elroy: And it looks like he's crypting with them.
[12/28/21 08:56:21] manuel: Holy crap.
[12/28/21 08:56:49] elroy: And I can't get demetrious to just deploy the git and run the build machine. It's the second day he's waiting to pay for servers. No one has a couple thousand rubles and he's not talking...
[28.12.21 08:57:21] manuel: Yeah yeah, I'll talk to him now.
[12/28/221 08:57:47] elroy: I can pay, or let him decide.
[28.12.21 08:57:49] manuel: and sylver's not online for the second day
[28.12.21 08:58:09] manuel: I can't, I'll ask angel if he has
[28.12.21 08:58:09] elroy: The faster we pay for the server, the faster the transaction, the faster everything will go online
[28.12.21 08:58:29] elroy: Let me pay...
[28.12.21 08:58:42] manuel: Go ahead.
[12/28/221 08:58:51] elroy: Silver's on vacation, he'll be out on the 10th
[28.12.21 08:59:24] manuel: Okay.
[12/28/221 14:34:54] elroy: Say, is leo 64 bit ?
[28.12.21 14:35:01] manuel: yes. both the exe and the dll
[28.12.21 14:38:27] elroy: maybe diego will do it, we're talking
[28.12.21 14:42:47] manuel: Great!
[28.12.21 14:42:49] manuel: Got the source code
[12/28/221 15:35:21] elroy: I'm gonna be gone for a couple of hours. Write to diego, he'll give it a try. He's just made a crypto, I need to check Leo later)
[12/28/221 15:35:50] elroy: I'll be gone for a couple hours. Text diego, he'll give it a try. He just made a crypto, need to check then Leo)
[28.12.21 15:36:11] manuel: Yes, I will. Any news on the build machine?
[28.12.21 15:36:24] elroy: Waiting for demetrius' git
[12/28/221 15:36:38] elroy: I paid for the server at 12:00.
[28.12.21 15:36:44] elroy: He promised to roll it out by tonight.
[28.12.21 15:36:50] elroy: But there is silence(
[28.12.21 15:36:52] manuel: Got it. Waiting.
[28.12.21 17:33:18] elroy: Diego did?
[12/28/221 17:33:42] elroy: Diego did?
[28.12.21 17:33:54] manuel: Yes, he did.
[28.12.21 17:34:05] elroy: Great.)
[12/28/221 17:34:10] elroy: One more cryptor.)
[28.12.21 17:34:14] manuel: Yes!
[29.12.21 10:28:41] manuel: and can you crypt the eche and dll coba?
[29.12.21 10:44:48] elroy: I have everything on the cleaner
[29.12.21 10:45:07] manuel: Got it.
[29.12.21 10:45:19] manuel: I need proatos coba dll and exe
[29.12.21 10:45:29] manuel: oh, I'll ask tenton
[29.12.21 10:45:38] elroy: yeah
[12/29/221 10:58:45] elroy: Diego did Leo yesterday. Is it working?
[29.12.21 10:59:04] manuel: Yeah, they say it's okay.
[29.12.21 10:59:11] manuel: Today made 1 assembly. Put it into action.
[29.12.21 10:59:19] elroy: Perfect.)
[29.12.21 10:59:47] manuel: Yes, very glad!
[29.12.21 10:59:52] manuel: And what about build machine?
[29.12.21 11:00:05] elroy: But a utility was asked for crypto diversity. Is it the same customer, i.e. under Leo?
[29.12.21 11:00:13] elroy: I'm waiting for demetrius....
[29.12.21 11:00:17] manuel: Yes, he is.
[29.12.21 11:00:29] elroy: Said he's all done, setting up the pads.
[12/29/221 11:01:00] elroy: The utility is ready, does about 1000 files per minute.
Waiting for fine tuning in crypts for it
[29.12.21 11:01:17] manuel: Does diego already have stub refinement or not yet?
[29.12.21 11:01:35] elroy: That's exactly why I asked if it works or not)
[12/29/221 11:01:38] manuel: Dane is coming out January 3. Maybe he will finish it too.
[12/29/221 11:01:42] elroy: I'll give him a hard time for modifications.
[29.12.21 11:01:50] elroy: Maybe.)
[29.12.21 11:02:29] manuel: let's try to make a lot of crypts with the utility then
[29.12.21 11:02:39] manuel: once gave out his assembly and it works
[29.12.21 11:02:46] elroy: I'll wait for diego's work. Then we will try)
[29.12.21 11:02:52] manuel: ok.
[29.12.21 11:03:40] elroy: This is actually for statistics... Took 20 newbies since summer, in half year only one crypto was written.
[29.12.21 11:04:11] manuel: Wow!
[12/29/221 11:04:19] manuel: And someone hacked the rocket.)
[12/29/221 11:04:34] elroy: And all the other cryptors were drained
[29.12.21 11:04:37] elroy: That's how we work.)
[29.12.21 11:04:44] elroy: Awesome results)
[29.12.21 11:05:56] manuel: Such specifics.
[29.12.21 11:06:12] elroy: Yes... That's exactly the point.
[12/29/221 11:06:22] elroy: You have to teach them...
[29.12.21 11:06:34] manuel: Yes...
[12/29/221 15:08:40] manuel: Another question. Tell me, is the ac on workdays at cryptors?
[12/29/221 15:08:55] manuel: 30 31. 3 and so on.
[12/29/221 15:18:20] elroy: Everyone was told to work. Standby mode will be only if there is a build-machine in operation.
[29.12.21 15:18:25] elroy: This is the position.
[29.12.21 15:18:33] manuel: I see!
[29.12.21 15:18:36] elroy: How it will be in fact - I do not know.
[29.12.21 15:18:37] manuel: That's good!
[29.12.21 15:18:49] manuel: Will you be able to run the build?
[29.12.21 15:18:54] manuel: tomorrow the day after tomorrow?
[29.12.21 15:19:41] elroy: I asked Demetrius the other day, the answer was: "Give me an hour and a half more. Everything will be ".
And will it be or not...
[29.12.21 15:20:13] manuel: I'm kicking him too... We need a build machine. It will be much easier for all of us.
[12/30/21 08:11:47] manuel: Hey. What's the word on the build machine?
[12/30/21/17:18:33] elroy: apr?
[30.12.21 17:19:37] manuel: Yeah.
[12/30/21/17:20:20] manuel: We're only starting 3 on Leo. The customer's out for the weekend.
[30.12.21 17:20:35] manuel: Maybe tomorrow they'll ask for lockers and shk - dll
[30.12.21 17:20:51] manuel: And coba. But not for sure.
[12/30/21 17:20:56] elroy: I checked it a couple of hours ago, the build is done. But something is not stable. There are no profiles in restored Jenkins, we will add them. Plus admins need to fix https, it looks like everything fell off again and admins are missing...
[30.12.21 17:21:18] elroy: In short, the recovery is in progress, but at least something worked already))
[30.12.21 17:21:36] elroy: Yeah, okay. Good
[30.12.21 17:21:43] elroy: Well, we still have tomorrow...
[30.12.21 17:21:46] manuel: Yeah, I saw that already knocked down
[30.12.21 17:21:49] manuel: shk - dll
[30.12.21 17:21:56] elroy: Is it working?
[30.12.21 17:22:01] manuel: not it's still spinning ))
[30.12.21 17:22:04] manuel: Did not knocked down
[30.12.21 17:22:21] elroy: Try Crypto 2
[30.12.21 17:23:13] manuel: Yeah.
[12/30/21 17:26:33] elroy: Shows it's down
[12/30/21 17:29:19] manuel: I see it! Great! 2 means it works!!!
[12/30/21 17:38:46] elroy: Only rundll of the second one works!
[12/30/21 17:38:51] elroy: I'll add the rest.
[30.12.21 17:42:44] manuel: Okay.
[31.12.21 08:46:39] elroy: Greetings.
[31.12.21 08:46:46] manuel: Hello.
[31.12.21 08:46:47] elroy: Hello.
[31.12.21 08:46:55] manuel: Happy New Year
[31.12.21 08:47:02] elroy: Any need for cryptos?)
[31.12.21 08:47:04] elroy: You too.
[31.12.21 08:47:37] manuel: Not yet. Maximum that can be coba eh dll lockers eh dll shk - eh dll
[31.12.21 08:47:53] manuel: You can do it on the buildmachine, right?
[31.12.21 08:48:40] elroy: Only by second crypto, if Rocco doesn't break it now))
[31.12.21 08:48:55] elroy: And the crypter may not be very clean
[31.12.21 08:51:45] manuel: got it. I doubt that someone will ask something today, but you have to be prepared.)
[31.12.21 08:52:17] elroy: I also want to doubt
[03.01.22 12:36:52] manuel: Hi. Happy New Year to you.
[03.01.22 12:37:02] manuel: Tell, does your build-machine work?
[03.01.22 12:45:07] elroy: Hello. Aotr?
[03.01.22 12:48:58] manuel: Hello.
[03.01.22 12:49:04] elroy: Happy New Year!
[03.01.22 12:49:12] elroy: No, the machine doesn't work.
[03.01.22 12:49:18] manuel: Thank you, you too!
[03.01.22 12:49:26] manuel: What's wrong with it?
[03.01.22 12:49:28] elroy: I was puzzling Demetrius in the morning, 0 results.
[03.01.22 12:49:31] manuel: When will it come to life?
[03.01.22 12:49:43] elroy: Demetrius alone knows when
[03.01.22 12:50:01] elroy: I have no access, he must be busy with something else in the morning.
[03.01.22 12:50:07] manuel: I see
[03.01.22 12:50:14] manuel: Something with admin part.
[03.01.22 12:51:14] elroy: There by volume it's nothing, there ports and firewall most likely
[03.01.22 12:51:26] elroy: But waiting since morning...
[04.01.22 10:16:38] manuel: hi
[04.01.22 10:17:12] manuel: tell me, is your build-machine working?
[04.01.22 10:17:54] elroy: Greetings. No. Lost control of the build server. Already a new demeterius is setting up.
[04.01.22 10:18:14] manuel: i see...
[04.01.22 10:18:33] elroy: If Rocco fixes it when he comes back, it'll be two)
[04.01.22 10:20:24] manuel: and who sechvs shk - dll 64 can make and 32 eh crypt?
[04.01.22 10:20:36] manuel: now
[04.01.22 10:21:35] elroy: Write to the guys or in chat, who can do it. If not - I'll try, but I do not have everything clear.
[04.01.22 10:21:43] elroy: Write to diego
[05.01.22 14:31:47] manuel: Hi. What about the buildmachine? When will it come to life?
[05.01.22 14:32:28] elroy: Greetings. It has come to life. The guys are adding cryptors. Crypter 2 and 8 should be up and running by now.
[05.01.22 14:32:42] manuel: will shk do it?
[05.01.22 14:32:49] elroy: Crypter 2
[05.01.22 14:33:08] elroy: Or later Diego will add crypter 8 for shk
[05.01.22 14:33:14] elroy: I'm teaching it now
[05.01.22 14:33:51] manuel: Okay.
[05.01.22 14:37:51] manuel: Got it. Thanks
[05.01.22 14:38:14] manuel: Another question, what about randomization tool Leo and stubs for it?
[05.01.22 14:39:22] elroy: utility is ready, stubs should ask diego and orval, I think they already had
[05.01.22 14:39:43] manuel: And Dane?
[05.01.22 14:40:09] elroy: He just came out, I haven't told him yet
[05.01.22 14:40:41] manuel: Okay.
[05.01.22 14:41:02] manuel: he's been doing crypto in the morning for 3 days now
[05.01.22 14:41:32] elroy: that's why I haven't uploaded it yet
[05.01.22 14:41:41] elroy: Otherwise there'd be nobody to do the crypts)
[05.01.22 14:41:57] manuel: I see.)
[05.01.22 14:42:18] elroy: I'll give him the task one day
[05.01.22 14:42:39] manuel: Ok
[06.01.22 10:02:56] elroy: Greetings
[06.01.22 10:20:02] manuel: Hello
[06.01.22 10:22:41] elroy: ok?
[06.01.22 10:37:37] manuel: come on.
[06.01.22 10:52:18] elroy: Go again)
[06.01.22 10:53:56] manuel: Hi.
[06.01.22 10:54:15] elroy: Tell me, what about cryptos for today/tomorrow? How do you work?
[06.01.22 10:54:54] manuel: also stab leo, shk -heh shk dll, cobalt
[06.01.22 10:55:09] elroy: I see.
[06.01.22 10:55:28] manuel: build-machine would be perfect - I'd saw it myself
[06.01.22 10:55:29] elroy: I informed dane, he will rebuild crypto on builds
[06.01.22 10:55:47] elroy: There's also carrol restored crypter 7
[06.01.22 10:56:04] manuel: great! what can he do?
[06.01.22 10:56:12] elroy: we have crypter 2, 7, 8 on builds now + maybe dane and allen will add
[06.01.22 10:56:22] elroy: Everything seems to be what it was
[06.01.22 10:56:48] elroy: *maybe they will add today
[06.01.22 10:57:21] manuel: great
[10.01.22 10:12:59] manuel: hi.
[10.01.22 10:13:15] manuel: I have a question
[10.01.22 10:13:37] elroy: Ask
[10.01.22 10:13:41] elroy: Hello
[10.01.22 10:13:57] manuel: On hashing for stub Leo
[10.01.22 10:14:06] manuel: Utility.
[10.01.22 10:14:23] elroy: There is a utility. Something cryptors are hanging on.
[10.01.22 10:14:27] elroy: I'll find out today
[10.01.22 10:15:07] manuel: Okay. Thank you.
[11.01.22 08:52:12] manuel: Hi. I have a question.
[11.01.22 08:52:57] elroy: Hello, ask
[11.01.22 08:53:04] manuel: Question about Leo's stbs.
[11.01.22 08:53:11] manuel: How are they doing with the utility
[11.01.22 08:54:26] elroy: Just now dane wrote back that stb is ready, everything works. Now only fuzzy hashes will be checked. Well, I guess we could do a test one today.
[11.01.22 08:54:38] manuel: go ahead.
[11.01.22 08:54:51] manuel: Did you already fill it into build-machine?
[11.01.22 08:55:17] elroy: No, but I'll check it now.
[11.01.22 08:55:42] manuel: there in the buildmachine was 7 stub pure by Leo now dirty on eset in avcek
[11.01.22 08:56:06] manuel: Can it be cleaned? Or maybe someone else has more clean stubs?
[11.01.22 08:56:57] elroy: did you look at 12?
[11.01.22 08:57:40] manuel: I'll run it
[11.01.22 09:19:01] manuel: Yeah 12 is clean. I'll use it when Dane leaves. Thank you!
[11.01.22 09:20:20] elroy: Thanks Orval, it's his other cryptor)
[11.01.22 09:20:48] manuel: and 13 whose crypter? I see there's a genre in the echo
[11.01.22 09:21:03] elroy: More soon Diego will finish, will be 13 Leo. There is already 13 rundll.
[11.01.22 09:21:16] manuel: Diego got it))
[11.01.22 09:21:25] elroy: Yeah)
[11.01.22 09:21:47] manuel: Beautiful!
[11.01.22 09:35:58] elroy: generated samples look alike at best 58%, at worst 95% look alike on fuzzy hashes. (on clear hashes of course all files are different)
[11.01.22 09:36:19] manuel: I see.
[11.01.22 09:36:38] elroy: Actually, as I gave 3 variants then.
[11.01.22 09:36:44] manuel: Yes.
[11.01.22 09:36:55] elroy: It turns out, when just variant with string, there 99% similarity))
[11.01.22 09:37:52] elroy: If you're satisfied with 58% of similarity at first, you can make a crypt from Dane and take a utility
[11.01.22 09:38:06] elroy: 1000 files per minute (by eye)
[11.01.22 09:39:43] manuel: Let's try it
[11.01.22 09:39:52] elroy: Okay, text him
[11.01.22 10:00:26] manuel: He's not ready yet either.
[11.01.22 10:00:36] manuel: Does anyone have it ready? Or we wait?
[11.01.22 10:00:55] elroy: Just a minute.
[11.01.22 11:16:20] elroy: Minute delayed)
[11.01.22 11:16:28] manuel: Yeah)
[11.01.22 11:17:58] elroy: There Dane wrote that he can not make loader, only finishes the bot. He says that sometimes he can get a 0% semblance of it. I was just fixing the utility still... In general, the work boils, but so far no one to do. One more minute, I will check with Orval.
[11.01.22 11:18:17] manuel: ok
[11.01.22 11:22:04] elroy: Orval writes
```
hashes do not match 0 yet
```
[11.01.22 11:22:14] elroy: Still doing it too
[11.01.22 11:23:12] manuel: got it. waiting
[11.01.22 13:46:55] elroy: Let's refresh the test samples, the ones on the morning crypts
[11.01.22 13:47:57] manuel: yes. i'll send them now
[11.01.22 13:48:20] elroy: I need:
cobalt 32 64 dll exe
leo bot 64 dll
leo loader 64 dll
trike exe
[11.01.22 13:48:40] elroy: Or let's go by your list))
[11.01.22 13:48:55] manuel: yeah, i'll see what i have
[11.01.22 13:56:04] manuel: poured 22.7z into one
[11.01.22 13:59:28] elroy: Is there a cobalt exe? What is beacon and artifact ?
[11.01.22 13:59:50] manuel: Yes they are versions of cobalt
[11.01.22 14:00:16] elroy: I see.
[11.01.22 14:01:13] elroy: There at the very top we have atm. I remember it's just there as a reminder, reminds me of crypting silk code as a dll. It's not needed there anymore?
[11.01.22 14:01:58] manuel: you need shellcode as a dll and an exe
[11.01.22 14:02:07] manuel: I don't use atm
[11.01.22 14:02:21] elroy: I know you do)
[11.01.22 14:02:27] elroy: I don't clean it)
[11.01.22 14:02:33] elroy: Is that atm needed there?
[11.01.22 14:02:40] elroy: I think you created it
[11.01.22 14:02:45] manuel: I don't think so
[11.01.22 14:03:08] elroy: I'll delete it, if anything return)
[11.01.22 14:03:15] manuel: Yeah
[11.01.22 14:46:26] elroy: And how do you crypt cobalt now? The one dll.
[11.01.22 14:46:46] manuel: randll32 with stub.
[11.01.22 14:46:54] manuel: either stanton does
[11.01.22 14:46:57] elroy: And it works?
[11.01.22 14:47:02] manuel: yes

[12.01.22 09:35:48] elroy: Yes. But because we still roll back the technology, the utility can be updated
[12.01.22 09:35:53] elroy: Need sorts?

[27.01.22 13:58:38] elroy: Is that all our testers too?
[27.01.22 13:59:34] manuel: yes. there is also a tester of tric modules - eugene he tests tric modules
[27.01.22 14:00:22] manuel: garfiell also! He's on buildmachine and vmc now. Before that he was building trikes.
[27.01.22 14:00:32] manuel: garfield
[27.01.22 14:01:16] elroy: How do you spell "herald"?
[27.01.22 14:01:47] manuel: gerald
[27.01.22 14:02:03] elroy: What's with the tric, by the way?
[27.01.22 14:02:55] manuel: they stopped the project
[27.01.22 14:03:01] manuel: Trick 2 is being prepared for emoteed
[27.01.22 14:04:08] elroy: ``

```
This is not our tric then it turns out ?
but efrain ?
[27.01.22 14:06:25] manuel: yes, it is. he was giving out the trick.
[27.01.22 14:06:43] manuel: Ours just reworked it dan and gave it to ned for support and improvement
[27.01.22 14:07:49] elroy: I mean the news. We do not have this functionality.
[27.01.22 14:08:11] elroy: Does Trick work in a browser?
[27.01.22 14:09:38] manuel: What's the news?
[27.01.22 14:10:10] elroy: I gave you the link above.
[27.01.22 14:10:13] manuel: In the browser how? There are usual eche and dll and modules with different functionality: password grabber, vnts, domain detection.
[27.01.22 14:11:23] elroy: Here they write
```
IBM Trusteer analysts report that TrickBot has now acquired several new layers of protection designed to bypass anti-virus products and protect against learning.

Researchers write that TrickBot developers use several levels of obfuscation and base64 for scripts, including minimization, string extraction and replacement, dead code injection, and so-called monkey patching. Currently TrickBot has even too many levels of obfuscation, which makes its analysis slow, and it often gives unreliable results.

In addition, during injections of malicious scripts into web pages (to steal credentials), injections do not involve local resources on the victim machine, but rely solely on the attackers' own servers. As a result, analysts are unable to retrieve malware samples from the memory of infected machines. At the same time, TrickBot communicates with its control servers via HTTPS, which also makes it difficult to study.
```
[27.01.22 14:12:06] manuel: Strange. We do not give out tricks for a whole month...
[27.01.22 14:12:20] manuel: Well, yes there are bots left, but about this I do not know.
[27.01.22 14:12:37] elroy: I see... I was just wondering myself.
[27.01.22 14:12:49] elroy: Is cesar gone or what?
[27.01.22 14:12:57] elroy: I thought that was his trick.
[27.01.22 14:13:38] manuel: He's been gone since the end of December.
[27.01.22 14:13:45] manuel: Maybe this is the new project?
[27.01.22 14:13:54] manuel: The one they're talking about and where Dan left
[27.01.22 14:13:59] elroy: They didn't give out anything
[27.01.22 14:14:15] elroy: it seems Dane left not on tric 2
[27.01.22 14:14:34] elroy: There for the cryptocurrency project, I understand.
[27.01.22 14:14:43] elroy: Although. maybe I got it wrong)))
[27.01.22 14:14:45] manuel: Hmm...
[27.01.22 14:14:50] manuel: cryptocurrencies!
[27.01.22 14:15:30] elroy: They wrote to me like this:
```
i'm taking van to another field of crypto
```
[27.01.22 14:16:02] elroy: Although, who knows. Maybe crypto doesn't equal cryptocurrency
[27.01.22 14:16:20] manuel: Maybe ))
[27.01.22 14:16:26] manuel: Or maybe something tricky )))
[28.01.22 08:54:17] manuel: Hi. I have a question.
[28.01.22 08:55:06] elroy: Hello.
[28.01.22 08:55:46] manuel: Can someone make crypto dll from shellcode tcht?
[28.01.22 08:59:19] elroy: crypto can, but it's not on the panel
[28.01.22 08:59:23] elroy: *cryptor 2
[28.01.22 08:59:49] manuel: how to do?
[28.01.22 08:59:56] elroy: you can convert to bin and make any cryptor
[28.01.22 09:00:16] manuel: Convert what?
[28.01.22 09:00:18] elroy: Send it to me, I'll make it into .bin and send it over
[28.01.22 09:00:30] manuel: ``

[28.01.22 09:01:42] elroy: okay, just a moment

[31.01.22 07:59:48] elroy: apr?
[31.01.22 08:00:08] manuel: Bildmachine lies. Who can I order crypto Leo from?
[31.01.22 08:00:15] manuel: 11 stub was clean and 3 more or less
[31.01.22 08:00:32] elroy: 3 - Allen, you can write to him, he's in touch
[31.01.22 08:01:07] manuel: Thanks! Great!
[31.01.22 08:59:28] manuel: No answer.
[31.01.22 08:59:30] manuel: Allen.
[31.01.22 09:32:00] manuel: Another question.
[31.01.22 09:32:15] manuel: Zeus said that you have the source code of their bots and loider. Requests a cleanup. Can we arrange cleaning?
[31.01.22 09:37:24] elroy: Anubis?
[31.01.22 09:37:36] elroy: Yes, talked to him just recently, today
[31.01.22 09:37:36] manuel: Yes.
[31.01.22 09:37:46] manuel: Yeah he asked me to write too
[31.01.22 09:37:51] elroy: Yes, we can, in progress.
[31.01.22 09:38:27] manuel: Got it. Do you have any idea about the timing?
[31.01.22 09:40:44] elroy: No, there is an understanding that there are coders for this, but further - no. I need him (the designated coder) looked at the project, looked at the detects...
[31.01.22 10:46:25] manuel: And who else could do Leo? Diego dirty alain rewrites.
[31.01.22 10:46:30] manuel: 11 stub is dirty too.
[31.01.22 10:47:19] elroy: does allen's stub on the builds also dirty?
[31.01.22 10:47:31] manuel: 3 yes
[31.01.22 10:48:21] elroy: diego maybe?
[31.01.22 10:48:36] elroy: Better ask Orval, he's got cryptors now...
[31.01.22 10:49:37] manuel: Got it. He's dirty too.
[31.01.22 16:43:02] manuel: I have another question.
[31.01.22 16:43:38] manuel: And how to hook up commands? ps1 file
[31.01.22 16:43:43] manuel: Checked
[31.01.22 16:44:27] elroy: To write an exe that will call verichel commands. That is how to script
[31.01.22 16:44:36] elroy: How else - use obfuscator
[31.01.22 16:45:21] manuel: We don't do that? Obfuscator.
[31.01.22 16:45:34] elroy: Not really.
[31.01.22 16:45:47] elroy: this is the first time I heard it))
[31.01.22 16:45:54] elroy: We definitely do not have an obfuscator
[31.01.22 16:46:00] manuel: I see.
[31.01.22 16:46:15] manuel: Someone=used to make an exe and a dll
[31.01.22 16:46:29] manuel: sam seems to be. But there's something about him I can't see.
[03.02.22 13:41:26] manuel: Hi. I need your help.
[03.02.22 13:41:46] elroy: Hello.
[03.02.22 13:42:18] manuel: I can't give Zeus a crypt all dirty on avcek. I'm writing to cryptters no one answers
[03.02.22 13:42:35] manuel: we need a dedicated cryptor for zeus' crypts to clean stubs every day
[03.02.22 13:42:42] manuel: Like Dane did
[03.02.22 13:43:38] elroy: I can't offer a dedicated one, except to remove someone from crypts and allocate to Zeus.
[03.02.22 13:44:24] elroy: Write personally diego and carrol, if they can not, only orval
[03.02.22 13:45:05] elroy: I talked to S yesterday, I was told to take 2 out of 10 newcomers, the rest to send free vacation. No people.
[03.02.22 13:45:21] elroy: took 4 and not on crypto...
[03.02.22 13:46:12] manuel: How do I get this to Zeus?
[03.02.22 13:46:31] elroy: Withdraw from other cryptos
[03.02.22 13:46:55] manuel: Good option. Zeus is a key client, as I understand it.
[03.02.22 13:47:10] elroy: Well, you can do that
[03.02.22 14:43:57] manuel: Hi. Will you be able to clean the stub for leo? There's an eset stuck to it.

[11.02.22 13:37:21] elroy: Tell me, who are neville and sauveterre ?
[11.02.22 13:37:41] manuel: neville is me
[11.02.22 13:37:49] manuel: and sauviterre is sam.
[11.02.22 13:38:02] elroy: are those two external crypto?
[11.02.22 13:38:28] manuel: neville is ours, and I don't know about sam.
[11.02.22 13:38:52] elroy: Do these two have the rights to do the build?
[11.02.22 13:39:36] elroy: 45 consumers get... a lot))
[11.02.22 13:40:21] manuel: They manually make and upload finished crypts to the panel
[11.02.22 13:40:24] manuel: panel
[11.02.22 13:40:33] elroy: Do you have rights ?
[11.02.22 13:41:09] manuel: yes
[11.02.22 13:41:14] manuel: tabs are loaded
[11.02.22 13:41:43] elroy: They need to remove their rights to the build, they're cryptors themselves...
[11.02.22 13:42:17] elroy: I see, we have plenty of places to leak
[11.02.22 13:42:50] elroy: That's why everything is dirty, 45 consumers for 9 cryptors, and 3 cryptors only work normally...
[11.02.22 13:42:58] elroy: How are we still holding on))
[11.02.22 13:43:28] manuel: Yeah
[11.02.22 13:44:18] manuel: Done.

[14.02.22 08:32:05] manuel: Hi.
[14.02.22 08:33:43] elroy: Hello
[14.02.22 08:34:59] manuel: Stub situation for Zeus again. With hurrah is dirty, and orval is not.
[14.02.22 08:35:08] manuel: I need a separate crypto for these stubs
[14.02.22 08:35:59] manuel: To make it clean in the morning so you can make crypts.
[14.02.22 08:37:14] elroy: You see, there's nowhere to get it... I've been trying to coordinate something for days now, but there's silence at the top.
[14.02.22 08:37:31] manuel: I understand perfectly.
[14.02.22 08:37:33] elroy: Cryptor is needed - we'll allocate it, but there are no people...
[14.02.22 08:38:05] elroy: As soon as Orval shows up, coordinate with him who he'll allocate
[14.02.22 08:38:14] manuel: Good.
[14.02.22 08:38:34] elroy: Of those who are. But the one he will allocate is unlikely to be able to clean day in day out anyway.
[16.02.22 08:39:12] manuel: Prviet.
[16.02.22 08:39:16] manuel: I have a question.
[16.02.22 08:43:31] elroy: Hello.
[16.02.22 08:44:09] manuel: I can't get a rush on the rp
[16.02.22 08:44:21] elroy: Yes
[16.02.22 08:44:24] manuel: Yeah.
[16.02.22 08:46:12] manuel: Still the same problem with the key client, Zeus. All of his stubs are dirty this morning. Did a good job yesterday. The stubs were clean. Need clean stubs every day in the morning. Ideally, a separate crimper, or a separate priority task for the crimper to clean the stubs for Zeus.
[16.02.22 08:46:39] manuel: He has the highest turnover of crypts.
[16.02.22 08:51:19] elroy: Did you write Orval with this question?
[16.02.22 08:56:43] manuel: Yes.
[16.02.22 08:59:46] elroy: What did he say?
[16.02.22 08:59:48] elroy: Highlighted?
[16.02.22 09:00:48] manuel: no.
[16.02.22 09:00:57] manuel: He did not.
[16.02.22 09:02:41] elroy: Write to Franz that you need a dedicated cryptor. I got a very interesting response from Franz on this subject.
[16.02.22 09:03:34] manuel: What answer?
[16.02.22 09:08:05] elroy: Franz:
```
I made my suggestions there, I'm waiting to hear what they say.
i suggested they put it all in separate structures, let them pay for themselves at least partially, because it's crazy to spend 50 100k bucks every month on something no one really uses
crypto eche costs 30 bucks, it's a fucking 100, and it makes sense to keep 10 cryptors on payroll, testers, farm and build machine
```
If there's no one to choose from 10 cryptors, then it's time to distribute them all to other tasks.
That's all that's realistic right now.
Allocate two people to the tasks of Zeus I can, but it will only be his tasks, and no others. People aren't pulling their weight.
To make it work we need more cryptors, at least 10 more people.
Does not work well for everyone, but everyone gets a little.
[16.02.22 09:10:22] elroy: Question for consideration in general on crypto...
[16.02.22 09:10:30] manuel: Every day you take not 1 crypto, but 20-30-100 cryptos
[16.02.22 09:10:41] manuel: By Zeus.
[16.02.22 09:11:05] elroy: he pays 3 thousand bucks a day for cryptos?
[16.02.22 09:11:29] manuel: I don't know. About his fees.
[16.02.22 09:11:48] manuel: In addition to Zevsa, there are pintsters who make shellcodes
[16.02.22 09:11:51] elroy: So... And no one knows. The question with profitability arose
[16.02.22 09:11:56] manuel: Yes.
[16.02.22 09:12:04] manuel: I understand.
[16.02.22 09:13:03] elroy: In general, I'm all for it and will advise and guide everyone. But on profitability I have no information on any project. While they are there to decide something, you can not do anything.
[16.02.22 09:13:10] elroy: Ask Orval....
[16.02.22 09:13:43] manuel: Got it. I'll ask him to do Leo's cleansing tasks then.
[18.02.22 08:49:25] manuel: Hi. I have a question.
[18.02.22 08:51:01] elroy: Hello. Ask
[18.02.22 08:52:03] manuel: Something with the build-machine. Making builds every once in a while. Ordered 6 crypts with dll_leo-loader-bot_crypter12 and only made 3.
[18.02.22 08:52:11] manuel: What can it be?
[18.02.22 08:52:23] manuel: During last two days I made about 1000 crypts in total
[18.02.22 08:52:28] manuel: Maybe something is jammed?
[18.02.22 08:52:29] elroy: I need to move Demeterius
[18.02.22 08:52:52] elroy: I'll also look into it later
[18.02.22 09:15:23] elroy: I made 6 crypts today with stub dll_leo-loader-bot_crypter12 ?
[18.02.22 09:20:08] manuel: yes
[18.02.22 09:20:35] elroy: According to Jenkins, all builds were successful
[18.02.22 09:20:45] elroy: last fails were just yesterday
[18.02.22 09:20:49] elroy: For 12 kryptor
[18.02.22 09:21:09] elroy: Maybe there's something wrong with the panel, or the connection
[18.02.22 09:21:17] elroy: Try again...
[18.02.22 09:21:31] manuel: ↳ loader_dll_64_donat4_150182_1.dll has Failed status

[18.02.22 16:47:56] manuel: On the issue of testing trike. As I used to do.
[18.02.22 16:48:13] manuel: It was simple. I was running crypt on vm and watching the stall in black admin.
[18.02.22 16:48:50] manuel: There appeared bot from ipi machine, from which I launched File.
[18.02.22 16:49:54] manuel: I was waiting 10-15 minutes for modules to load: network dll pvgrabi something else was
[18.02.22 16:50:09] manuel: if he started without detection on vm, he gave crypt to work.
[18.02.22 16:59:45] elroy: 5 messages did not come
[18.02.22 16:59:54] manuel: On the issue of testing trike. The way I used to do it.
It was simple. Started crypt on vm watching the output in the black admin.
There appeared bot with ipi of the machine from which I ran the file.
I waited 10-15 minutes for modules to load: network dll pvgrabi something else was
If they started without detekt on vm then gave crypt to work.
[18.02.22 17:00:39] elroy: Was the VM configured somehow?
[18.02.22 17:00:46] manuel: Standard
[18.02.22 17:00:58] elroy: And os 7 ?
[18.02.22 17:01:06] manuel: Everything is enabled on autos except auto-send samples
[18.02.22 17:01:30] manuel: 7 vin Windows was also tested for workability
[18.02.22 17:01:30] elroy: And telemetry?
[18.02.22 17:02:09] elroy: You didn't run O&O Shutup beforehand?
[18.02.22 17:02:17] manuel: No.
[18.02.22 17:02:53] elroy: And who invented such a test?
[18.02.22 17:03:11] manuel: It was at the very beginning when I joined two years ago
[18.02.22 17:03:14] elroy: Did you look specifically at the operability or the detective test in operation?
[18.02.22 17:03:22] manuel: I got it from the tester who taught me
[18.02.22 17:03:49] manuel: Checked operability, detective to start, detective to run modules
[18.02.22 17:04:19] elroy: So basically the goal was just to run it on the end machine
[18.02.22 17:04:21] elroy: ?
[18.02.22 17:04:27] manuel: yes.
[18.02.22 17:04:35] elroy: Got it.
[18.02.22 17:04:36] elroy: Thank you.
[18.02.22 17:05:12] elroy: And you run shutup at your workplace?
[18.02.22 17:05:27] manuel: No.
[18.02.22 17:17:09] elroy: There are about 100 options which affect anonymity. Including "prohibit Microsoft from doing experiments on this computer" option.
[18.02.22 17:17:57] manuel: How do I configure all this?
[18.02.22 17:45:21] elroy: Download the program

[22.02.22 09:50:50] elroy: Greetings. That's all a great thing to do. Frans wrote me yesterday that we don't get any money from partners. We work for free.
