Hi. When can you upload the bots for us?

2020-07-14T14:54:58 mors -> bentley
Hi, is it a test ? or is it already in the works ?

2020-07-14T14:55:23 mors -> bentley
in general just waiting for Doc to clean me, I think another 3 days, and so the spam is ready to work - everything

2020-07-14T14:55:55 mors -> bentley
if you have a dock, you can basically set up on my links, and start

2020-07-14T15:00:00 mors -> bentley
[17:57:09] <01> I'll definitely make it by Monday
[17:57:31] <01> Might be done by Friday


we are already focused on these numbers - but it's 100% my word) if the docker does not let us down on the 17th or 20th of july it works out

2020-07-14T15:06:42 bentley -> mors
