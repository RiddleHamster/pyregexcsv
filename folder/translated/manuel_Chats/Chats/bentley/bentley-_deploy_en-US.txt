I don't understand the problem. Crypts ld1 is not coming in today. Chrome doesn't want to let the signed file through from any link. And yesterday's crypt is ok. But it's already burned.  Is there anything we can do?

Hi Tim. We have the Internet blocked in RB. Signed certificates do not work. Unencrypted and self-signed resources work. Ports 22, 23 UDP is blocked. I do not know when they will turn it on. Tell your bosses who will see it. Ask Green, maybe he can advise me what to do.  Reply to the course can only here as well in the comments. Toad does not work. Talar.

[15:00:20] <target> [11:02:06] <buza> about the name is clear - apparently, stub is spammed by crypt, if your anchrypt worked with combat name
[15:02:34] <bentley> I think Deploy had several stubs.

2020-09-08-08T08:04:03 bentley -> deploy
<buza> it turns out that the name detection is given not to our source, but to crypto
[15:02:37] <buza> but for us it doesn't change anything because we have to adjust to the problems of crypt

2020-09-08T08:14:00:00 deploy -> bentley

2020-09-08-08T08:15:14 bentley -> deploy
What's the source code? There were two different ones.

2020-09-08T08:15:24 bentley -> deploy

2020-09-08-08T08:16:22:00 -> bentley

2020-09-08T08:18:55:00

When did you check that? When the server wasn't working from where the bk loads? Or when everything was already working?

2020-09-08T08:26:44 bentley -> deploy

2020-09-08-08T08:31:37:00 -> bentley
Did you clean the bot?

2020-09-08T08:32:14 bentley -> deploy
Yes I was already issuing a clean one. I'll check today before issuing it to crypt

2020-09-08-08T08:32:49:00 -> bentley

2020-09-08T08:33:28 bentley -> deploy

[13:42:21] <Van> Hi! )))
I've read everything. Checked the non-crypted one on Dinchek, the statics are clean at all, the dynamics are much better than the crypta:
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/2bd5751861ec52478189ceb09131cdc5

Detect on Avira immediately, as if static, I do not do anything for the first 2 minutes.
The other two detects - I do not know what to do with them, and they are even without pictures. Maybe so - paranoia. Basic AVs are clean.
Tried to check uncrypted on autotest. Semantec, Avast, Webroot something did not start, the rest went fine. Under Defender and so every day I check manually.
Something has changed in crypt. It started copying itself into Internet cache folder.
These copies make AV very angry.

In terms of detection, there is a big difference here at all. For example, take a file and download directly through google drive and make a run or put in the archive extract from the archive and run. The last option defender does not approve

2020-09-25T10:25:54:54 deploy -> bentley
At work, we directly download the file via google drive

Another nuance today. Van made different bk's to work with. They work in a pair: BK 1 + Lauder1

2020-09-28T09:26:38 bentley -> deploy
We must therefore upload the new BC as soon as they start working with the new version of the loafer

2020-09-28T09:29:18 bentley -> deploy
Somehow I need to understand when and which version of the loader is running so I can drop off a new BC

2020-09-28T09:29:46 bentley -> deploy
Right now the test BC is running in the test version. When you start working it should be changed to a working one

2020-09-28T09:33:26:00 -> bentley

 <mushroom> Most likely it's a crypt file because I name the files differently. I name them like this AF60.exe (without tmp in the name) and there AF60.tmp.exe.
[15:18:55] <mushroom> Ask whoever did the crypt, he writes something in temp folder.

2020-10-09T08:21:51:00 -> bentley

If you move the file to the desktop, then ok, but if you upload to google drive and then run it, then you get detected, after injecting into cmd
