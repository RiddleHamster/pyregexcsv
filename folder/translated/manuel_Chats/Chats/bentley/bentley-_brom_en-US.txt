We have work from a comp.

2020-09-23T09:51:24 brom -> bentley

2020-09-23T09:51:58 bentley -> brom
And later than 18?

2020-09-23T09:52:28 brom -> bentley
If required,

2020-09-23T09:53:10 brom -> bentley
I can. maybe in time I will leave my current day job - soon

2020-09-23T09:53:20 bentley -> brom
We have until 20 from 11 to 20 Can we work like this?

2020-09-23T09:54:10 brom -> bentley

2020-09-23T09:55:00 brom -> bentley
only with a laptop, as an option, a converter in the car

2020-09-23T09:55:18 bentley -> brom
That's a pain in the ass.

2020-09-23T09:55:27 bentley -> brom
What time zone are you in?

2020-09-23T09:55:46 brom -> bentley
You don't have to drive as long as there's traffic I can work from the mini-office

2020-09-23T09:55:57 brom -> bentley
+3.00 UTC

2020-09-23T09:56:02 bentley -> brom

Anyway, if all goes well, I can leave that job. The plan is.

2020-09-23T09:57:45 bentley -> brom
Our job in general is not difficult but monotonous

2020-09-23T09:57:55 bentley -> brom
I mean doing the same thing many times a day

2020-09-23T09:58:13 brom -> bentley
How many days a week would it take?

2020-09-23T09:59:11 bentley -> brom
Standard 5 day work week. Only we don't have standard holidays

2020-09-23T09:59:50 brom -> bentley

Yes

2020-09-24T08:39:39 bentley -> brom

2020-09-24T10:47:55 bentley -> brom
Let's make comps - check it out.

2020-09-24T10:51:52 brom -> bentley

Windows requires activation - ignore?

2020-09-25T11:39:26 bentley -> brom
Yep

2020-09-25T12:13:15 brom -> bentley
Automatic sample submission is off. Or through MAPS Administrative Templates (0X2) group policies to not send samples? Are these actions equivalent?

2020-09-25T12:13:31 bentley -> brom
Better in Defender settings

2020-09-25T12:14:30 brom -> bentley
Ok, it's more accessible - the yellow triangle is displayed-is that correct?

2020-09-25T12:14:58 bentley -> brom
yes

2020-09-25T12:32:01 brom -> bentley
takes a long time to update

2020-09-25T12:32:17 bentley -> brom
Yep

2020-09-25T13:16:16 brom -> bentley
Done, updated

2020-09-25T13:17:01 bentley -> brom
Great! Snapshots?

2020-09-25T13:17:04 brom -> bentley
the last two win 7's were not required-right?

2020-09-25T13:17:15 brom -> bentley
Yes snaps made

2020-09-25T13:17:44 bentley -> brom
Not required. We have 7 to check the work simply

2020-09-25T13:19:49 brom -> bentley
You can still work today.

2020-09-25T13:20:21 bentley -> brom
So do you have access to internal resources?

2020-09-25T13:20:33 bentley -> brom

2020-09-25T13:23:04 bentley -> brom
By cryptopanel, the testing algorithm

2020-09-25T13:23:10 bentley -> brom
and BK

2020-09-25T13:23:19 brom -> bentley
Is the BC a backdoor controller?

2020-09-25T13:23:26 bentley -> brom
Yes

2020-09-25T13:23:56 bentley -> brom

2020-09-28T09:49:30 bentley -> brom
No and win7 Too

2020-09-28T09:49:39 bentley -> brom
You need it to check the workability

2020-09-28T09:50:02 brom -> bentley
ok

2020-09-28T09:56:12 brom -> bentley
There is a problem connecting to the virtual machine. (password may have changed)

2020-09-28T09:58:04 bentley -> brom
What's the mistake?

2020-09-28T10:01:37 brom -> bentley
The client could not connect to the remote computer

2020-09-28T10:02:10 bentley -> brom

2020-09-28T10:02:28 brom -> bentley

2020-09-28T10:03:03 brom -> bentley

2020-09-28T10:05:27 bentley -> brom
Try restarting the VM.

2020-09-28T10:06:16 brom -> bentley
now through the panel - it's available to me

2020-09-28T10:07:02 bentley -> brom
Do you know how to do it?

2020-09-28T10:07:42 brom -> bentley
reset&

2020-09-28T10:08:12 brom -> bentley
? rather do not know, no result yet

2020-09-28T10:08:41 bentley -> brom
You select a car. Above Stop - Power OFF

2020-09-28T10:08:51 bentley -> brom
Are there no snapshots?

2020-09-28T10:09:34 brom -> bentley
snap is done. I'm going to try again.

2020-09-28T10:09:48 bentley -> brom
Another nuance. You need to update vm 10 and 2019 and make new snaps before you work.

2020-09-28T10:10:01 brom -> bentley
OK

2020-09-28T10:16:20 brom -> bentley
went to 2019-64 (serv)-first snap-first test-right?

2020-09-28T10:17:05 brom -> bentley
After updating, I add snapshot... etc.

2020-09-28T10:19:30 bentley -> brom
Look completely update 2019 and the Defender base. Turn it off. and do a new snapshot

2020-09-28T10:19:52 bentley -> brom
Also check that Defender has disabled automatic sending of samples

2020-09-28T10:20:24 bentley -> brom
You also need to put on the machine itself winrar and chrome, to make it easier to download files and unpack archives

2020-09-28T10:20:25 brom -> bentley
ok as in Friday, and clouds included.

2020-09-28T10:27:50 brom -> bentley
because data encryption session is over can someone climb in parallel?

2020-09-28T10:28:12 bentley -> brom
Maybe it's just dumb.

2020-09-28T10:28:14 brom -> bentley
I disabled the replay session

2020-09-28T10:28:31 brom -> bentley
Ok, I'll connect again.

2020-09-28T10:43:53 brom -> bentley
It's fine updating (glitched me).

2020-09-28T10:44:50 bentley -> brom
Okay

2020-09-28T11:11:04 brom -> bentley
while it's being updated can I ask you a question?

2020-09-28T11:11:20 bentley -> brom
Of course

2020-09-28T11:11:24 bentley -> brom
Needed!

2020-09-28T11:12:09 brom -> bentley
I downloaded the file, then should the krpter process it so there were no detects? how to plant it in the system?

2020-09-28T11:12:47 bentley -> brom
What do you mean by cryptor?

2020-09-28T11:14:21 brom -> bentley
if I understand correctly: there is a function in the cryptopanel -like wrap the file with a cryptor (a script and a program) that makes it invisible to AB

2020-09-28T11:16:06 bentley -> brom
No

2020-09-28T11:16:25 bentley -> brom
We have special people doing cryptocurrencies. It's not that simple with this process.

2020-09-28T11:18:45 brom -> bentley
bk test plan -did i get a loader?

2020-09-28T11:21:06 bentley -> brom
Yes, you get the lowader from the coder. But for the duration of the training - from me.

2020-09-28T11:21:18 bentley -> brom
Running it on 3 machines: 7 10 2019

2020-09-28T11:21:45 bentley -> brom
and then according to the plan: queries get ssinfo ran ehe ran dll ran bat ran vershel

2020-09-28T11:22:17 brom -> bentley
I'm clear for now, I'll ask you if there's anything.

2020-09-28T11:22:37 bentley -> brom
ok

2020-09-28T11:55:13 brom -> bentley
sorry, I can't get into the virtuals (general)

2020-09-28T11:56:07 bentley -> brom
why?

2020-09-28T11:56:10 bentley -> brom
What's the mistake?

2020-09-28T11:59:30 brom -> bentley
I came out of virtualis today, 173.232.146.236 Apache2 Debian comes out and that's it

2020-09-28T12:00:49 bentley -> brom
Weird

2020-09-28T12:00:56 bentley -> brom
And when does this error appear?

2020-09-28T12:01:20 brom -> bentley
Apache2 goes out and won't let you go anywhere

2020-09-28T12:01:35 bentley -> brom

2020-09-28T12:01:56 brom -> bentley
on the moba I connect, there win7 is updating now 146 out of 164 updates

2020-09-28T12:02:13 bentley -> brom
Well then wait until it is updated.

2020-09-28T12:03:04 brom -> bentley
Vin 7 has eaten up resources ?

2020-09-28T12:03:13 bentley -> brom
I don't think so.

2020-09-28T12:05:15 brom -> bentley

Okay

2020-09-28T12:24:39 bentley -> brom

2020-09-28T12:25:03 brom -> bentley
Okay, I'll run it first, check it and then delete it.

2020-09-28T12:25:10 bentley -> brom

Look. We will have 2 types of files for testing. BK loader = resident loader and trike

2020-09-28T12:30:40 bentley -> brom
So far, I have.

2020-09-28T12:30:54 brom -> bentley

2020-09-28T14:02:45 bentley -> brom
No you run the exe itself from the link on the machines. VM

2020-09-28T14:02:59 bentley -> brom
And you look in the admin area through tor on your work computer

2020-09-28T14:03:27 brom -> bentley
Yes, that's right.

2020-09-28T14:04:34 brom -> bentley

You can do it yourself there is a rollback in the admin panel

2020-09-29T06:41:40 brom -> bentley
No snapshot on it, didn't do it before the update, and it broke on the update.

2020-09-29T06:42:14 bentley -> brom
Jeez

2020-09-29T06:42:21 bentley -> brom
Okay, tell Greene he can fix it.

ip scored 173.232.146.236 all dead status?

2020-09-29T10:00:55 bentley -> brom
Why go into the dashboard?

2020-09-29T10:02:04 brom -> bentley
so that you can see where the bot taps (Go to the admin panel under the role of the operator who has access to the group of this bot), maybe I misunderstand

2020-09-29T10:02:42 brom -> bentley
I'm in the bots tab.

2020-09-29T10:03:22 bentley -> brom
Yes tabs bots

2020-09-29T10:03:38 bentley -> brom
There you are looking for a bot with an IP or with the name of a car

2020-09-29T10:13:10 brom -> bentley
I can see my machine from the office by static ip, I need it from vm-c I can only see the local one

2020-09-29T10:13:53 brom -> bentley
tracert gave me some checks against what is displayed there

2020-09-29T10:41:07 brom -> bentley
There are 40 machines on one IP (domain) apparently

2020-09-29T10:42:08 bentley -> brom

judging by the dates of the last activity from my machine bot was not active from vm with the host address where it is installed (173.232.146.236) looked

2020-09-29T11:01:14 brom -> bentley
I figured it out, I need to start the panel with VM, then it will be displayed

2020-09-29T11:01:20 brom -> bentley
right?

2020-09-29T11:01:38 bentley -> brom
So what machine did you run it on?

2020-09-29T11:02:10 brom -> bentley
today?

2020-09-29T11:02:37 bentley -> brom
Yep

2020-09-29T11:03:23 brom -> bentley
Generally on this 5.17. but I have everything disabled in terms of sending

2020-09-29T11:03:48 brom -> bentley

2020-09-29T11:06:38 brom -> bentley
I understand that it is no longer relevant.

2020-09-29T11:08:32 bentley -> brom
So let's go again on what machine did you run the tet echo on?

2020-09-29T11:09:19 brom -> bentley
5.17.161.235 -this is the machine I am writing from (this is an external stat)

2020-09-29T11:09:27 bentley -> brom
Yep

2020-09-29T11:09:41 brom -> bentley
win10 disabled everything beforehand

2020-09-29T11:09:41 bentley -> brom
What is the IP inside the virtual machine?

2020-09-29T11:10:26 brom -> bentley
local vm address?

2020-09-29T11:11:03 bentley -> brom
on vm you can go to 2ip.ru

2020-09-29T11:12:24 brom -> bentley
10.0.2.15 external 173.232.146.236 by ip2.ru

2020-09-29T11:12:45 bentley -> brom
173.232.146.236 that's what you should look for in the admin panel

2020-09-29T11:13:22 bentley -> brom
Also look at the computer name

2020-09-29T11:13:54 brom -> bentley
ok, and the name in MD-57

2020-09-29T11:13:59 brom -> bentley

2020-09-29T11:14:13 bentley -> brom
not just in the properties of the computer I'm looking at

2020-09-29T11:48:10 brom -> bentley

2020-09-29T12:39:57 bentley -> brom
So

2020-09-29T12:40:04 bentley -> brom
What's your stage right now?

2020-09-29T12:42:57 brom -> bentley
I guess the first one

2020-09-29T12:43:27 brom -> bentley
all the rest was setting the stage

2020-09-29T12:50:05 bentley -> brom
And more details.

2020-09-29T12:59:53 brom -> bentley
Got it. 1)Getting access to system resources (login-password), 2)Setting up the VM workstation with the given parameters (blocking sending messages from AB and system and defender updates).            3) Creating a snapshot of the system. 4) Studying the instructions for the researcher's quick start + safety and work with the BC.                                                                      5) Studying the theoretical part of AB operation.

2020-09-29T16:02:17 brom -> bentley
The point is kind of clear just to do it sequentially according to the plan.

2020-09-29T16:02:20 bentley -> brom
No screenshots needed. You don't need to look at the logs, just to make sure the startup is running

2020-09-29T16:03:06 brom -> bentley
 For example, pscp.exe. in the instructions is an example file in the package?

2020-09-29T16:03:14 bentley -> brom
yes

2020-09-29T16:03:19 bentley -> brom
we have a different file

2020-09-29T16:03:30 brom -> bentley
Ok. this is a clear example.

2020-09-29T16:05:57 brom -> bentley
enter hostname? date /t commands is when running a .bat file (there is one batch file 1.bat-this is what to do with it)

2020-09-29T16:06:13 bentley -> brom

2020-09-29T16:06:36 brom -> bentley

Need a quick test with a fix

2020-09-30T07:56:08 brom -> bentley
how do you understand that?

2020-09-30T07:57:48 bentley -> brom
This means that the loader is fixed in the system. It will survive reboot. Check it this way: start it, wait for reboot, make a request for Get system info. When it worked, restart your computer via startup and wait for another crash and make Get Sysinfo request. When everything is ok - the test is finished.

2020-09-30T07:58:01 bentley -> brom
After restarting on vm, check that there is no detection

2020-09-30T07:58:44 brom -> bentley
Okay, got it. I'm on it.

2020-09-30T07:59:36 bentley -> brom

2020-09-30T07:59:43 bentley -> brom
in Groups

2020-09-30T08:05:01 brom -> bentley
When you run it on (from admin) the VM did not ask for confirmation like yesterday

2020-09-30T08:06:03 bentley -> brom
Right. You will have for tests group 4 54 55

2020-09-30T08:06:43 brom -> bentley
it's WIN

2020-09-30T08:07:04 bentley -> brom

2020-09-30T15:04:59 bentley -> brom
Roll back to a clean setup then and make a new snap

2020-09-30T15:05:26 brom -> bentley
there last loeder ran fine as a clean one

2020-09-30T15:06:02 bentley -> brom
You don't want to always have a clean, updated snapshot to roll back to after work

2020-09-30T15:08:01 brom -> bentley
ok

2020-09-30T15:28:40 brom -> bentley

2020-09-30T19:16:49 bentley -> brom
OK

2020-09-30T19:18:46 brom -> bentley
do you have to delete today's bot from the machines?

2020-09-30T19:20:03 brom -> bentley
I don't understand everything about how they work

2020-09-30T19:21:00 bentley -> brom
Yes do a recovery from a clean snap

2020-09-30T19:21:47 brom -> bentley
ok

2020-09-30T19:22:17 brom -> bentley
I'll do a little update later tomorrow.

2020-09-30T19:24:00 brom -> bentley
and this bot should survive the reboot?

2020-09-30T19:26:05 bentley -> brom
yes

2020-09-30T19:26:26 brom -> bentley
ok

2020-09-30T19:34:58 brom -> bentley
I will work tomorrow from a different machine

2020-09-30T19:35:41 bentley -> brom
okay

2020-09-30T19:36:57 brom -> bentley
I delete everything from this one so the admin can't watch remotely

2020-09-30T19:37:10 bentley -> brom
))

2020-09-30T19:37:17 bentley -> brom
You'd better roll back to pure snap

2020-09-30T19:38:01 brom -> bentley
I can't do my OS, only yours.

2020-09-30T19:38:24 bentley -> brom
here about them )

2020-09-30T19:38:58 brom -> bentley
By the way, a thought, on Friday I will try to work from a virtual machine, it is quite a powerful computer

2020-09-30T19:39:21 brom -> bentley
on your own

2020-09-30T19:39:54 bentley -> brom
good idea )

2020-09-30T19:40:51 brom -> bentley
Yes tomorrow, i'll report back later (i'll write back). Maybe vin 7 will be able to test it today.

2020-09-30T19:41:19 bentley -> brom
okie dokie )

2020-09-30T19:48:37 brom -> bentley
What can I say, dr4 is dirty my home system recognizes it as a file, and as a critical action (sending is disabled) one drive among others - when copied it recognized

2020-09-30T19:49:37 brom -> bentley
as a threat, but the bot works in the process maybe panic for nothing?

2020-09-30T19:50:07 bentley -> brom
Where did you run BC?

2020-09-30T19:50:26 brom -> bentley
She says no action required, she's not working in her office.

2020-09-30T19:51:07 bentley -> brom
I don't quite understand you, did you run the exe on your machine?

2020-09-30T19:51:42 brom -> bentley
no that's the point, just copied the folder with it (unzipped)

2020-09-30T19:52:09 brom -> bentley
Anyway, I accidentally found out

2020-09-30T19:52:37 brom -> bentley
Maybe they give out some kind of signatures?

2020-09-30T19:53:36 bentley -> brom
yes it can

2020-09-30T19:54:14 bentley -> brom
didn't run it?

2020-09-30T19:55:16 brom -> bentley
try to copy it to yourself, I do not have win10-64 at home, I have not run it, why should I bother with it later

2020-09-30T19:55:47 brom -> bentley
Looking for which build I have

2020-09-30T19:55:52 bentley -> brom
didn't you run the bk on your car yourself on vm? Accidentally maybe?

2020-09-30T19:55:59 bentley -> brom
No need to run

2020-09-30T19:56:03 bentley -> brom
not in any way

2020-09-30T19:56:23 brom -> bentley
You have to use tor, right?

2020-09-30T19:56:47 brom -> bentley
No, I didn't.

2020-09-30T19:57:58 brom -> bentley
I write in advance which car I will be from.  No one has access there )

I start the machine and haven't opened anything yet, and here it is

2020-10-05T14:45:15 bentley -> brom
Apparently someone has been testing the ipv6 protocol

2020-10-05T14:46:16 brom -> bentley
Okay, the main thing is that there is no reason to worry.

2020-10-05T16:00:52 bentley -> brom

2020-10-05T16:01:10 brom -> bentley
So a different setting (bait)?

2020-10-05T16:01:25 bentley -> brom
No, you can just mark the bot as a Honeypot

2020-10-05T16:01:44 brom -> bentley
Who's baiting him then?

2020-10-05T16:02:22 bentley -> brom

2020-10-06T09:48:30 brom -> bentley
Is there a serious problem there?

2020-10-06T09:50:24 bentley -> brom
Well that's more for coders of course. Our task is to check whether it works or not.

2020-10-06T09:51:31 brom -> bentley
ok, just where can the result be confirmed (passing the test) or just displaying messages on the screen?

2020-10-06T09:53:37 bentley -> brom

Great. ok.

2020-10-06T15:51:53 brom -> bentley

For some reason my VMs are in testbot group 7 and not 4

2020-10-06T18:55:09 bentley -> brom
make a request because a bot from the previous group will pull up

2020-10-06T18:55:14 bentley -> brom

Hi, Cactus dropped off a build for group 6

2020-10-13T07:36:08 bentley -> brom
Okay

2020-10-13T07:36:33 bentley -> brom
Work according to the algorithm as I wrote

2020-10-13T07:36:46 brom -> bentley
I specified the version of the loeder in the admin area as 012

2020-10-13T07:37:03 bentley -> brom
How did he have it right?

2020-10-13T07:37:23 brom -> bentley
unclear

2020-10-13T07:38:10 bentley -> brom
When he sent you the build, what version were the files?

2020-10-13T07:38:16 brom -> bentley
b7Mx#n9%hNAk2BdO

2020-10-13T07:38:20 brom -> bentley

2020-10-13T07:38:33 bentley -> brom
I see the names of the files

2020-10-13T07:39:04 bentley -> brom
There is a version in the file name

2020-10-13T07:39:14 bentley -> brom
Or ask him for a proxy.

2020-10-13T07:41:15 brom -> bentley

Yes

2020-10-13T07:43:43 brom -> bentley

2020-10-13T07:43:51 bentley -> brom
Pour the backdo into the tabs of the bot 64

2020-10-13T07:43:58 bentley -> brom
doader in tab loader 64

2020-10-13T07:44:02 bentley -> brom
and then tethers on.

2020-10-13T07:50:41 brom -> bentley
I went to group 6, download the backdoor (the one with the password) to my machine and load it from there - there's a line crypttest6.exe version 012 should I do that and run the same one on a VM?

2020-10-13T07:51:36 bentley -> brom
gjlj;lb.

2020-10-13T07:51:38 bentley -> brom
Stop

2020-10-13T07:51:49 bentley -> brom

2020-10-13T07:51:54 brom -> bentley
got it where Botx64 , and the loader

2020-10-13T07:52:00 brom -> bentley

2020-10-13T07:52:10 bentley -> brom

2020-10-13T08:06:19 bentley -> brom
please wait I need a distraction

2020-10-13T08:06:48 brom -> bentley

lf

2020-10-13T09:00:22 bentley -> brom
Figured out what to pour into the admin line BC and with what version?

2020-10-13T09:00:57 brom -> bentley
Cactus explained a little, now running on VM, running tests

2020-10-13T09:01:54 brom -> bentley
With staged I don't know what to pour

2020-10-13T09:02:40 bentley -> brom
Same as in production. 1 file for both.

2020-10-13T09:02:52 bentley -> brom
is it clear what to pour where with the sobot and the loader?

2020-10-13T09:03:23 brom -> bentley
that's right in group 6 in their fields

2020-10-13T09:45:36 brom -> bentley
in the Cookies Names field do you need to enter something? in group 6

2020-10-13T09:46:04 bentley -> brom
no

2020-10-13T09:46:44 brom -> bentley
Go simple?

2020-10-13T09:47:12 bentley -> brom
yes poured bot 64 and loader 64 in both fields staging and production?

2020-10-13T09:48:37 brom -> bentley
No only production

2020-10-13T09:48:51 bentley -> brom
What about staging?

2020-10-13T09:48:59 bentley -> brom
Or when are you going to give it away?

2020-10-13T09:49:25 brom -> bentley
there is bot6.ver010.exe and I was given ver012

2020-10-13T09:49:49 bentley -> brom
overlay it and change the version

2020-10-13T09:50:18 brom -> bentley
ok

2020-10-13T09:52:36 brom -> bentley
I clarify, where Staged on the left crypttest6.exe I load the loader there? it is easier with the bot

2020-10-13T09:54:24 bentley -> brom
Yes, in place of the last Lowder.

2020-10-13T09:54:39 brom -> bentley
ok

2020-10-13T09:55:07 bentley -> brom
The bot has version ver010 ?

2020-10-13T09:55:17 brom -> bentley
yes

2020-10-13T09:55:40 bentley -> brom
Okay

2020-10-13T12:31:46 brom -> bentley

marsel@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion

2020-10-13T13:23:55 brom -> bentley
check with Bentley, maybe through a file exchange, or maybe there is his own system (you need to send Marcel) he needs files for crypto, from the folder Loader_X64 - exeşnik, dll and icon

2020-10-13T13:24:06 brom -> bentley
how to make?

2020-10-13T13:24:52 bentley -> brom
Send the dll and ask to make a crypt echo with a pdf icon via file sharing in an archive with a password

2020-10-13T13:25:33 brom -> bentley
how to send it to him? (via what)

2020-10-13T13:26:07 brom -> bentley
via jaber?

2020-10-13T13:26:46 bentley -> brom
Archive with the rar password and download qaz.im

2020-10-13T13:27:02 bentley -> brom
There and send him two links to dovnload and delate

2020-10-13T13:35:24 brom -> bentley

2020-10-13T14:36:45 brom -> bentley
?

2020-10-13T14:36:57 bentley -> brom
Yes with vm to run autotests

2020-10-13T14:37:23 brom -> bentley
ok, is it just a static or dynamic process display?

2020-10-13T14:37:43 bentley -> brom
Don't do the dynamics, run the statics.

2020-10-13T14:38:18 brom -> bentley
I'll try with the ones already uploaded?

2020-10-13T14:38:37 bentley -> brom
Wait until you get crypted.

2020-10-13T14:38:46 bentley -> brom

And there is a list of cars with a slider and at the bottom the type of test - New BK

2020-10-13T14:44:36 brom -> bentley
and on the list-understood, run a new bk first?

2020-10-13T14:45:46 brom -> bentley
Or set it and run it-let it test it?

2020-10-13T14:50:14 brom -> bentley
Bug 1 has already popped up

2020-10-13T14:58:00 bentley -> brom
you can run a non-bk autotest and a stoic at the same time

2020-10-13T15:08:28 brom -> bentley
