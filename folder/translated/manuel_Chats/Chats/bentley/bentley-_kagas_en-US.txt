Hi

2020-07-15T16:50:30 kagas -> bentley
I haven't fixed anything yet, well, I'm going to do the fixing.

2020-07-15T16:50:36 kagas -> bentley
When they show you how to do everything

2020-07-15T16:50:42 kagas -> bentley
Haven't done it yet.

2020-07-15T16:50:43 kagas -> bentley
Why?

2020-07-15T16:50:55 bentley -> kagas
Stern asked who we have fixing

2020-07-15T16:51:37 kagas -> bentley
Didn't Target write you that you had to show me something or something like that

2020-07-15T16:52:11 bentley -> kagas
He wrote, but I never understood what he wanted. Because I did not use the dll for cramming.

2020-07-15T16:57:33 kagas -> bentley
And you didn't do the fixing at all, did you?

2020-07-15T16:57:46 bentley -> kagas
Not even once

2020-07-15T16:57:54 kagas -> bentley
