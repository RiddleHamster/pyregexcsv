figure it all out.

2020-07-03T10:23:32 bentley -> stern
Hi

2020-07-03T10:23:41 stern -> bentley
and show a list of servers with a description of which one is used where

2020-07-03T10:24:36 bentley -> stern
Yes I'm on topic. The issue there is exactly that they are corp antiviruses. And what he used to buy from you is the home part.

2020-07-03T10:26:02 bentley -> stern
So we have autotests set up. On corporate antiviruses. Yeset, BitDefender, Sophos, Trend Micro, Macafe, Sumantec, Avast, Webroot.

2020-07-03T10:26:18 stern -> bentley
Are you testing the uk or the trike

2020-07-03T10:26:20 stern -> bentley
Or any software

2020-07-03T10:26:55 bentley -> stern
It was originally under BC. But now it works for any software. Buza wrote autotests for BC, Trick, and any software.

2020-07-03T10:28:54 bentley -> stern
173.232.146.236:31001 This is where Yeset is located. License not purchased.

2020-07-03T10:29:22 bentley -> stern
173.232.146.236:31002 Битдефендер. License purchased.

2020-07-03T10:29:53 bentley -> stern
173.232.146.236:31003 Sophos. The license is not purchased.

2020-07-03T10:30:25 bentley -> stern
173.232.146.236:31004 Trend Micro. License purchased.

2020-07-03T10:30:42 bentley -> stern
173.232.146.236:31005 Macafe. License purchased.

2020-07-03T10:30:57 bentley -> stern
173.232.146.236:31006 Сумантек. License not purchased

2020-07-03T10:31:10 bentley -> stern

2020-07-03T10:31:21 bentley -> stern
173.232.146.236:31008 Webroot. License not purchased.

2020-07-03T10:32:23 bentley -> stern
Carter bought some of the corp licenses since the last buyout. It was the root versions of AV Set, Norton, Sophos, Trend Micro, Webroot that got stuck.

2020-07-03T10:33:32 bentley -> stern
Because they work differently than home ones. More serious protection. We need them primarily for the new BC. To develop and test BCs against corporations and big businesses

2020-07-08T18:42:12 bentley -> stern
It does. But much less often. And crypts live for almost 24 hours. Worked with yesterday's crypt today and it knocked well.

Bk is out today and Hof is gone. BK has a gasket that lay in the middle. Can't give BK to Paul. Both Tilar, Balzac, and Derek have the usual Tric crypts. Tried crypting with Deploy last build - it sticks on dynamics.

2020-08-17T10:37:03 stern -> bentley

2020-08-17T10:38:35 bentley -> stern
Cactus also. Mashroom BC - Balzac, Swift - Paul and Cactus - Derek are in the works right now.

2020-08-17T10:38:54 bentley -> stern

2020-08-17T10:39:03 bentley -> stern

2020-08-20T16:05:14 stern -> bentley
We need an automation to check the functionality of the box

2020-08-20T16:05:25 stern -> bentley
so you don't check manually, but with scripts and admin

2020-08-20T16:05:33 stern -> bentley
I take it it takes you 70-80 percent of your work time?

2020-08-20T16:08:57 bentley -> stern
Yes. That's the way it works here. Booza did autotests they check the BC on the corp AV. But when they give out a fresh build of BC for crypt I run it completely. If the next day we crypt yesterday's build, there is no need to run the full test manually.

2020-08-20T16:09:57 bentley -> stern
Autotests are not stable right now, so I have to run them manually. Not stable because not all coders are accounted for and Buza is on vacation to fix it

2020-08-20T16:10:25 stern -> bentley

2020-08-20T16:13:28 stern -> bentley

2020-08-20T16:14:04 bentley -> stern
That's what we do.

2020-08-20T16:15:27 stern -> bentley
Since bk is constantly being reworked in the cleanup process

2020-08-20T16:15:31 stern -> bentley
and some of the functionality can fall off

2020-08-20T16:15:35 stern -> bentley
And you'll have to keep checking it all the time.

2020-08-20T16:15:38 stern -> bentley
better to do it automatically

2020-08-20T16:15:44 stern -> bentley
since there are already 8 bk's from different coders

2020-08-20T16:15:46 stern -> bentley

2020-08-31T17:48:16 bentley -> stern
Yes. Got it. Ready 4 groups like he asked. He says we'll start on Wednesday.

2020-08-31T17:48:44 stern -> bentley
Are they clean and working?

2020-08-31T17:48:52 stern -> bentley

2020-08-31T17:51:14 bentley -> stern
Let me get this straight.

2020-08-31T18:08:59 bentley -> stern
That's not what I wrote off on the loafer crypts for Target. There have been detections on Defender since Friday. On corp av all was clear. Today as they started building a build with no detects, according to Van. The server stopped working. Buza came in and set up the signatures. Went out of time for Target. Will run a fresh crypt on av.

2020-08-31T18:14:16 stern -> bentley
ok

2020-08-31T18:14:20 stern -> bentley
Is the corp av clear?

2020-08-31T18:14:29 bentley -> stern
It was.

2020-08-31T18:14:40 stern -> bentley
ok

2020-08-31T18:15:13 stern -> bentley
target says his screenshot checker is dirty, check it, and if so we need to rewrite our autocheckers. Give booze a description.

2020-08-31T18:15:24 bentley -> stern
I see.

2020-08-31T18:15:35 bentley -> stern
Will do.

2020-09-02T12:38:07 stern -> bentley
Hi

2020-09-02T12:38:11 stern -> bentley
What's the real targeting there

2020-09-02T12:38:55 bentley -> stern
Hi. On Defender, the BKs from Mashroom and Van are straying. They're redoing it. Checking another build from Frog right now.

2020-09-02T12:42:19 stern -> bentley
Why didn't they redo it sooner?

2020-09-02T12:42:25 stern -> bentley
Why does it stink?

2020-09-02T12:42:29 stern -> bentley
And why does he say he's dirty?

2020-09-02T12:42:31 stern -> bentley
not you

2020-09-02T12:42:38 stern -> bentley
with a Revan

2020-09-02T12:43:27 bentley -> stern
It used to work a full lap on Def and it didn't stink.

2020-09-02T12:43:44 stern -> bentley
and before giving it out to the target

2020-09-02T12:43:46 stern -> bentley
on the tether

2020-09-02T12:43:47 stern -> bentley
on test

2020-09-02T12:43:53 stern -> bentley
Why didn't you find the problem

2020-09-02T12:43:55 stern -> bentley
and he

2020-09-02T12:45:35 bentley -> stern
It didn't sting me.  I've been testing autotest + by hand. Will still be testing from the link as it is.

2020-09-02T12:46:22 stern -> bentley
And why on the rest of the avs

2020-09-02T12:46:23 stern -> bentley
did you find out

2020-09-02T12:46:26 stern -> bentley
that the avs don't work

2020-09-02T12:46:30 stern -> bentley
only when the target wrote to you

2020-09-02T12:49:07 bentley -> stern
I had no detects on other AVs before the issue. And now the file is clean on Sumantky, Sophos, Trend Micro, Webroot, Macafe. According to our autotest. It downloads the file from the link. Our autotest downloads from the cryptopanel with a script.

2020-09-02T12:49:37 stern -> bentley
bouza says these avs are broken

2020-09-02T12:49:47 stern -> bentley
and you've rolled some temporary faces

2020-09-02T12:50:18 bentley -> stern
No temps are only on eset and sofos.

2020-09-02T12:50:25 bentley -> stern
On others, they are permanent.

2020-09-02T12:52:51 stern -> bentley
were they standing before the target wrote that they had palits on them?

2020-09-02T12:53:23 bentley -> stern
No, I made the time card yesterday.

2020-09-02T12:53:39 stern -> bentley
Why weren't they standing before that?

2020-09-02T12:54:11 bentley -> stern
I missed the point when the temporary license expired.

2020-09-02T12:57:17 stern -> bentley
this shouldn't happen again, the target shouldn't poke problems anymore

2020-09-02T12:57:45 bentley -> stern
I get it. I stand corrected.

2020-09-16T13:39:11 stern -> bentley
or not crypto

2020-09-16T13:39:41 bentley -> stern
In the evening - krypt

2020-09-16T15:46:38 stern -> bentley
Hi

2020-09-16T15:46:40 stern -> bentley

[16:13:52] <target> so far all they give
[16:13:53] <target> sources
[16:13:56] <target> one second bk
[16:14:00] <target> all dirty
[16:14:02] <target> def takes down
[16:14:08] <target> wait more
[16:14:24] <target> give
in a minute I give them report with screenshots
and bentley sees it himself
[16:14:34] <target> wait
[16:31:16] <target> got new
[16:31:17] <target> still the same
[16:31:20] <target> killed by def immediately
[16:31:21] <target> sources
[16:31:23] <target> and krypts

2020-09-16T15:46:42 stern -> bentley
are all the bk's dirty?

2020-09-16T15:46:46 stern -> bentley
not crypto

2020-09-16T15:48:43 bentley -> stern
Van has 5 builds that all stink and Mashroom has 1

2020-09-16T15:53:25 stern -> bentley
has this always been known?

2020-09-16T15:53:55 bentley -> stern
No before that everything was fine yesterday and last week

2020-09-16T15:54:07 stern -> bentley
and how does it check the targeting)

2020-09-16T15:54:11 stern -> bentley
What's he got that's torn down.

2020-09-16T15:54:44 bentley -> stern
Another thing is just a pure defender turntime of the anchorite Target is checked by downloading from the shelves via chrome

2020-09-16T15:55:03 bentley -> stern
It's not exactly rantime and it's not exactly corp av on which we were brushing up

2020-09-16T15:55:38 bentley -> stern
The reputation of the sites and google cloud av are also superimposed into this situation

2020-09-16T15:56:01 stern -> bentley
and you can also clean and check how target does it

2020-09-16T15:56:04 stern -> bentley
Since he's checking that way

2020-09-16T15:56:07 stern -> bentley
So that's how he sends it out.

2020-09-16T15:57:16 bentley -> stern
Yes it is.

2020-09-16T15:58:47 bentley -> stern
Yes we can Only we need more sites from which the mailing is coming

2020-09-16T16:15:24 stern -> bentley

[16:55:55] <target> he has regulations
he doesn't follow it
check 1 time and 10 minutes later check again
[16:56:00] <target> he writes you a report about the first time
[16:56:06] <target> and 10 min later no
[16:56:10] <target> I've noticed it for the hundredth time
[16:56:15] <target> now it's the same situation
[16:56:16] <target> gives the file
[16:56:22] <target> in 10 min it reports everything bad
[16:56:24] <target> and he sees for himself
[16:56:50] <target> we have a full cycle
[16:56:56] <target> it checks for 1 and 2 time after 10 min
[17:01:08] <target> no questions to bentley now
[17:01:12] <target> he gives the file
[17:01:16] <target> we check in 10 min
[17:01:17] <target> him too
[17:01:21] <target> and at the end in 10 min
[17:01:24] <target> we all exchange information

2020-09-16T16:16:47 bentley -> stern
I'm not following the regulations?

2020-09-16T16:18:05 stern -> bentley

check once and after 10 minutes check again

2020-09-16T16:18:07 stern -> bentley
target says

2020-09-16T16:19:58 bentley -> stern
As far as I remember his office is re-posting to new links and there are special people who check. I just uploaded to the links today yesterday uploaded to file sharing and last time too

2020-09-16T16:20:10 bentley -> stern
Well, if that's the way it has to be, I'll check it.

2020-09-16T16:35:38 stern -> bentley

2020-09-17T14:30:23 stern -> bentley

Hi.

2020-09-23T15:11:39 bentley -> stern
Kryptor said no. Says he doesn't have time for a lot of work. Mango is looking for more cryptors.

2020-09-23T15:13:15 bentley -> stern
I want to work with Target even further. On his BC with Mashroom Van and Deploy. + Managing testers. I think I can keep up.

2020-09-23T15:15:27 stern -> bentley
Ok fine

2020-09-23T15:17:16 stern -> bentley
Is he any good ?

2020-09-23T15:17:19 stern -> bentley
I mean the cryptor.

2020-09-23T15:17:23 stern -> bentley
did we geo-test the cryptos?

2020-09-23T15:19:07 bentley -> stern
His statics are clean, but Defender immediately scorched the timing. Didn't give out a clean one.

2020-09-23T16:23:16 stern -> bentley
Check this cryptor again

2020-09-23T16:23:25 stern -> bentley
say the price is 1200 per week we will pay

2020-09-23T16:23:27 stern -> bentley

2020-09-23T16:23:28 stern -> bentley
as before

2020-09-23T16:23:34 stern -> bentley

2020-09-23T21:12:09 stern -> bentley

[21:00:36] <mors> Marcel has a feeling that the crypt is glitchy, not many bots are coming

2020-09-23T21:12:13 stern -> bentley
could that be?

2020-09-24T07:21:20 stern -> bentley

Yes it could be. It could be that it sticks fast.

2020-09-24T11:26:56 bentley -> stern
Def said you would be contacted for your password to https://uibegvz4hxzrqjqc.onion/login. I had a login tt1 - to check the bounce when testing trike.

2020-09-24T16:00:52 bentley -> stern
Tery, hlor and love - got the hang of it quickly and get the job done without stalling. Clear and concise.

2020-09-24T16:01:23 bentley -> stern
idgo and xeon are a bit slower, but they'll do just as well.

2020-09-24T16:01:36 bentley -> stern
And there's 1 new one - brom is just starting to get the hang of it

2020-09-24T16:03:10 bentley -> stern

2020-09-24T18:47:18 bentley -> stern
Every 4-5 hours the Defender database is updated

2020-09-24T18:50:11 stern -> bentley

Stopped knocking at Target in combat. It's knocking on our test ones. Somewhere in there is a glitch. Either in the technology of operation or in the gaskets.

2020-09-29T17:37:31 stern -> bentley
Do you have US gaskets ?

2020-09-29T17:37:41 bentley -> stern
