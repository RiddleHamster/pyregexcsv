2020-09-16T09:05:16 mango -> bentley
no problem

2020-09-16T09:05:18 bentley -> mango
I'll be right out of here, let's get started.)

2020-09-16T09:05:21 mango -> bentley
oceans

2020-09-16T09:06:18 bentley -> mango
For now, ask Buza for access to the BC Admin and Cryptopanel

2020-09-16T09:12:09 bentley -> mango
And also here https://mk6gwg6mwnn6if33.onion

2020-09-16T09:12:15 bentley -> mango
This is where the documentation lives.

2020-09-16T11:35:10 mango -> bentley
bro well i've studied everything, read everything in the documentation, cryptopanel poked, is it purely for cryptors? stubs different to do and test them?

2020-09-16T11:35:24 mango -> bentley
my task is what?

2020-09-16T11:35:38 bentley -> mango
Yeah for the interaction between cryptors and testers

2020-09-16T11:36:09 bentley -> mango
Our task is to test and give out to clients verified BC taken from the encoder and encrypted by the cryptor

2020-09-16T11:36:42 mango -> bentley
Do you need your own machine for this with all the updates or are we going to test it on your virtual machines?

2020-09-16T11:36:54 mango -> bentley
There's a varya, if anything, tuned up.

2020-09-16T11:37:45 mango -> bentley
why the fuck do you need four testers? )))) pay me for three I can test everything myself :)

2020-09-16T11:38:37 bentley -> mango
Ahahaha )

2020-09-16T11:38:40 mango -> bentley
You're used to all kinds of fuck-ups like me jerking off one file for three hours and you're upsetting your budget :)

2020-09-16T11:38:56 bentley -> mango

2020-09-16T11:40:17 mango -> bentley

2020-09-16T11:44:05 bentley -> mango
While we need to make a car where to race the tests

2020-09-16T11:44:58 mango -> bentley

2020-09-16T11:45:21 mango -> bentley
Thought that was it, no use

2020-09-16T11:46:16 bentley -> mango
Great It should be possible to work with snapshots and ideally develop a virtualtools server

2020-09-16T11:46:20 mango -> bentley
there is a home server ready, although not enough RAM, but 2 virtual machines simultaneously pulls. there is a very powerful home server with 32 GB of RAM, I can arrange it under this case

2020-09-16T11:47:17 mango -> bentley
have a couple of macbooks :)

2020-09-16T11:48:07 bentley -> mango
