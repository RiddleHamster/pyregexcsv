I read it, of course there is a lot to work on, the project is grayish)

2020-09-23T12:48:45 bentley -> idgo
What do you mean there is something to work with?

2020-09-23T12:49:12 idgo -> bentley
in terms of testing, and development

2020-09-23T12:49:21 bentley -> idgo
And that's yes )

2020-09-23T12:49:27 bentley -> idgo
Continuous development

2020-09-23T12:55:05 idgo -> bentley
What are my other tasks ? They just didn't really explain anything to me, they just briefly told me testing on the VM

2020-09-23T12:57:20 bentley -> idgo
Basically, it's running the files and checking against the algorithm. Plus communicating with the coder to get the files and send him reports. Also communicating with the cryptor to send the tested build to the crypt. Then testing the crypt. If at this stage there are bugs, then sending reports to crypto and working with it. And at the end - issuing the finished crypto to the partner.

2020-09-23T12:57:28 bentley -> idgo
This is the general algorithm for working

2020-09-23T13:01:24 idgo -> bentley
any organizational details, how long we work when online ?

2020-09-23T13:01:52 bentley -> idgo
Yeah let's get this straight. What time zone are you in?

2020-09-23T13:02:36 idgo -> bentley
+0

2020-09-23T13:02:47 idgo -> bentley
msc

2020-09-23T13:03:48 bentley -> idgo
Okay. We have an 8 hour workday.

2020-09-23T13:04:03 bentley -> idgo
It needs to work until 20-21 Moscow time

2020-09-23T13:06:24 idgo -> bentley
is this a permanent job or for a certain time ?

2020-09-23T13:06:41 bentley -> idgo
Permanent

2020-09-23T13:07:02 idgo -> bentley
super )

2020-09-23T13:07:18 bentley -> idgo
Yep, and possible career advancement.

2020-09-23T13:08:05 idgo -> bentley
Did you originally start out as a tester too ?

2020-09-23T13:08:11 bentley -> idgo
Yep

2020-09-23T13:08:18 bentley -> idgo
over a year ago

2020-09-23T13:08:27 bentley -> idgo
What's the timing that suits you?

2020-09-23T13:10:06 idgo -> bentley
exactly what time does the work day start? just when I saw the topic on xss it said 9 to 18:00

2020-09-23T13:10:21 bentley -> idgo
Well, 9 to 18 doesn't really fit.

2020-09-23T13:10:44 bentley -> idgo
11 to 20-21 that would be better

2020-09-23T13:10:56 idgo -> bentley
ok, super

2020-09-23T13:11:08 bentley -> idgo
Goode

2020-09-23T13:11:17 bentley -> idgo
Are the cars ready for the test?

2020-09-23T13:12:37 idgo -> bentley
Yes, you just need to restore from a snapshot

2020-09-23T13:12:49 bentley -> idgo
Update av

2020-09-23T13:12:59 bentley -> idgo
And make a new snapshot for 10 and 2019

2020-09-23T13:13:13 idgo -> bentley
ok

2020-09-23T13:14:01 bentley -> idgo
The test cycle itself starts with an av update ) Approximately every 4 hours a Defender database update is released

2020-09-23T13:16:39 idgo -> bentley

2020-09-23T13:17:04 bentley -> idgo
as you do run https://qaz.im/load/SZTdaR/2s9tfh

2020-09-23T13:17:06 bentley -> idgo
123

2020-09-23T13:34:10 idgo -> bentley
WIN 10 The Word file did not open in the running processes did not see the name

2020-09-23T13:34:19 idgo -> bentley
is this normal ?

2020-09-23T13:34:43 bentley -> idgo
It's an ecce with a ford icon and you just have to run it

2020-09-23T13:35:17 idgo -> bentley
got it, and the name in the processes with the icon is different right ?

2020-09-23T13:35:29 bentley -> idgo
Yes, look at the bottom of the page.

2020-09-23T13:37:30 idgo -> bentley
win-server also fell into the processes without any problems, the names are also different in the processes

2020-09-23T13:37:44 bentley -> idgo
Yep

2020-09-23T13:38:56 idgo -> bentley
I can't see the indentation in the panel ?

2020-09-23T13:41:02 bentley -> idgo
Nope this is a special bot.

2020-09-23T13:41:11 bentley -> idgo
Regular I'll show you where they knock.

2020-09-23T13:41:56 idgo -> bentley
ok, now can i restore from snapshot ? or no rush

2020-09-23T13:42:20 bentley -> idgo
Tell me your ipi.

2020-09-23T13:48:35 idgo -> bentley
192.168.243.131 if I understand correctly, or you have to use whoer but I'm on a VPN it changes

2020-09-23T13:49:17 bentley -> idgo
Here's what you need to do from the machine where you run the file

2020-09-23T13:49:43 idgo -> bentley
Then wait now.

2020-09-23T13:51:00 idgo -> bentley
192.168.243.129 win 10

2020-09-23T13:51:48 bentley -> idgo
so is it a local ipi?

2020-09-23T13:51:59 bentley -> idgo
Go to 2ip.ru on your car

2020-09-23T13:54:13 idgo -> bentley
108.62.49.149

2020-09-23T13:54:46 bentley -> idgo
seen your cars

2020-09-23T13:55:13 idgo -> bentley
ok

2020-09-23T13:55:38 bentley -> idgo
So the test is ok.

2020-09-23T13:57:07 idgo -> bentley
and in the cryptopanel the builds should be displayed ?

2020-09-23T13:57:45 bentley -> idgo
The cryptopanel is where you exchange files with the cryptotr. There you can also do statics test and autotests

2020-09-23T13:58:12 bentley -> idgo
That's where the files are uploaded by the cryptor when you give it the assembly on the crypt

2020-09-23T13:59:07 idgo -> bentley
got it

2020-09-23T14:24:41 bentley -> idgo
The following file is ready for testing

2020-09-23T14:24:42 bentley -> idgo

2020-09-23T14:24:43 bentley -> idgo
123

2020-09-23T14:25:04 bentley -> idgo
First, you have to roll everything back and always test from a clean snap, so you don't pull tails from the last test

2020-09-23T14:25:18 idgo -> bentley
ok, got it

2020-09-23T14:36:07 idgo -> bentley
win 10 all ok, dropped into processes

2020-09-23T14:37:25 idgo -> bentley

[23:55:15] <bentley> Need a simple test with a fix

2020-10-02T17:05:19 idgo -> bentley
to the processes in paly without problems, but in the admin panel did not rebound

2020-10-02T17:06:46 idgo -> bentley
is it supposed to be like this ?

2020-10-02T17:06:57 bentley -> idgo
How long have you been waiting?

2020-10-02T17:07:08 idgo -> bentley
5 min

2020-10-02T17:07:33 bentley -> idgo
the oscillation can be up to 20 minutes

2020-10-02T17:31:42 idgo -> bentley
didn't bounce

2020-10-02T17:32:37 bentley -> idgo
strange, but did it bang on the last test?

2020-10-02T17:33:05 idgo -> bentley
I'll try again, roll it back and report back

2020-10-02T17:33:12 bentley -> idgo
go to

2020-10-02T17:55:10 idgo -> bentley
strange now only tapped 10 https://scrytnuuszglaugg.onion:4247/honeypots/command?id=77f02e7e4647ccc34c10d5d4877456f8

2020-10-02T17:55:47 bentley -> idgo
wow! how long have you waited?

2020-10-02T17:56:06 idgo -> bentley
10 min

2020-10-02T17:56:31 idgo -> bentley
commands to run ?

2020-10-02T17:56:47 bentley -> idgo
do a simple test with a fixer-upper

2020-10-02T17:57:53 idgo -> bentley
just test is hetinfo, kalk, dll, bat, paver shell ?

2020-10-02T17:58:26 bentley -> idgo
simple is the bot bot sucks the get info - restart - restart and get info

2020-10-02T18:19:09 idgo -> bentley
with the server try again ?

2020-10-02T18:19:26 bentley -> idgo
yes

2020-10-02T18:19:32 bentley -> idgo
Is 10 okay?

2020-10-02T18:19:36 idgo -> bentley
yes

2020-10-02T18:19:37 bentley -> idgo
reset settlements

2020-10-02T18:19:48 idgo -> bentley
yes

2020-10-02T18:20:06 bentley -> idgo
Okay

2020-10-02T18:20:16 bentley -> idgo
Check out the server and 7

2020-10-02T18:20:26 idgo -> bentley
ok

2020-10-02T18:34:23 idgo -> bentley
Server crashes into processes and stays there, no action in admin panel. 7 falls in the process after which it disappears from the processes, but also in the panel does not knock

2020-10-02T18:34:39 bentley -> idgo
How long have you been waiting?

2020-10-02T18:35:04 idgo -> bentley
10 min

2020-10-02T18:35:20 bentley -> idgo
wait

2020-10-02T18:36:31 idgo -> bentley
on what factors does the cutoff depend?

2020-10-02T18:36:58 bentley -> idgo
swizzle with adnka basically. The workability of the pads

2020-10-02T18:38:01 idgo -> bentley
If this build knocked before, why doesn't it knock now, or has the build been rebuilt and modified?

2020-10-02T18:38:37 bentley -> idgo
build rebuilt + different rolls and they may die over time

2020-10-02T18:38:54 bentley -> idgo
the lauder goes through the pads one by one if 1 is not available

2020-10-02T18:38:59 bentley -> idgo
And it takes time

2020-10-02T18:39:25 idgo -> bentley
Got it, on average you have to wait 20 minutes ?

2020-10-02T18:39:43 bentley -> idgo
It also happens to knock with another group and in another tab: honeypots tbots

2020-10-02T18:39:47 bentley -> idgo
yes

2020-10-02T18:42:38 idgo -> bentley
I always go through all the tabs, sometimes I noticed that not all data is pulled up, even other IPs, but after goetinfo everything falls into place

2020-10-02T18:43:39 bentley -> idgo
yes

2020-10-02T18:49:49 idgo -> bentley
The panel never bumped.

2020-10-02T18:50:13 bentley -> idgo
hmmm...

2020-10-02T18:50:19 bentley -> idgo

So. You will have a BC 56 working group.
Your duties will include getting the sources from the coder. Pouring them into the admin testing. Crypting. Checking crypt and issuing crypt to partner.
Now I will give you a general scheme of work and then we'll go over the details.
You start the day by upgrading working machines.
Then you run autotest on assemblies that you have in your work and for which there is source code. See if there are any detects and what kind of detection.
Sources run on autotests, i.e. on VM in the cryptopanel.  And there already on the situation if something new - we write to the coder.
If everything is ok - this stage is complete.
Next partner orders a file. Or files.  If he asks for a crypto - give checked source file to crypto and check received crypto in autotest panel. Crypt additionally check manually on 10 2019 7 fast zap test with reload. Nothing should be detected and there should be a knockout.
If there is a detection on a crypt, write to the cryptor and it will redo the build.
Give clean, checked assembly to partner.
Toads of coder and cryptor:
marsel@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion - cryptor
kaktus@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion - coder from whom we take the sources.

2020-10-12T11:37:48 idgo -> bentley
I hope to go through the whole procedure with you, in general +- understandable

2020-10-12T11:38:07 bentley -> idgo
Okay, let's start one step at a time.

2020-10-12T11:38:12 bentley -> idgo
Is the VM ready to go?

2020-10-12T11:38:16 idgo -> bentley
yes

2020-10-12T11:39:00 bentley -> idgo
Great

2020-10-12T11:39:23 bentley -> idgo
Now write to the coder, Cactus, and ask him to make you a build for group 56

2020-10-12T11:57:15 idgo -> bentley
He doesn't answer right away?

2020-10-12T11:57:29 bentley -> idgo
Yes after a while

2020-10-12T13:14:08 bentley -> idgo
Did you get the file?

2020-10-12T13:14:39 idgo -> bentley
not yet

2020-10-12T13:14:52 bentley -> idgo
Has the coder responded?

2020-10-12T13:15:27 idgo -> bentley

2020-10-13T09:20:15 idgo -> bentley
run on their VMs ?

2020-10-13T09:20:35 bentley -> idgo
Yes. 1 time at receipt on their VMs.

2020-10-13T09:21:41 idgo -> bentley
test run or just a tap in the BC ?

2020-10-13T09:22:11 bentley -> idgo
First, run the full test + fix

2020-10-13T09:22:35 bentley -> idgo

2020-10-13T10:10:38 bentley -> idgo
Run it through the atotests now

2020-10-13T10:11:52 idgo -> bentley
how you can input ) into a cryptopanel like

2020-10-13T10:12:10 bentley -> idgo
Don't you have a cryptopanel doc?

2020-10-13T10:12:40 idgo -> bentley
there's

2020-10-13T10:13:12 bentley -> idgo
Check it out and then I'll tell you where to start

2020-10-13T10:13:34 idgo -> bentley
ok, rollbacks can be done on VMs ?

2020-10-13T10:14:27 bentley -> idgo
In autotests, they roll back the script with an avomat

2020-10-13T10:14:32 bentley -> idgo
You can do it from the slicer.

Ask him what he wants crypto and whether he wants the source?

2020-10-13T10:20:22 idgo -> bentley
[13:18:46] <idgo> do you need crypt or source ?

2020-10-13T11:34:46 bentley -> idgo
Look. We tested the source code, right?

2020-10-13T11:35:12 idgo -> bentley
On my VMs yes

2020-10-13T11:35:12 bentley -> idgo
Now we need to order a crite from a cryptor

2020-10-13T11:35:19 bentley -> idgo
Yeah ok

2020-10-13T11:36:03 idgo -> bentley

" [14:35:13] <bentley> Now I have to order a crypto
send archive to cryptor and ask for a crypt ?

2020-10-13T11:37:02 bentley -> idgo
Yes, with the password you knock on the cryptor and ask it to crypt the uk

2020-10-13T11:37:07 bentley -> idgo
Do you have a marcel?

2020-10-13T11:37:21 idgo -> bentley
yes

2020-10-13T11:37:36 bentley -> idgo
Here, order a crypt from him.

2020-10-13T11:37:41 bentley -> idgo
And waiting for the crypto

2020-10-13T11:38:47 idgo -> bentley
Look, I understand correctly, I throw the archive that gave the coder with those passes to the cryptor and ask to make a crypt ?

2020-10-13T11:39:17 bentley -> idgo
No

2020-10-13T11:39:29 bentley -> idgo
We only need to crypt loader 64 and there are more files

what should i do with bob ? he asked for the source

2020-10-13T11:42:42 bentley -> idgo
Give him the source code of the same loeder as you sent to Marcel

2020-10-13T11:42:52 bentley -> idgo
Directly duplicate the link with the password

2020-10-13T13:50:46 idgo -> bentley

so run the staic test and the vm test there

2020-10-13T13:53:45 bentley -> idgo
Plus a quick manual test with reboot - check whether or not the crypt tears down after the bounce

2020-10-13T13:55:52 idgo -> bentley
In the cryptopanel you can run statics and vm at the same time ?

2020-10-13T13:56:01 bentley -> idgo
Yes

2020-10-13T13:56:08 bentley -> idgo
just don't run the speaker

2020-10-13T13:58:04 idgo -> bentley
which vm to choose in the cryptopanel?

2020-10-13T14:04:25 bentley -> idgo

Hi

2020-10-14T08:12:17 bentley -> idgo
Ask crypt or source

2020-10-14T08:23:18 idgo -> bentley
say both

2020-10-14T08:23:25 idgo -> bentley
says*

2020-10-14T08:24:22 bentley -> idgo
Ok test the source code to see if it works. If ok, give it away and make a crypt another yu cryptor

2020-10-14T08:24:48 idgo -> bentley
which source, or order from the coder again

2020-10-14T08:24:52 idgo -> bentley
?

2020-10-14T08:25:06 bentley -> idgo
No the one he sent yesterday.

2020-10-14T08:25:20 bentley -> idgo
Every day you have to check the source code in the morning to make sure it works.

2020-10-14T08:25:33 bentley -> idgo
If it does not work or detects it, write to the coder to redo it

2020-10-14T08:26:36 bentley -> idgo
Also, be sure to run the source every day on autotests on the corp av

2020-10-14T08:26:47 bentley -> idgo
Este, Macafe, Norton, etc.

2020-10-14T08:27:48 idgo -> bentley
got it\

2020-10-14T08:29:30 idgo -> bentley
Loader_X64 correct, same as yesterday

2020-10-14T08:29:30 idgo -> bentley
?

2020-10-14T08:29:57 bentley -> idgo
That's right

2020-10-14T11:08:15 idgo -> bentley
on vin 10 defender burned the source

2020-10-14T11:10:30 idgo -> bentley
Should I write to the coder to make a new build?

2020-10-14T11:34:20 bentley -> idgo
At the start?

2020-10-14T11:35:01 idgo -> bentley
After the system info command

2020-10-14T12:04:08 idgo -> bentley
yes

2020-10-14T12:04:24 bentley -> idgo
Write to the coder, then.

2020-10-14T12:05:04 idgo -> bentley
I already wrote it, and I sent you the log

2020-10-14T12:05:51 bentley -> idgo
Okay

2020-10-14T19:19:24 idgo -> bentley
Bro, I guess that's it for today?

2020-10-14T19:21:34 bentley -> idgo
What did the coder say?

2020-10-14T19:22:28 idgo -> bentley
[14.10.2020 15:08:27] <Coder> tell me, are you checking with cloud protection turned off and sending samples turned off?
[14.10.2020 15:10:13] <idgo> only sending samples disabled.
[14.10.2020 15:14:56] <coder> did Bentley instruct you on how to check/prepare BC builds?
[14.10.2020 15:17:13] <idgo> yes
[14.10.2020 15:17:22] <coder> [30.09.2020 12:44:18] <kaktus> we have instructions to test sources with cloud protection disabled [30.09.2020 12:44:53] <kaktus> [17.09.20202020 10:39:41] <buza> cloud check should be enabled only before the attack [17.09.2020 10:46:20] <buza> I repeat, it should be enabled only before the attack [17.09.2020 10:46:25] <buza> otherwise samples are merged in realtime [17.09.2020 10:46:30] <buza> and all your cleans are useless [17.09.2020 10:46:41] <buza> i.e. you should also disable it at the tester for the test [30.09.2020 12:45:16] <kaktus> if there is a detector only in a cloud - I can't repeat it in mine [30.09.2020 12:45:43] <kaktus> I check only without cloud [30.09.2020 12:46:26] <kaktus> I will check my build once more, if it has a detection - I will clean it
[14.10.2020 15:17:55] <coder> be nice, check source with cloud disabled.
[14.10.2020 15:18:15] <Coder> that is, if the detection is only because of the cloud - I can't confirm it.
[14.10.2020 15:18:32] <Coder> I'll double-check the assembly in any case
[14.10.2020 15:19:43] <idgo>
" [15:17:55] <Coder > be kind, check the source with the cloud disabled.
Took it, no one told me about the cloud, only about sending samples. I'll know now, thanks.

2020-10-14T19:22:56 bentley -> idgo
checked without the cloud?

2020-10-14T19:23:36 idgo -> bentley
First time with the cloud, since I didn't know.

2020-10-14T19:23:50 idgo -> bentley
only the sending of samples was disabled

2020-10-14T19:23:51 bentley -> idgo
What about the second one?

2020-10-14T19:24:18 idgo -> bentley
the second one was already disconnected

2020-10-14T19:24:33 idgo -> bentley
the coder wrote I turned it off right away

2020-10-14T19:25:13 bentley -> idgo
Detect again?

2020-10-14T19:25:29 idgo -> bentley
yes

2020-10-14T19:25:49 bentley -> idgo
Did you write to the coder about it? That he turned off the cloud and detected it again?

2020-10-14T19:27:14 idgo -> bentley
I sent him the second log, he said he would recheck the build

2020-10-14T19:27:39 bentley -> idgo
And of yes?

2020-10-14T19:28:00 idgo -> bentley
Offline right now.

2020-10-14T19:28:05 idgo -> bentley
didn't write anything off

2020-10-14T19:28:24 bentley -> idgo
already for tomorrow

2020-10-14T19:29:24 idgo -> bentley
Okay, see you tomorrow then.

2020-10-14T19:29:39 bentley -> idgo
Yep

2020-10-15T09:02:28 idgo -> bentley
Hi, the coder dropped off a new build

2020-10-15T09:02:39 idgo -> bentley
the procedure is all the same ?

2020-10-15T09:03:03 bentley -> idgo
Yes

2020-10-15T09:19:51 idgo -> bentley
the source code is not tapped in BC

2020-10-15T09:20:18 bentley -> idgo
Write to the coder.

2020-10-15T09:20:23 bentley -> idgo
Try to figure it out

2020-10-15T09:20:29 bentley -> idgo
Did you pour it into the BC admin?

2020-10-15T09:20:35 bentley -> idgo
Loider new and new bk?

2020-10-15T09:20:44 bentley -> idgo
Did you put the correct versions?

bro knocked the bots off after an hour

2020-10-15T10:18:01 bentley -> idgo
Interesting. Did you write back to the coder? What was knocked back after an hour

2020-10-15T10:18:13 idgo -> bentley
just wrote back

2020-10-15T10:18:20 bentley -> idgo

2020-10-15T10:18:31 bentley -> idgo
Make a test with a fix.

2020-10-15T10:18:46 bentley -> idgo
If he did not change any functionality then there is no need to do a full test

2020-10-15T10:18:55 bentley -> idgo

<kaktus> says it has constantly changing ip they come from
[20:11:36] <kaktus> so you can't bind all addresses to work with Staged versions of files
[20:11:48] <kaktus> is there any way to fix it?
[20:12:24] <bentley> Static ipv ipn

2020-10-19T13:12:58 bentley -> idgo
Can you do that for yourself?

2020-10-19T13:16:18 idgo -> bentley
Static is unlikely, you need to make a request to your ISP. Or try to build a base of ip with ipn.

2020-10-19T13:22:45 bentley -> idgo
What kind of VPN do you have?

2020-10-19T13:23:08 idgo -> bentley

I will try to collect ip
