Hi

2020-06-22T13:32:29 strix -> bentley
Rolled up a little script in python. Seems to work for cPanel and another admin area, as an experiment.

2020-06-22T13:33:02 bentley -> strix
WOW!

2020-06-22T13:35:03 strix -> bentley
I autodetect there by the window header and some other controls.

2020-06-22T13:37:11 strix -> bentley
As an experiment, I installed Selenium on Venda-Seven -- it seems to work.

2020-06-22T13:38:13 strix -> bentley
By the way, the second script with downloading files in chrome can also be done on selenium.

2020-06-22T13:38:27 bentley -> strix
Alright!

2020-06-22T13:44:08 strix -> bentley
For linux, there is a program send-notify, which sends notifications to the user in the tray and popup messages. It would be nice to find a Windows analog and use it in the second script

2020-06-22T14:15:56 strix -> bentley
Do you need support for any additional admins, other than cPanel, and don't care about them?

2020-06-22T14:16:20 bentley -> strix
Ideally we should, but the spanel is the most important thing

2020-06-22T14:17:07 strix -> bentley
if you have to, can you give me some for the primer?

2020-06-22T14:17:17 bentley -> strix
Yeah, I'll look for it.

2020-06-22T14:17:34 strix -> bentley
chtoby bylo on chem testit/

2020-06-22T14:17:42 bentley -> strix
Yep

2020-06-22T15:25:03 strix -> bentley
What's up? Any examples of other admins?

2020-06-22T15:25:22 strix -> bentley
/me came from the store -- went to get milk

2020-06-22T15:25:46 bentley -> strix
So... I'll throw in 20 more minutes.

2020-06-22T17:06:02 strix -> bentley
FUCK, I dropped my laptop on the floor with my foot on the cord :(

2020-06-22T17:06:34 strix -> bentley
There was, among other things, a script I wrote 2 days ago.

2020-06-22T17:07:05 strix -> bentley
I'll have to restore everything, buy a new drive, and re-write the script. :(

2020-06-22T17:07:25 bentley -> strix
that's so bad!!!

2020-06-22T17:07:50 bentley -> strix
:-O

2020-06-22T17:08:47 strix -> bentley
It's 8 p.m., computer stores are closed, so I'll have to buy a new drive tomorrow.

2020-06-22T17:10:51 strix -> bentley
Notebook turns on, but won't boot from hard drive - the head is jerking.

2020-06-22T17:22:24 bentley -> strix
Hana to the hard

2020-06-22T17:23:41 strix -> bentley
Yeah, you have to buy a new one.

2020-06-22T17:24:46 bentley -> strix
Get the csd. It'll be faster and won't be such a problem either

2020-06-22T17:26:01 strix -> bentley
It's probably a lot more expensive.

2020-06-22T17:26:11 bentley -> strix
no.

2020-06-22T17:26:25 strix -> bentley
For 2 ter?

2020-06-22T17:26:35 bentley -> strix
Ahhh

2020-06-22T17:26:38 bentley -> strix
 Right.

2020-06-22T17:27:26 strix -> bentley
I had two drives there, the main one was 2 ter, and the other was 750 gigs.

2020-06-22T17:27:46 bentley -> strix
28000 2 tb ssd !

2020-06-22T17:27:51 bentley -> strix
Tough!

2020-06-22T17:28:08 strix -> bentley
it's more expensive than I bought the whole laptop

2020-06-22T17:28:27 bentley -> strix
Yep.

2020-06-22T17:52:52 strix -> bentley
Huh, even GRUB is still alive on the second hard drive (the 750 gig one) :)

2020-06-22T17:53:06 bentley -> strix
Cool!

2020-06-22T17:53:20 strix -> bentley
He wasn't addressed much at all, and it's possible he fell asleep and stayed alive :)

2020-06-22T17:53:32 bentley -> strix
well

2020-06-22T17:58:14 strix -> bentley
I'll make the script all over again. There, by the way, the script was only 3 and a half kilobytes long.

2020-06-22T17:58:29 bentley -> strix
Cool!

2020-06-25T15:50:11 strix -> bentley
hi

2020-06-25T15:50:32 strix -> bentley
/me wrote the script again

2020-06-25T15:51:19 bentley -> strix
great!

2020-06-25T15:51:25 strix -> bentley
Also, rebuilt my computer. Installed a new drive, by the way, with SSD caching

2020-06-25T15:51:39 bentley -> strix
Nice topic )

2020-06-25T15:51:44 strix -> bentley
also on 2tb

2020-06-25T15:52:31 strix -> bentley
Do you want to test the script?

2020-06-25T15:52:41 bentley -> strix
Of course I do!

How do you run it?

2020-06-25T16:00:27 strix -> bentley
you just run it without parameters. Next to it should be the file servers.txt, with the format of the lines "url user pass", and the comments, nachinayushchiesya s ";", razresheny

2020-06-25T16:05:33 strix -> bentley
Well and selenium has to be put in first.

How do you post it?

2020-06-25T16:06:13 strix -> bentley

2020-06-25T16:07:25 bentley -> strix
How do you put it in?

2020-06-25T16:07:46 strix -> bentley
you put git-bash and python first, then pip install selenium

2020-06-25T16:07:59 bentley -> strix
Will it work on Windows?

2020-06-25T16:08:17 strix -> bentley
on the windup and put it on

2020-06-25T16:11:47 bentley -> strix
https://git-scm.com/downloads

2020-06-25T16:11:47 bentley -> strix
https://git-scm.com/downloads

2020-06-25T16:12:06 bentley -> strix
From here put git-bash ?

2020-06-25T16:14:11 strix -> bentley
I think so.

2020-06-25T16:14:11 strix -> bentley
I think so.

2020-06-25T16:14:38 strix -> bentley
and then install Python from the off site

2020-06-25T16:20:52 bentley -> strix
Put a python on it.

2020-06-25T16:20:52 bentley -> strix
Put a python on it.

2020-06-25T16:20:58 bentley -> strix
How to put pip install selenium ?

2020-06-25T16:24:28 strix -> bentley
Does python run from a git-bash window?

2020-06-25T16:24:28 strix -> bentley
Does python run from a git-bash window?

2020-06-25T16:25:14 bentley -> strix
how do you get it to run?

2020-06-25T16:25:34 strix -> bentley
type python

2020-06-25T16:25:57 bentley -> strix
bash: python: command not found

2020-06-25T16:26:29 strix -> bentley
So you must put the path to the python binary in the PATH

2020-06-25T16:27:44 bentley -> strix
What file should I put it in?

2020-06-25T16:29:11 strix -> bentley
Not in the file, but where you write the paths in the Windows -- System Properties->Paths

2020-06-25T16:29:11 strix -> bentley
Not in the file, but where you write the paths in the Windows -- System Properties->Paths

2020-06-25T16:30:32 bentley -> strix
environment variables?

2020-06-25T16:31:50 strix -> bentley
Yep, and then look for the PATH, add c:\Program Files\Python (or wherever you have python.exe installed) to the end of the path, after the semicolon

2020-06-25T16:31:50 strix -> bentley
Yep, and then look for the PATH, add c:\Program Files\Python (or wherever you have python.exe installed) to the end of the path, after the semicolon

2020-06-25T16:32:36 bentley -> strix
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32

2020-06-25T16:32:42 strix -> bentley
Then restart the git-bash window and python should start

2020-06-25T16:32:47 bentley -> strix
I had it put there.

2020-06-25T16:32:57 bentley -> strix
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32; do I do that?

2020-06-25T16:33:06 bentley -> strix
You don't need to write the eche itself?

2020-06-25T16:33:27 strix -> bentley
No, it's some data from python. And pynon itself is somewhere in Program Files -- look there

2020-06-25T16:33:43 strix -> bentley
you don't need the exe itself, you need the dir where it is located

2020-06-25T16:35:08 bentley -> strix
I have an exe there and there is nothing in the program files

2020-06-25T16:35:08 bentley -> strix
I have an exe there and there is nothing in the program files

2020-06-25T16:35:18 strix -> bentley
oddly enough

2020-06-25T16:35:28 strix -> bentley
well, write this dir

2020-06-25T16:35:36 bentley -> strix
I prescribed

2020-06-25T16:35:40 bentley -> strix
It won't start

2020-06-25T16:35:44 bentley -> strix
I have a server wind.

2020-06-25T16:35:52 strix -> bentley
did you restart the window?

2020-06-25T16:36:43 bentley -> strix
Of course

2020-06-25T16:37:30 strix -> bentley
in the git-bash window, type echo $PATH -- did it say the dir you added?

2020-06-25T16:38:13 strix -> bentley
and the drive letter before \users\administrator\... added?

2020-06-25T16:38:16 bentley -> strix
no

2020-06-25T16:38:21 bentley -> strix
Reboot the windup?

2020-06-25T16:38:41 strix -> bentley
You don't need to reboot. You just spelled it wrong somewhere.

2020-06-25T16:38:56 strix -> bentley
Show the PATH/ string in its entirety.

2020-06-25T16:39:33 bentley -> strix
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32;

2020-06-25T16:40:13 strix -> bentley
No, fully PATH

2020-06-25T16:40:54 strix -> bentley
That's not the only thing you have there, is it?

2020-06-25T16:42:11 bentley -> strix
So...

2020-06-25T16:42:41 bentley -> strix
Hfpj,hfkcz

2020-06-25T16:42:44 bentley -> strix
Got it figured out.

2020-06-25T16:42:50 bentley -> strix
Python is up and running.

2020-06-25T16:42:59 strix -> bentley
What was it?

2020-06-25T16:43:09 strix -> bentley
okay

2020-06-25T16:43:57 bentley -> strix
I wrote to the wrong place.)

2020-06-25T16:44:18 bentley -> strix
Tuck. what do I do next?

2020-06-25T16:44:48 strix -> bentley
now exit python, and in the git-bash window type "pip install selenium"

2020-06-25T16:45:46 bentley -> strix
bash: pip install selenium: command not found

2020-06-25T16:45:46 bentley -> strix

The pip command should go with python.

2020-06-25T16:46:38 strix -> bentley
Isn't it next to python.exe?

2020-06-25T16:49:33 bentley -> strix
Tux...

2020-06-25T16:49:54 bentley -> strix
What should be lying next to it?

2020-06-25T16:50:07 strix -> bentley
pip.exe

2020-06-25T16:50:19 bentley -> strix
no

2020-06-25T16:50:23 bentley -> strix
where to get it?

2020-06-25T16:50:32 strix -> bentley
look in neighboring dirs

2020-06-25T16:50:50 strix -> bentley
bin something

2020-06-25T16:52:42 bentley -> strix
Found it, put it down.

2020-06-25T16:52:54 strix -> bentley
no need to move

2020-06-25T16:52:57 bentley -> strix
Do I spell it with quotation marks?

2020-06-25T16:53:18 strix -> bentley
it is better to add the path to the second directive to the PATH

2020-06-25T16:53:33 strix -> bentley
Are there spaces in there?

2020-06-25T16:53:51 strix -> bentley
without quotation marks, supposedly

2020-06-25T16:54:15 bentley -> strix
No gaps

2020-06-25T16:54:29 strix -> bentley
So the quotes are unnecessary.

2020-06-25T16:54:44 bentley -> strix

2020-06-25T16:55:19 strix -> bentley
So you're typing in python, and you should be typing in bash.

2020-06-25T16:55:27 strix -> bentley
come out of the python

2020-06-25T16:55:46 strix -> bentley
exit()

2020-06-25T16:56:30 bentley -> strix
GO!

2020-06-25T16:56:42 bentley -> strix
Chet downloaded and installed

2020-06-25T16:57:39 strix -> bentley
Well, now all that's left is to download Chrome, plus selenium chromedriver, of the same version, and put it on the PATH.

2020-06-25T16:58:00 strix -> bentley
you can do version 83

2020-06-25T16:58:16 strix -> bentley
Google "selenium chromedrivvvvvvvvver"

2020-06-25T16:58:32 strix -> bentley
selenium chromedriver

2020-06-25T16:58:37 bentley -> strix
Ok

2020-06-25T17:12:27 strix -> bentley
What's up?

2020-06-25T17:17:07 bentley -> strix
Installed the chrome driver

2020-06-25T17:17:15 bentley -> strix
I ran your script.

2020-06-25T17:17:26 bentley -> strix
The output is an empty servers_filtered.txt file

2020-06-25T17:18:26 strix -> bentley
Did you add anything to the servers.txt?

2020-06-25T17:18:50 bentley -> strix
Of course it is 24kb with a list of servers

2020-06-25T17:19:14 strix -> bentley
show me an example of a line

2020-06-25T17:19:37 bentley -> strix
so. I ran it just by clicking on the script itself

2020-06-25T17:19:44 bentley -> strix
How do you run it?

2020-06-25T17:20:10 strix -> bentley
What do you mean by clicking? You have to run ./col.py from the command line

2020-06-25T17:21:51 bentley -> strix

2020-06-25T17:21:55 bentley -> strix

2020-06-25T17:22:02 bentley -> strix

2020-06-25T17:25:43 strix -> bentley
change python3 to python

2020-06-25T17:26:08 bentley -> strix
where to change?

2020-06-25T17:26:21 strix -> bentley
in the script, of course

early on in

2020-06-25T17:34:11 strix -> bentley
maybe an access rights issue?

2020-06-25T17:36:40 strix -> bentley
you can have any

2020-06-25T17:36:50 bentley -> strix
Ok

2020-06-25T17:37:45 strix -> bentley
Looks like the same thing happened with the verlhelle script. Looks like you need to find the current dir and add it to have the full path. I don't know what the fuck the windup doesn't want to open in the current directory.

2020-06-25T17:38:22 bentley -> strix
The server wind is giving me a headache.

2020-06-25T17:40:48 strix -> bentley

That's not the right format. It should be like this:

2020-06-25T18:02:51 strix -> bentley
Lines like "url user pass"

2020-06-25T18:03:02 strix -> bentley
you can separate with spaces or tabs

2020-06-25T18:03:23 strix -> bentley
comments like "; tralala" are allowed

2020-06-25T18:04:20 bentley -> strix
I get this one with spaces.

2020-06-25T18:04:34 bentley -> strix
Is there any way to get it into the form the scripts need?

2020-06-25T18:04:47 strix -> bentley
I don't even know how to parse one of these

2020-06-25T18:05:28 bentley -> strix
Is there any way to make a script that would make it look right?

2020-06-25T18:06:25 strix -> bentley
Well, you could try writing a converter in awk.

2020-06-25T18:07:07 bentley -> strix
That's a lot of hemorrhoids. All over the place )

2020-06-25T19:12:21 strix -> bentley

Hello

2020-06-26T13:27:21 strix -> bentley
Yesterday, I mapped out the source data converter, plus I tweaked the script a bit.

2020-06-26T13:27:38 bentley -> strix
great

2020-06-26T13:28:10 strix -> bentley
Shall we try it?

2020-06-26T13:28:33 bentley -> strix
Sure, but in about an hour or so

2020-06-26T13:28:59 strix -> bentley
Yeah, I'm gonna run to the store, too.

2020-06-26T15:14:29 bentley -> strix
I'm ready if you are.

2020-06-26T15:47:44 strix -> bentley
change python3 to python in the script yet

2020-06-26T15:48:21 bentley -> strix
Tuck.

2020-06-26T15:48:25 bentley -> strix
 How is everything working?

2020-06-26T15:50:50 strix -> bentley
take the file with the source data, and convert: awk -f conv.awk server0.txt >servers.txt

2020-06-26T15:51:10 strix -> bentley
awk.exe must be bundled with git-bash

2020-06-26T15:52:08 strix -> bentley
where server0.txt is the file with the initial data

2020-06-26T15:53:28 bentley -> strix
Run it appeared servers.txt empty

2020-06-26T15:53:57 strix -> bentley
did you put server0.txt?

2020-06-26T15:54:15 bentley -> strix
yes

2020-06-26T15:54:41 bentley -> strix
$ dir
col.py conv.awk server0.txt servers.txt

2020-06-26T15:54:41 strix -> bentley
did you change the dir to the one where all the files are located?

2020-06-26T16:01:14 strix -> bentley
I'll probably have to put the windup in my test tube and check it out.

2020-06-26T16:01:33 bentley -> strix
Yeah (

2020-06-26T16:01:35 strix -> bentley
I used to have it, but it got ruined along with the old screw

2020-06-26T16:01:43 bentley -> strix
Got it

2020-06-26T16:02:07 strix -> bentley
I have youn7 32-bit, but something doesn't seem to want to install it on 32-bit :(

2020-06-26T16:02:22 bentley -> strix
clearly

2020-06-26T16:15:45 strix -> bentley
/me put git-bash under youn7-32

2020-06-26T16:16:18 strix -> bentley
Indeed, conv.awk does not output anything

2020-06-26T16:16:22 strix -> bentley
wonders

2020-06-26T16:17:37 strix -> bentley
hmm, that's weird. Try to replace the line RS="\r\n" at the beginning of the script. The comment symbol is a lattice #

2020-06-26T16:17:46 strix -> bentley
# RS="\r\n"

2020-06-26T16:18:53 strix -> bentley
should work

2020-06-26T16:19:19 bentley -> strix

2020-06-26T16:20:17 bentley -> strix
Just comment it out?

2020-06-26T16:21:09 strix -> bentley
Yes, just put a comment character before the line RS="\r\n"

2020-06-26T16:21:19 bentley -> strix
Ok

2020-06-26T16:21:32 bentley -> strix
Same thing

2020-06-26T16:21:44 strix -> bentley
And then try awk -f conv.awk server0.txt >servers.txt again

2020-06-26T16:22:26 strix -> bentley
What's the same thing? -- It works for me.

2020-06-26T16:22:27 bentley -> strix
Also an empty dock on the way out.

2020-06-26T16:22:56 strix -> bentley
Did you put yesterday's servers.txt? Or some other file?

2020-06-26T16:23:25 bentley -> strix
Of course yesterday renamed it server0.txt

2020-06-26T16:23:48 strix -> bentley
That's weird.

2020-06-26T16:23:56 bentley -> strix

2020-06-26T16:23:59 strix -> bentley
I have everything working under the windup

2020-06-26T16:24:15 bentley -> strix
Is it because of the server?

2020-06-26T16:24:34 strix -> bentley
What difference does it make, server or no server?

2020-06-26T16:24:46 bentley -> strix
I don't know if there's anything wrong with it.

2020-06-26T16:24:48 strix -> bentley
Do you have you take out 2012?

2020-06-26T16:24:55 bentley -> strix

2020-06-26T16:25:05 strix -> bentley
I'm going to try it on another machine with wine 2012

I don't have 2016, unfortunately

2020-06-26T16:26:15 strix -> bentley
Are you sure you type the command like this: awk -f conv.awk server0.txt >servers.txt

2020-06-26T16:26:17 strix -> bentley
,

2020-06-26T16:26:18 strix -> bentley

2020-06-26T16:34:06 bentley -> strix
Come on over to my server.

2020-06-26T16:34:20 strix -> bentley
And show me how you commented out the line in conv.awk?

2020-06-26T16:34:37 strix -> bentley
Or give me access

2020-06-26T16:34:43 bentley -> strix
BEGIN {
    #RS="\r\n"
}

2020-06-26T16:34:46 bentley -> strix
Like this

2020-06-26T16:35:07 strix -> bentley
Holy shit

2020-06-26T16:35:34 strix -> bentley
Would RS="\n" make any difference?

2020-06-26T16:36:26 bentley -> strix
no way

2020-06-26T16:37:09 strix -> bentley
Then give me access and I'll try your machine

2020-06-26T16:37:26 bentley -> strix
now

2020-06-26T16:38:02 strix -> bentley
Okay, 5 seconds, I'm going to get some water -- I have to go out for about 10 minutes.

2020-06-26T16:38:14 bentley -> strix
Yeah while I put the ticker

2020-06-26T16:49:08 strix -> bentley
Or maybe you have server0.txt on the wrong system? Can you show me?

2020-06-26T16:49:41 bentley -> strix
I sent it to you yesterday.

2020-06-26T16:49:44 bentley -> strix

Which one?

2020-06-26T17:03:50 strix -> bentley
I have 13 and can't connect

2020-06-26T17:04:10 bentley -> strix
13

2020-06-26T17:04:13 bentley -> strix
 I'll look for it.

2020-06-26T17:04:15 strix -> bentley
You can't put a newer one on winxp

2020-06-26T17:04:57 strix -> bentley
There are different versions on the off site. By the way, you don't have to install it - you can just run it in portable mode.

2020-06-26T17:09:11 strix -> bentley

Yes they are greedy in timka

2020-06-26T17:11:39 bentley -> strix
come on anidesc.

2020-06-26T17:13:05 strix -> bentley
Where did you get the 15? I only see 14 on www.teamviewer.com

2020-06-26T17:13:20 bentley -> strix
It defaults to 15.

2020-06-26T17:14:17 strix -> bentley

2020-06-26T17:27:48 strix -> bentley
it was just like the original

2020-06-26T17:28:13 bentley -> strix
I put the grille too close.

2020-06-26T17:28:28 bentley -> strix
Now what about the other script?

2020-06-26T17:28:36 strix -> bentley
What do you mean, too close?

2020-06-26T17:29:33 strix -> bentley
Well, it's all converted.

2020-06-26T17:29:44 bentley -> strix
yes I see

2020-06-26T17:29:46 strix -> bentley
Now you can run col.py

2020-06-26T17:29:50 bentley -> strix
give me the second script

2020-06-26T17:30:19 strix -> bentley
Yeah, in the second script first replace python3 with python at the beginning

2020-06-26T17:30:38 strix -> bentley
And you can run it in the same window as ./col.py

2020-06-26T17:30:48 bentley -> strix
do it already

2020-06-26T17:31:52 strix -> bentley
hmm

2020-06-26T17:32:26 strix -> bentley
Did you put chromedriver.exe on the PATH?

2020-06-26T17:32:40 strix -> bentley

2020-06-26T17:32:43 bentley -> strix
I have it in my downloads.

2020-06-26T17:34:25 strix -> bentley
now restart the git-bash window

2020-06-26T17:36:17 bentley -> strix
yes

2020-06-26T17:36:24 bentley -> strix
chromdrive also downloaded

2020-06-26T17:37:14 strix -> bentley

2020-06-26T18:03:01 strix -> bentley

2020-06-26T18:03:05 strix -> bentley

2020-06-26T18:04:10 bentley -> strix
Yeah and you have a good rest ))

2020-06-26T18:04:40 strix -> bentley
There was a second problem, with dovnload files. -- Can't you give me examples of such files, so I could poke around?

2020-06-26T18:05:15 bentley -> strix
Tux.

2020-06-26T18:05:33 bentley -> strix
You have to upload them to one of these addresses and try to download them in chrome.

2020-06-26T18:06:13 bentley -> strix
I'll pour it on.

2020-06-26T18:06:16 strix -> bentley
Well can you download one for now, and give the URL?

2020-06-26T18:06:42 strix -> bentley
At least to see what kind of varnings chrome gives out.

2020-06-26T18:06:52 bentley -> strix
Yep

2020-06-26T18:07:34 strix -> bentley
Strange, in the wine the page opens, but the login / password are not entered, and the browser closes, for some reason.

2020-06-26T18:07:46 strix -> bentley
-- I'm talking about the first problem.

2020-06-26T18:09:09 bentley -> strix
https://copyrightlive-ksa.com/Preview_Report.exe

2020-06-26T18:09:17 bentley -> strix
In chrome alt.

2020-06-26T18:09:37 bentley -> strix
Chrome has blocked the file as dangerous .

2020-06-26T18:11:09 strix -> bentley
I get 404

2020-06-26T18:11:23 bentley -> strix
Hmmm.

2020-06-26T18:11:27 bentley -> strix
I'm downloading

2020-06-26T18:12:50 strix -> bentley
Ah, there's an underscore, I thought it was a space.

2020-06-26T18:12:55 strix -> bentley
Yes, there is an alert.

2020-06-26T18:13:16 bentley -> strix
greenmountains.ae/YAS42.exe

2020-06-26T18:13:24 bentley -> strix
That's a different alert right there.

2020-06-26T18:13:32 bentley -> strix
The file is rarely downloaded

2020-06-26T18:15:45 strix -> bentley
ERR_SSL+VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISSMATCH came up

2020-06-26T18:15:57 bentley -> strix
no https

2020-06-26T18:16:01 bentley -> strix
simple http

2020-06-26T18:16:21 strix -> bentley
Ah, it's not .com, it's .ae.

2020-06-26T18:18:55 bentley -> strix
https://ebeautytrade.com/calc.exe

2020-06-26T18:19:06 bentley -> strix
And this one rocks without alerts.

2020-06-26T18:20:02 strix -> bentley
Yeah, I see. Would it be ok if I make a file with this URL on each line and try to download them one by one?

2020-06-26T18:21:12 strix -> bentley
"YASL42.exe file is rarely downloaded. Maybe it's malicious" - I guess that should be ignored?

2020-06-26T18:21:26 bentley -> strix
Another nuance. There will be different files and links all the time and you need to check the link, which should be somehow set in the prog. And the program must somehow report that the file stopped being downloaded. Let's go chrome alerts

2020-06-26T18:21:34 strix -> bentley
Here's how to distinguish between different alerts, I don't know yet.

2020-06-26T18:22:09 bentley -> strix
When you get alerts from an initially clean link, you need to let the user know it appeared. With a sound or a popup

2020-06-26T18:22:42 strix -> bentley
Well the input file for the script should be changed if new links appear.

2020-06-26T18:24:38 strix -> bentley
Well, I have send_notify in linux. Different programs can send alerts through it, and they are shown in a popup message or in an icon in the tray. I don't know how to do it in Windows. Maybe someone knows a similar Windows program?

2020-06-26T18:25:51 bentley -> strix
What kind of linux do you have? Maybe I should download a virtual machine with it and not fuck my brains out with the wine for the business?

2020-06-26T18:26:20 strix -> bentley
Debian 10 I have.

2020-06-26T18:26:28 bentley -> strix
Doesn't she give sounds like notifications?

2020-06-26T18:26:36 bentley -> strix
Like a siren if a file is stolen)

2020-06-26T18:26:43 strix -> bentley
You can try it, of course.

2020-06-26T18:27:01 bentley -> strix
Let's do it this weekend.

2020-06-26T18:27:25 strix -> bentley
No sounds -- a pop-up message, and the tray icon has a menu that displays a list of unviewed messages.

2020-06-26T18:27:59 bentley -> strix
I just have it minimized if there is a sound alert I will know what to open and check

2020-06-26T18:28:08 bentley -> strix
That would be awesome!

2020-06-26T18:28:46 strix -> bentley
Well, you can run some program that plays an audio file

2020-06-26T18:28:54 strix -> bentley
at alerter

2020-06-26T18:37:34 strix -> bentley
Oh man, I found the reason why it doesn't work under wendas - the header of the cPanel window is in russian, while I expected it to be in english.

2020-06-26T18:37:43 strix -> bentley
I'll fix that, I guess.

2020-06-26T18:40:13 strix -> bentley
hmmm, why does the Venda ignore LANG=en_US?

2020-06-26T18:40:29 bentley -> strix
What a bastard.

2020-06-26T18:40:34 strix -> bentley
How do I tell it to use the English locale?

2020-06-26T18:40:48 bentley -> strix
hz

2020-06-26T18:46:07 strix -> bentley
Man, it's not like that.

2020-06-26T18:50:25 strix -> bentley
There, I found a way for Chromium

2020-06-26T18:50:40 strix -> bentley
for Firefox will not work, of course

2020-06-26T18:50:56 bentley -> strix
We need Chrome.

2020-06-26T18:51:49 strix -> bentley
I wanted universally

2020-06-26T18:55:16 strix -> bentley
here is the edited script: https://send.firefox.com/download/b562b1cc96fbfbe0/#tOHn-QnBXDq8HfPXpdNbpQ (password "suxxXX")

2020-06-26T18:55:25 strix -> bentley
Try

2020-06-26T18:55:33 bentley -> strix
Yep

2020-06-26T18:57:41 bentley -> strix
I sent the python. Run

2020-06-26T19:00:26 bentley -> strix
Does it write to the file at the end ?

2020-06-26T19:00:33 bentley -> strix
There was one Saxx.

2020-06-26T19:03:41 strix -> bentley
it appears in the file after you interrupt the script, or the script completes on its own

2020-06-26T19:04:04 bentley -> strix
Ok wait )

2020-06-26T19:04:23 strix -> bentley
There are 35 successful

2020-06-26T19:04:35 bentley -> strix
Yep

2020-06-26T19:04:55 strix -> bentley
Of the 160 total.

2020-06-26T19:46:10 bentley -> strix
It all worked out!!! Task completed! THANK YOU!!!!

2020-06-26T19:46:37 strix -> bentley
gut

2020-06-26T19:47:28 bentley -> strix
I've been doing this job for hours! It's all automatic now!

2020-06-26T19:47:38 strix -> bentley
with your hands?

2020-06-26T19:47:48 bentley -> strix
Yep

2020-06-26T19:49:00 strix -> bentley
There may be a problem: if some server is temporarily down, it will show fail. So you can run the script several times, after some break, and compare the resulting output file

2020-06-26T19:49:54 bentley -> strix
Ok

2020-06-26T19:50:36 strix -> bentley
By the way, if you want to see the browser window, commit the opts.add_argument("headless") line in the browser options (there at the beginning of the script)

2020-06-26T19:51:15 bentley -> strix
I think the command line is more fucked up.)

2020-06-26T19:53:09 strix -> bentley
Yes, the browser window is an eyesore. But sometimes, if something goes wrong, you can look in the browser. For example, the last time I had the login/password fields in winnda, they wouldn't fill in. They just didn't come up. The window header was wrong, and that was it.

2020-06-26T19:55:47 bentley -> strix
Thanks again for the work!

2020-06-26T19:55:50 bentley -> strix

Can you drop me the latest script that will check logins and passwords?

2020-07-07T09:26:46 bentley -> strix
Because I have a lot of stuff and I don't understand which version is the latest.

2020-07-07T12:13:29 strix -> bentley

2020-07-14T13:15:02 bentley -> strix
I have a question about the task: file checker in chrome.

2020-07-14T13:15:09 bentley -> strix
Anything clear on the timeline with her?

2020-07-14T13:24:45 strix -> bentley
I asked the same thing a few days ago

2020-07-14T13:25:01 bentley -> strix
Yeah Target is chomping at the bit.

2020-07-14T13:27:29 strix -> bentley
I started writing the second script last week -- at the moment it's pumping successfully and no alerts are coming out at all. No matter how I tried, they don't turn on. I'll try to google and experiment some more, but at the moment I have some more administrative tasks to deal with, so I haven't gotten around to the script yet.

2020-07-14T13:28:28 bentley -> strix
I see. Can you make it this week?

2020-07-14T13:28:40 strix -> bentley
Googling is full of answers to the question how to turn off the alerts, but the opposite, how to turn them on - there is nothing

2020-07-14T13:28:53 strix -> bentley
I'll try again this week.

2020-07-14T13:29:37 bentley -> strix
Waiting. ))

2020-07-14T13:31:27 strix -> bentley
By the way, the link to the https://greenmountains.ae/YAS42.exe file you gave for the test is already dead. The others seem to be alive.

2020-07-14T13:33:00 bentley -> strix
Yeah the links are dying out there. You tell me when you're done, I'll put in new ones.

2020-07-14T13:33:22 strix -> bentley
Okay, I'll ask you later.

2020-07-14T13:33:27 bentley -> strix
Ok

2020-07-14T13:34:48 strix -> bentley
What's that thing with the alerts in chrome called? Smart browsing? Or Safe something?

2020-07-14T13:35:37 bentley -> strix
That's when you download the file and it says it's suspicious or dangerous.

2020-07-14T13:35:51 strix -> bentley

2020-07-14T16:59:55 bentley -> strix
Or how should it be?

2020-07-14T17:00:04 strix -> bentley
Well, to get chrome to swear at them.

2020-07-14T17:01:15 strix -> bentley
For example, these files YAS42.exe Prew_Report.exe -- which used to be

2020-07-14T17:01:22 bentley -> strix
https://nutritionprofbob.com/DocumentPreview.exe

2020-07-14T17:01:41 bentley -> strix
This file is rarely downloaded. It may be malicious.

2020-07-14T17:02:12 strix -> bentley
The link to calc.exe (which is not being scolded) is still alive

2020-07-14T17:04:35 bentley -> strix

Oh, thanks a lot.

2020-07-14T21:26:59 strix -> bentley
heere?

2020-07-14T21:27:26 strix -> bentley
this link https://violinstop.com/DocumentPreview.exe chrome does not give an alert

2020-07-14T21:28:06 strix -> bentley
to this one it opens the title page https://nutritionprofbob.com

2020-07-14T21:28:35 strix -> bentley
both by hand and in selenium

2020-07-14T21:29:09 strix -> bentley
i.e., the test file does not work

2020-07-14T21:57:30 strix -> bentley
Anyway, give me a working test file, I have nothing to test on.

Do you have "standard protection" or "enhaanced protection" in Safe browsing?

2020-07-15T13:20:49 bentley -> strix
Standard

2020-07-15T13:21:14 strix -> bentley
I had the same URLs that you gave me before

It's not fighting now.

2020-07-15T13:21:40 bentley -> strix
It's not clear at all.

2020-07-15T13:26:29 strix -> bentley
does not even respond to http://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt (this is a test "virus")

2020-07-15T14:02:47 strix -> bentley
google has a service https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search to check it, that's what safe browsing uses

2020-07-15T14:03:29 bentley -> strix
Hmm. I'll take a look.

2020-07-15T14:03:34 strix -> bentley
Well, this service says that the url https://violinstop.com/DocumentPreview.exe did not find anything suspicious

2020-07-15T14:04:01 strix -> bentley
can you give me the other test files?

2020-07-15T14:04:01 strix -> bentley
can you give me the other test files?

2020-07-15T15:00:49 strix -> bentley
What's up? Will you give me the working test files? I have nothing to test on, and time is running out.

2020-07-15T15:01:05 bentley -> strix
Yeah, I'll load it up.

main #298

2020-07-15T19:02:12 bentley -> strix
Description

1. We need to find and figure out how Chrome and IE check links on SmartScreen.
That is, you need a service on the Internet like, "is this link OK or not OK?"
That's what browsers do.

2. In Problem 296 we will get the links from a file uploaded to FTP.
We need to make a periodic automatic check for smartscreen links.
If the link goes dead, we need to automatically resend the file to FTP.
Link status should be shown with color and indicator (OK/Alert!).
Link status should be automatically updated by AJAX.
When the link fades, should be initiated automatically re-pouring the file on FTP, with the issuance of a link and update on AJAX.

The frequency of the smartscreen file test is once every 10 minutes.

2020-07-15T19:04:04 strix -> bentley
buza suggested it to me today -- I googled and found the service https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search -- as I understand it, browsers use it to check

2020-07-15T19:04:47 strix -> bentley
You can open this page in selenium, fill in the form, and check the result of the query

2020-07-15T19:06:40 bentley -> strix
As I understand it, it's the site itself that checks, not directly the link to the file. This is slightly different.

2020-07-15T19:07:14 strix -> bentley
There you enter a link into the form, and the site checks it

2020-07-15T19:07:40 strix -> bentley
By the way, the files you gave the error does not show up here either

2020-07-15T19:08:02 bentley -> strix
Here. Google site said ok but on download - danger

2020-07-15T19:08:33 strix -> bentley

2020-08-07T13:03:39 strix -> bentley
hi

2020-08-07T13:03:51 strix -> bentley
I'll try

https://173.232.146.236/phpvirtualbox/

2020-08-07T13:05:19 bentley -> strix
Can't log on to the 2019 server

2020-08-07T13:05:52 bentley -> strix
Just hangs on the login screen there you have to press ctrl + alt + del

2020-08-07T13:06:01 bentley -> strix
And the rdp is not forwarded.

2020-08-07T13:08:02 strix -> bentley
hanging?

2020-08-07T13:08:36 bentley -> strix
It just won't go in, that's all.

2020-08-07T13:24:04 strix -> bentley
it was knocked out.

2020-08-07T13:24:17 strix -> bentley
I'm running it again right now.

2020-08-07T13:25:14 bentley -> strix
Yeah. Try logging into it. Last time green set up auto login so you don't have to enter your username/password

2020-08-07T13:25:21 bentley -> strix
On the other 2019

2020-08-07T13:33:14 strix -> bentley
what is her username/password?

2020-08-07T13:33:37 bentley -> strix
Administrator/JohnJackson21

2020-08-07T13:33:40 bentley -> strix
Think

2020-08-07T13:37:59 strix -> bentley
What rdp client do you have?

2020-08-07T13:38:14 bentley -> strix
The usual vinyl.

2020-08-07T13:38:44 strix -> bentley
In freerdp CAD catches, but in remmina it does not for some reason

2020-08-07T13:38:59 strix -> bentley
logged in

2020-08-07T13:40:03 bentley -> strix
I think there is a command control userpasswords2 to log in without a password

2020-08-07T13:42:39 strix -> bentley
 comstroke?

2020-08-07T13:42:49 bentley -> strix
Or in the wound.

2020-08-07T13:42:49 strix -> bentley
in the comstroke?

2020-08-07T13:43:05 strix -> bentley
In what wound?

2020-08-07T13:43:12 bentley -> strix
run

2020-08-07T13:43:25 bentley -> strix
WIN + R

2020-08-07T13:43:32 strix -> bentley
and you mean the start menu?

2020-08-07T13:44:13 bentley -> strix
Runs on the command line, too

2020-08-07T13:47:30 strix -> bentley
Yep, control userpasswords2 works

2020-08-07T13:47:55 strix -> bentley
the dialog pops up where you should have unchecked the passwords checkbox

2020-08-07T13:48:23 bentley -> strix
Yeah, so it doesn't require a username and password

2020-08-07T13:49:52 strix -> bentley
rebooted -- no password asked

2020-08-07T13:50:03 bentley -> strix
Great!

2020-08-07T13:50:06 bentley -> strix
Just what I needed!

2020-09-28T20:18:31 bentley -> strix
Hi

2020-09-28T20:18:44 bentley -> strix
Polskazka, how do you check that the gaskets work?

2020-09-28T20:26:15 strix -> bentley
which pads?

I don't know how these gaskets work and what these gaskets work for

2020-09-28T20:29:06 strix -> bentley
so you can't tell right away

2020-09-28T20:29:18 bentley -> strix
Green's kicking?

2020-09-28T20:29:33 strix -> bentley
Probably, if he was making them.

2020-09-28T20:29:52 bentley -> strix
Yeah, he's in the offing. Wrote to Defender, too.

2020-09-28T20:30:14 strix -> bentley
Well, knock on deender's door.

2020-09-28T20:30:24 strix -> bentley
UAH seems to be offline now.

2020-09-28T20:31:05 bentley -> strix
Yep
