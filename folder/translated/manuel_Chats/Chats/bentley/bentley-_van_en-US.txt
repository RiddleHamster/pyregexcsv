Hi! I built version 122 this morning, checked on autotest - all clear. Loider has 2 working pads left, the third one is green there, but it's not our server responding. So I'm waiting for what Buza has to say.

2020-06-22T07:06:39 bentley -> van
Ok

2020-06-22T07:09:46 van -> bentley
Bitdefender glitched in the autotest yesterday. Gave out red, even though there was a knockout. I ran it again and connected to the VM. No detects, everything works, but extremely slow. There was a knockout, the getinfo command was picked up, but didn't have time to execute... Bitdef is working today... Keep in mind.

2020-06-22T07:10:05 bentley -> van
Got it. Thanks )

2020-06-22T08:03:50 van -> bentley

I put together a backdoor with new gaskets. Pouring it in?

2020-06-22T09:05:36 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-06-22T09:06:50 van -> bentley
I'll check in the autotest?

Yep. no borrowing yet.

2020-06-22T09:07:07 van -> bentley
I'll be quick

2020-06-22T09:37:21 van -> bentley

Cryptem?

2020-06-22T09:38:03 van -> bentley
No, I checked it with the exe loafer

2020-06-22T09:38:19 bentley -> van
Do you have to crypt?

2020-06-22T09:38:50 van -> bentley
no bot, and I sent you the dll for crypting

2020-06-22T09:39:04 bentley -> van
Ok

2020-06-22T12:29:42 van -> bentley
something going on?

2020-06-22T12:29:58 bentley -> van
I'm updating the AV.

2020-06-22T12:30:12 bentley -> van
Then I will test the crypt

2020-06-22T12:30:51 van -> bentley

did you do something with the crypt?

2020-06-22T15:23:14 bentley -> van
Just ran it on autotest

2020-06-22T15:23:25 van -> bentley

2020-06-22T15:23:49 van -> bentley
Booza said that crypto is needed for the upgrade.

2020-06-22T15:24:12 bentley -> van
For the update?

2020-06-22T15:24:28 van -> bentley

You updated the AV, now the detects will fall... Clean it tomorrow, I'll leave now, it's already the second shift )))

Something about the autotest is glitchy, I think. When you test it, we'll see... Are you going to test crypt today?

Listen, here's the thing. I have another backdoor, to work through a local proxy. It needs to be tested for functionality on all the commands. Let's test what I sent, and then we need to upload a new backdoor, run the loader manually and run it in a full circle. And this is urgent, Booza wants to get this new backdoor working on Monday. Can we do it?

On the virtual box server it is called Webroot win10

2020-07-15T10:37:49 van -> bentley
Yep

2020-07-15T10:50:10 van -> bentley
I got disconnected from the VM and can't connect anymore ...

2020-07-15T10:50:42 van -> bentley
I will restart the VM.

2020-07-15T10:50:49 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-07-15T10:51:48 van -> bentley
I will manually try to run the loeder

2020-07-15T10:51:56 bentley -> van
Ok

2020-07-15T11:06:22 van -> bentley
Look, I turned off the VM when the autotest wasn't over yet. Turned it on, logged in, and what I see: from the scramble loader started. Tapped the bot, the command I gave him - everything is fine.

2020-07-15T11:06:56 van -> bentley
Can you roll back the VM to check again?

2020-07-15T11:07:10 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-07-15T11:07:24 van -> bentley
I'm confused by your kickbacks )))

2020-07-15T11:07:24 bentley -> van
rolled back

2020-07-15T11:07:34 van -> bentley
how so fast!!!

2020-07-15T11:08:00 bentley -> van
Yes there is a button to press to restore the image and that's it

2020-07-15T11:08:43 van -> bentley
where is that button???

2020-07-15T11:10:22 bentley -> van
Choose a car - Top right Snapshots - Select Snapshot Number (number of minutes) highlight it and click above button restore snapshot

2020-07-15T11:10:51 van -> bentley
Ahhhh, that's it... 

2020-07-15T11:41:16 van -> bentley
All bad. From zakrepa everything was fine, i.e. the dynamics is normal, but the disk from the archive does not allow to pull - tear down. I must try to cripto pick up. If it does not work, I will try to look for what screams.

2020-07-15T11:42:09 bentley -> van
I'll write to Deploy.

2020-07-15T11:46:03 van -> bentley
are you crypting the dll?

2020-07-15T11:46:31 bentley -> van
yes gave the dll

2020-07-15T11:46:39 bentley -> van
Deploy, says redo.

2020-07-15T11:46:50 van -> bentley
OK, we'll check it out.

2020-07-15T11:51:05 bentley -> van

2020-07-15T12:04:14 van -> bentley
is the autotest broken?

2020-07-15T12:27:26 van -> bentley

2020-07-15T12:27:54 bentley -> van
Are you going to redo it?

2020-07-15T12:28:53 van -> bentley
I will, but it takes a long time, so you try something too, or use as is. Webroots don't stand for anything.

2020-07-15T12:29:04 bentley -> van
Ok

2020-07-15T12:30:04 van -> bentley

2020-07-17T07:12:09 van -> bentley
Is Swift's functionality okay?

2020-07-17T07:12:17 bentley -> van
On the def, yes.

2020-07-17T07:12:24 bentley -> van

Hi. Okay

2020-07-21T06:51:31 van -> bentley
I have a question. Are you testing modular bots?

2020-07-21T06:51:42 bentley -> van
How's that?

2020-07-21T06:51:51 bentley -> van
Are you referring to the trike?

2020-07-21T06:53:02 van -> bentley
I have it called modular bot in my TOR). It runs dll-modules, which it downloads from the admin area of some kind.

2020-07-21T06:53:50 van -> bentley
Buza said that there is an autotest run for it - you choose Regular

2020-07-21T06:54:29 bentley -> van
Oh well, then yes. That's me.

2020-07-21T06:55:48 van -> bentley
I wrote this bot three months ago. I tested it in chunks, of course, but not as a whole. Not sure how best to approach this testing. Can you help?

2020-07-21T06:56:30 bentley -> van
Yes. Describe what this bot does

2020-07-21T06:57:15 bentley -> van
What dlls does it load? Is there a loading sequence?

2020-07-21T06:57:19 van -> bentley
Why don't I just send you the ToR? There's a lot written there.

2020-07-21T06:57:26 bentley -> van
Come on ))

2020-07-21T06:57:32 van -> bentley
Thanks!!!!!!!

2020-07-21T06:57:44 bentley -> van
Let's test it today

2020-07-21T06:57:55 van -> bentley
I'll get it ready in a minute. Great!

2020-07-21T06:59:18 van -> bentley
Buza suggested yesterday that I finish this bot while there's a lull with the hackers. So I blew the whistle. )))

2020-07-21T06:59:47 bentley -> van
Great!!! I love the movement and new assignments ))

In the folder TK and bot. In the TK, there is also a lowader, but I have not written it yet, only the bot. In general, in the TOR
A lot is written, not everything was for me. Check it out, maybe you can check something...

2020-07-21T07:50:36 bentley -> van
ok

2020-07-21T07:56:30 van -> bentley
Also. The modular bot has a basic built-in config with addresses. Maybe they are out of date. In general, it will be seen. Better to run a logged one, I guess...

2020-07-21T08:01:02 bentley -> van
okay

2020-07-21T08:41:29 van -> bentley
You know what else. Please upload a newer crypto loader x64 to the admin area, there's an old one with dead addresses. Maybe someone will upgrade.

Talar creates a group, gives Swift access to it, Swift pulls the paths from the group, loads them into a looder and builds the assembly for the group.

2020-08-28T08:28:48 van -> bentley
In group 1 uploaded backdoor workable, but really change to a new one before the test too.
There are some glitches with the uploaded files in the admin, saw more than once in gr 1.
Gr. 1 I cleaned of junk and now there filled one file, marked grocery and test.
I usually poured two of the same in product and test and marked one for one, the other for the other.
After a day or two, one of the files would fly off. I would turn it in to Talar. I don't know if he fixed it.
The last time Talar just marked one file twice - I don't know how to do that...
Anyway, gotta watch the files in the groups... )))

2020-08-28T08:29:47 bentley -> van
Yeah had run into that too. Haven't fixed it yet, will check before I start.

2020-08-28T08:30:45 van -> bentley

The database is updated every 4-5 hours

2020-09-02T13:29:02 van -> bentley
is there an update somewhere in defender?

2020-09-02T13:29:31 bentley -> van
Yes through the service - update os you can check

2020-09-02T13:29:36 bentley -> van
update

2020-09-02T13:47:12 van -> bentley
Look, are we really in a bad place?

2020-09-02T13:47:55 bentley -> van
Yours and Mashrum's BK are straying. I got the propisdon from the Boss for not checking correctly.

2020-09-02T13:48:00 bentley -> van
We'll get through it.)

2020-09-02T13:48:54 van -> bentley
So, are our uk's in the works or are they only staring at tests?

2020-09-02T13:49:43 bentley -> van
Yeah on tests. Haven't taken it to work yet. It's still on the test.

2020-09-03T07:19:20 van -> bentley

2020-09-03T18:39:23 bentley -> van
 So. 10 and 2019 all worked without detects, latched on and worked after reboot. 7 worked but went offline after reboot.

2020-09-08T16:02:06 van -> bentley
How are we doing? Stern is pressing a little...

2020-09-08T16:03:31 van -> bentley
Didn't Stern ask you about our fiasco?

2020-09-08T16:04:40 bentley -> van
 <Stern> what's going on with the bk?
[23:03:12] <bentley> admin is working. There was a problem with encryption Defender stole names related to Document name. Problem solved by issuing Target 1 crypt. 3 more on the way.

2020-09-08T16:04:54 bentley -> van
On it on sofos detection I am hesitant what to do

2020-09-08T16:05:00 bentley -> van
I will give out

2020-09-08T16:05:43 bentley -> van
Give out with sofosm?

2020-09-08T16:05:47 bentley -> van
Can you fix it?

2020-09-08T16:05:52 van -> bentley
On Sophos, I think the admin doesn't always give out hetinfo and the autotest fails

2020-09-08T16:06:11 van -> bentley
I had Sophos working in the morning and in the evening, too

2020-09-08T16:06:42 bentley -> van
Ok

2020-09-08T16:06:52 bentley -> van
It's on the o1 group

2020-09-08T16:07:07 van -> bentley
in the morning on gr 1

2020-09-08T16:07:16 van -> bentley
tonight on o1

2020-09-08T16:07:46 van -> bentley
Yes they are the same code

2020-09-08T16:09:13 bentley -> van
You gave it away or else you're fucked)

2020-09-08T16:09:24 bentley -> van
Let's see what they have to say on their tests

2020-09-08T16:11:40 van -> bentley
Yeah they won't say anything good. You see I clean, no detects. Upgraded AV - there is a detection. Antivirus is easier to live with. They can overdetect, and nothing bad will happen. But we are in trouble from their steamy.

2020-09-08T16:12:45 bentley -> van
Target said that the last test build was ok in terms of cleanliness

2020-09-08T16:14:00 van -> bentley
Yes this cleanliness is for 10 minutes...

2020-09-08T16:14:55 van -> bentley
When will they test it and tell you?

2020-09-08T16:15:39 bentley -> van
Yes they will.

2020-09-08T16:16:34 van -> bentley
today?

2020-09-08T16:16:58 bentley -> van
Yeah I hope so.

2020-09-08T16:17:41 van -> bentley
I'm already off my feet, please write off if there's anything...

2020-09-08T16:18:11 bentley -> van
Yeah sure. Please tell me how to check the fix on your build to speed up my testing

2020-09-08T16:18:18 bentley -> van
Not chasing everything.

2020-09-08T16:19:33 van -> bentley
As soon as you tap the bk, you can restart the VM immediately. Zakrep gets up as soon as the bk is downloaded.

2020-09-08T16:19:50 van -> bentley
no commands need to be given at all to check the fixing

2020-09-08T16:19:58 bentley -> van
Getsinfo or just a bot showed up in the admin area?

2020-09-08T16:20:03 bentley -> van
Ah ok

2020-09-08T16:20:23 van -> bentley
as soon as it appeared, gethinfo is not needed either

2020-09-08T16:20:36 bentley -> van
Ok

2020-09-08T16:21:50 van -> bentley
the first time you bk comes out Message : VerBD 147 VerLD 148 93.189.46.41:443 uptime 4
restart the VM and wait for the same message again - it came - there is a start from zakrepa

2020-09-08T16:22:26 bentley -> van
got it

2020-09-08T16:23:37 van -> bentley
I'm off...

2020-09-08T16:24:01 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-09-09T06:43:54 bentley -> van
Hi.

2020-09-09T06:43:56 van -> bentley
Hi there, you made it. ))) How are we in trouble? Is it universal?

2020-09-09T06:44:16 bentley -> van
Made a stable crypt in the evening

2020-09-09T06:44:32 bentley -> van
Deploy complains about the name change and the detector in doing so

2020-09-09T06:45:04 bentley -> van
I noticed that too. You change the name of the source to Documents and it's panic.

2020-09-09T06:45:16 van -> bentley
here's how

2020-09-09T06:45:25 bentley -> van
Say, can you make an assembly with 4 groups with these names:

2020-09-09T06:45:27 bentley -> van
Preview
Print_Preview
Review
PreviewDoc
Preview_Doc

2020-09-09T06:46:11 van -> bentley
I don't understand about the names... So rename manually as needed

2020-09-09T06:46:47 bentley -> van
When renaming it, that's where the panic started

2020-09-09T06:47:45 van -> bentley
What should I do with these names? I don't get it... ))) I'm dumb...

2020-09-09T06:48:28 bentley -> van
If you try to make loader builds with these names.

2020-09-09T06:48:39 bentley -> van
I want to check how it will be encrypted

2020-09-09T06:50:01 van -> bentley
Now the loader is called ld1.exe, rename it to PreviewDocs.exe and crypto. I don't get it anyway (((

2020-09-09T06:50:19 bentley -> van
When you rename it, it starts palying on the def

2020-09-09T06:50:31 bentley -> van
The source code itself is compromised.

2020-09-09T06:50:37 van -> bentley
Okay, wait, wait.

2020-09-09T06:50:46 bentley -> van
with ld1 - ok and with the document immediately detected

2020-09-09T06:50:50 van -> bentley
you crypt the dll &

2020-09-09T06:50:57 van -> bentley
?

2020-09-09T06:50:58 bentley -> van


2020-09-09T06:51:29 van -> bentley
look, they used to think that crypto was better than dll

2020-09-09T06:52:57 bentley -> van
So then a question. Is it possible to check the dll?

2020-09-09T06:53:00 bentley -> van
Source

2020-09-09T06:53:35 van -> bentley
The dll can only be checked for statics

2020-09-09T06:53:52 bentley -> van
And for the launch?

2020-09-09T06:53:58 bentley -> van
And the blowout?

2020-09-09T06:54:08 van -> bentley
only after crypting, of course

2020-09-09T06:54:22 van -> bentley
That's what they used to do.

2020-09-09T06:54:24 bentley -> van
the dll itself - no yes?

2020-09-09T06:54:43 bentley -> van
Okay, we'll make a dll today.

2020-09-09T06:54:47 van -> bentley
the dll itself can't be run just like that

2020-09-09T06:55:14 bentley -> van
Got it

2020-09-09T06:55:55 van -> bentley
so dlls were crypting and everyone seemed to be happy in June, i haven't even asked for a long time what you're crypting. I send dlls every time.

2020-09-09T06:56:10 van -> bentley
Try it, really.

2020-09-09T06:56:20 bentley -> van
Ok

2020-09-09T06:57:55 van -> bentley
By the way, why they yell at exe when renaming is not clear. There is no line inside the exe with the name of the file itself ld1.exe, for example. Mystery.

2020-09-09T06:58:31 bentley -> van
Booza said yesterday that certain names of echoes are prescribed in the av policy

2020-09-09T06:59:05 van -> bentley
then don't use those names )))

2020-09-09T06:59:12 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-09-09T06:59:17 van -> bentley
Okay, let's check the dll.

2020-09-09T06:59:18 bentley -> van
Today we will do with dll crypta

2020-09-09T06:59:40 van -> bentley
What did Target test yesterday?

2020-09-09T06:59:56 bentley -> van
seems to be ok.

2020-09-09T07:00:38 van -> bentley
They understand there that if it's ok, then you have to get into the fight, because the lowder doesn't live clean for long, so what's the point of getting it soured?

2020-09-09T07:00:57 bentley -> van
Yes to the fight today.

2020-09-09T07:01:21 van -> bentley
good luck to us all

2020-09-09T07:01:32 bentley -> van
Yes

2020-09-09T07:02:28 van -> bentley
Stern must have said something to Booze's ass yesterday too. It hit everyone.

2020-09-09T07:02:44 bentley -> van
yes

2020-09-09T07:02:47 bentley -> van

Checked it this morning. Yes, under defender is flipping again. Cleaned it up. Checked it - it works.
Builds loaders cleaned and assembled. Backdoors didn't change. Addresses in the looper and backdoor didn't change either.
Try crypting, the product is perishable - there's a whole AV industry against me alone.

2020-09-15T06:39:10 bentley -> van
Separately removed the office turns out to be more focused on the case and there is a sense that going to work switches the mind and takes work more seriously.

2020-09-15T06:49:36 van -> bentley
before that as an engineer, chief engineer

2020-09-15T06:49:50 bentley -> van
Cool!

2020-09-15T06:50:53 bentley -> van
Then I have a question. Is it possible for a private telecommunications company to beat a mastadont like Rostelecom in Russia?

2020-09-15T06:53:03 van -> bentley
You know, the order that the current rulers have imposed (trading positions, contempt for people of labor) has made me completely nervous and exhausted. Bitches.
Er-Telecom is an example of such a company.
Headquartered in Perm. The owner is Kuzyaev, a former oilman.
For example, in St. Petersburg, he is the leading operator.

2020-09-15T06:55:34 bentley -> van
That's what I'm talking about too, that nasty soviet parasitic bureaucracy. Because our Country has so much potential. Or rather our Russian people, but these scum have been sucking our strength for hundreds of years and we are not going anywhere, we are living on the level of survival. And we could be a leading high-tech power where our people can live well and free.

2020-09-15T06:56:27 van -> bentley

Another question. What about the autotest? I don't think it's working. I got the access.

2020-09-15T07:30:07 bentley -> van
It's not working. It's being fixed.

2020-09-15T07:30:16 van -> bentley
thanks

2020-09-15T08:05:26 bentley -> van
Testing. Remind me again how the fixing works?

2020-09-15T08:08:12 van -> bentley
once knocked off, you can reboot, you already have an anchor. After starting from the zap there will be a message in the bot again

you don't need to give any commands unless you're checking the clip

2020-09-15T08:09:37 bentley -> van
Yeah, I already launched Getsinfo and I'll wait for it to work out.

2020-09-15T08:28:49 bentley -> van
Weird. something doesn't work after the fix for 10 and 2019

2020-09-15T08:28:53 bentley -> van
at 7 - ok

2020-09-15T08:29:28 bentley -> van
no detects

2020-09-15T08:30:09 van -> bentley
I checked the 10_64_05_2 fix today - it was fine

2020-09-15T08:30:40 van -> bentley
Is the loeder in place in 10 and 2019 ?

2020-09-15T08:30:49 van -> bentley
Or was it blown away?

2020-09-15T08:31:04 van -> bentley
Maybe wait a little longer?

2020-09-15T08:31:20 bentley -> van
No, where I started it, it's there.

2020-09-15T08:31:24 bentley -> van
yes, I'm waiting

2020-09-15T08:31:56 van -> bentley
is it in the processes? or/and cmd.exe &

2020-09-15T08:31:57 van -> bentley
?

2020-09-15T08:32:07 bentley -> van
so

2020-09-15T08:32:26 van -> bentley
no detects - the main thing, and not demolished

2020-09-15T08:33:13 bentley -> van
Yep, we're waiting

2020-09-15T08:36:00 van -> bentley
Try another reboot if we can't wait

2020-09-15T08:36:18 bentley -> van
Yep, another 10 minutes.

2020-09-15T08:36:28 van -> bentley
What kind of car is the 10? I'd like to see

2020-09-15T08:37:06 bentley -> van
Yes, I can give it to you via timecode.

2020-09-15T08:39:31 bentley -> van
I'm watching crypto.

2020-09-15T08:39:54 van -> bentley
you can give the bitsadmin /list command on the command line

2020-09-15T08:40:18 van -> bentley
will there be something about Adobe in the answer ?

2020-09-15T08:40:33 bentley -> van
yes

2020-09-15T08:40:51 van -> bentley
and the crypto loader is in place?

2020-09-15T08:41:38 van -> bentley
Actually, in 3 hours there will be a re-run of the loader from the bits

2020-09-15T08:41:56 van -> bentley

here's the request

2020-09-15T08:43:32 van -> bentley
it's okay

2020-09-15T08:44:05 van -> bentley
there are a lot of jobs in the bits that didn't make it to us

2020-09-15T08:45:17 van -> bentley
Usually 1 or 2 tasks, but there are 43

2020-09-15T08:46:22 van -> bentley
I think it's okay, no detection, the loader is in place, the job is there - it will run

2020-09-15T08:47:15 van -> bentley
Let's wait for interest, maybe you'll do something else in the meantime...

2020-09-15T08:48:18 bentley -> van
Yeah ok

2020-09-15T09:06:48 van -> bentley
I also run t1 in mine, just to control it. Maybe there's something in the admin...

2020-09-15T09:06:59 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-09-15T09:24:06 van -> bentley
It bounced and it bounced from scratch, and it's fine in the admin area.

2020-09-15T09:24:15 bentley -> van

2020-09-15T09:25:30 bentley -> van
Okay )

2020-09-15T09:25:51 van -> bentley

2020-09-15T09:26:02 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-09-15T09:26:24 van -> bentley
I'm going to step back for a bit.

2020-09-15T10:33:45 van -> bentley
Yep, got it, now I'm going to try mine first

2020-09-15T10:38:34 van -> bentley
And there are r1 bots there now. Did you start it up again?

2020-09-15T10:38:56 bentley -> van
Yes also 2 crypts on 6 machines

2020-09-15T10:39:13 bentley -> van
Bots are not deleted because they take old groups

2020-09-15T10:39:17 van -> bentley
Yep

2020-09-15T10:41:03 bentley -> van
On 7, it works like clockwork, but not on 10 and 2019

2020-09-15T10:41:25 van -> bentley
check out

2020-09-15T10:47:20 van -> bentley
mine started from scratch, so there's no claims to crypto...
can i take my car 10_64_05_2 to check?

2020-09-15T10:47:36 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-09-15T10:47:46 van -> bentley
I'll write back with the result

2020-09-15T10:47:50 bentley -> van
ok

2020-09-15T11:03:31 van -> bentley
On 10_64_05_2 the crypt blew up on manual start, no detection messages.
Rolled it back, now I will check the uncrypted one on this machine.

2020-09-15T11:04:27 bentley -> van
also my test one only through timka

2020-09-15T11:04:47 van -> bentley
No, I did something wrong... tapped the bot.

2020-09-15T11:04:58 van -> bentley
I rolled it back, man.

2020-09-15T11:05:05 van -> bentley
Trying again

2020-09-15T11:06:57 van -> bentley
Krypt appeared in the list of processes when I started, and then disappeared, but it was in the folder, i.e. it's not AV, it turns out. Disappeared, but bot loaded later? Crypt, by any chance, does not rename itself at startup?

What's up?

2020-09-15T11:42:08 van -> bentley
The logic of the crypt has changed, which is why I stopped fixing it via bits. I'll fix it, it's my flaw. Under 7th one more tack works, so it works there. I'll start fixing it now. It'll probably take me an evening, I'll try to be quicker.

2020-09-15T11:42:32 bentley -> van

[22:46:46] <Stern> not crypto

[22:53:25] <Stern> was it always known?
[22:53:54] <bentley> No before that everything was fine yesterday and last week
[22:54:07] <Stern> and how so checks the targeting)
[22:54:11] <Stern> what does it tear down
[22:54:43] <bentley> Another nuance just the encript's runtime is clean by defender Target check by downloading from shelves through chrome
[22:55:02] <bentley> it's not really random and not exactly corp av on which we cleaned
[22:55:37] <bentley> There's also the reputation of the sites and google cloud avs overlaying into this situation
[22:56:01] <Stern> and you can also clean and check how targeting does it
[22:56:04] <Stern> since it checks so
[22:56:08] <Stern> that's how he sends out

2020-09-16T16:41:29 van -> bentley
It wasn't like that yesterday...geez... but it's a crypto kind of thing

2020-09-16T16:41:38 bentley -> van
And so is the ancrypt.

2020-09-16T16:41:48 bentley -> van
I checked unencrypted all 5 pcs.

2020-09-16T16:42:06 van -> bentley
clearly

2020-09-16T16:43:02 bentley -> van
Now on top of everything else will be added to check for downloads from ftp. Most likely

2020-09-16T16:57:53 van -> bentley
So you have nothing to work with today?

2020-09-16T16:58:15 van -> bentley
Ancrypt also stinks, you say.

2020-09-16T16:59:04 bentley -> van
Yep.

2020-09-16T16:59:04 bentley -> van
Can't get a clean start

2020-09-16T16:59:58 van -> bentley

2020-09-16T17:00:36 bentley -> van
I see

2020-09-16T17:17:11 van -> bentley
I've now run the loader in VM 10_64_05_2, knocked it out, Defender is silent. Rebooted, waiting. What's wrong with it?

2020-09-16T17:17:39 bentley -> van
 <bentley> It's not really rantime and not soavslly corp avs that we cleaned up
[22:55:37] <bentley> There's also the reputation of the sites and google cloud avs overlaying into this situation

2020-09-16T17:18:14 bentley -> van
It downloads from the link and detects when you save it

2020-09-16T17:18:24 bentley -> van
https://alwaslegypt.com/Preview.exe

2020-09-16T17:19:37 van -> bentley
but we don't cancel the check under Defender, Defender has cloud enabled, updated...

2020-09-16T17:20:03 bentley -> van
No we don't.

2020-09-16T17:38:56 van -> bentley
knocked out of the scramble

2020-09-16T17:39:09 van -> bentley
what to do?

2020-09-16T17:39:28 bentley -> van

2020-09-18T06:55:25 bentley -> van

2020-09-18T06:55:25 van -> bentley
Autotest didn't work this morning. Manually wanted to start the car with def - blocked it says, the other VM panel couldn't open at all. Kind of a depressing morning for me.

2020-09-18T06:55:29 bentley -> van
one is better

2020-09-18T06:55:46 bentley -> van
The cryptoranel is working right now.

2020-09-18T06:55:52 van -> bentley
Okay, I'll put it together now.

2020-09-18T06:56:06 van -> bentley

2020-09-18T06:56:14 van -> bentley

I'll be looking for the problem this weekend.

2020-09-18T16:37:26 bentley -> van
Strange how it works for me on 10 and for my tester on 2019

2020-09-18T16:37:33 bentley -> van
And I'm off again for 2019.

2020-09-18T16:40:11 van -> bentley
Yeah, it's weird...

2020-09-18T16:43:47 bentley -> van
And the bot tapped out on all 3 cars

2020-09-18T16:43:55 van -> bentley
yes

2020-09-18T16:43:58 van -> bentley
I see

2020-09-18T16:44:18 bentley -> van
It will probably die on reboot.

2020-09-18T16:44:25 bentley -> van
Record with the logs?

2020-09-18T16:45:02 van -> bentley
No, no logging is not an option, I haven't configured the compiler yet

2020-09-18T16:45:37 bentley -> van

2020-09-18T16:45:42 van -> bentley
I'll run it myself tomorrow.

Okay

2020-09-18T16:46:00 van -> bentley
Reboot.

2020-09-18T16:46:22 bentley -> van

2020-09-18T16:47:16 van -> bentley

Here is the helper bot and it has no detection for 2019 as it says

2020-09-18T16:53:04 van -> bentley
I don't see this bot on the list

2020-09-18T16:54:16 bentley -> van
I can see it. Weird

2020-09-18T16:57:02 van -> bentley
saw it, it's not in the test ones.

2020-09-18T16:57:23 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-09-18T16:57:34 van -> bentley
so he needs to reboot too

2020-09-18T16:58:10 van -> bentley
So he's already been rebooted, it looks like.

2020-09-18T16:58:17 bentley -> van
yes

2020-09-18T16:58:51 van -> bentley
then you need to check if defender is updated, if the cloud is enabled

2020-09-18T16:59:02 bentley -> van
yes

2020-09-18T17:00:33 van -> bentley

2020-09-18T17:01:02 van -> bentley
And the third one seems to be dead.

2020-09-18T17:16:38 van -> bentley

2020-09-22T15:14:50 van -> bentley
Do you send in the dincheck for crypt dynamics?

2020-09-22T15:20:21 van -> bentley
You know, I think all our troubles started with turning on the cloud and checking the dynamics on the dincheck. We leak our own code. We clean it up, we leak it again. We can't get out of this circle. We need to test without the cloud and stay away from the dynamics on the dincheck. And when we go into battle, let everyone have the cloud on, it will not be ready, the loader will at least load the bot. And so we ourselves train the cloud AV.

2020-09-22T15:29:16 van -> bentley
I've got 100500 words on Target right now... In a nutshell, me and Mashrum are going to do the least looder possible by Friday. We'll remove everything from the loeder, which isn't necessary for one-time loading of BC. I'll build one tomorrow. We'll see.

2020-09-22T15:29:52 bentley -> van
Okay

2020-09-22T15:30:25 van -> bentley

2020-09-25T06:46:20 bentley -> van
Yeah good!

2020-09-25T06:47:44 van -> bentley
Target said they will be working at 1pm. Will we make it with the cryptos?

2020-09-25T06:49:18 van -> bentley
How did they do yesterday? Did Target stomp their feet or was it quiet?

2020-09-25T06:49:33 bentley -> van
I think it's okay. Didn't swear))

Your lowers are working.

2020-09-25T13:11:12 van -> bentley
Anything working out?

2020-09-25T13:13:20 bentley -> van
Yes, it's downloading.

2020-09-25T13:13:33 van -> bentley

2020-09-25T18:08:31 bentley -> van
Target complained that bots die quickly. A lot.

2020-09-25T18:09:18 bentley -> van
He was cursing a lot. Said where he saw us...

2020-09-25T18:16:17 bentley -> van
I think they managed to upload most of it to the coba

2020-09-28T05:33:32 van -> bentley
Hi! ))) There's an important thing )))

2020-09-28T05:33:49 van -> bentley
Was Target yelling a lot on Friday?

2020-09-28T05:33:55 bentley -> van
No

2020-09-28T05:34:20 van -> bentley
didn't yell at me at all.

2020-09-28T05:34:27 van -> bentley
here's the thing

2020-09-28T05:34:36 bentley -> van
Well shouted at me )

2020-09-28T05:35:03 van -> bentley
We need to get everything back together by 12 Moscow time.

2020-09-28T05:35:09 bentley -> van
Yes

2020-09-28T05:35:26 van -> bentley
And two more Mashroom loaders

2020-09-28T05:35:45 van -> bentley
and he's not there yet.

2020-09-28T05:35:53 van -> bentley
And now for the main thing.

2020-09-28T05:36:17 van -> bentley
I will assemble 6 loaders, each with one address

2020-09-28T05:36:38 van -> bentley
And there are 6 backdoors, each with the same address

2020-09-28T05:36:48 van -> bentley
i.e. loeder+backdoor pair

2020-09-28T05:37:17 van -> bentley
when they change the loader in the job, you have to pour in a new backdoor as well

2020-09-28T05:37:50 van -> bentley
the addresses are supposed to live longer this way

2020-09-28T05:38:07 bentley -> van
Got it.

2020-09-28T05:39:11 van -> bentley
And, in addition to the 6 loaders and 6 backdoors, I'll send you another backdoor with yesterday's addresses, you upload it for the loader tests.

2020-09-28T05:39:28 van -> bentley
I'll mark it as a test one.

2020-09-28T05:39:31 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-09-28T05:40:07 van -> bentley
i.e. backdoors don't shine at all before work, you fill the first backdoor before you start work

2020-09-28T05:41:30 van -> bentley
well and the numbers of loaders and backdoors don't matter. You can work with the 1st loider and the 6th backdoor, as long as you change the backdoor when you change the backdoor. There is no need to synchronize looder and backdoor numbers.

2020-09-28T05:42:20 bentley -> van
So bk and loader have different addresses? Then how do they find each other?

2020-09-28T05:42:43 van -> bentley
Lowders and backdoors have a different set of addresses

2020-09-28T05:44:07 van -> bentley
the loader knows how to download the backdoor, the backdoor doesn't know anything about the loader and it sends queries to its own address to the admin. I wanted to tell you all about it, but I haven't got around to it yet...(((

2020-09-28T05:45:07 van -> bentley
What about Mashroom?

2020-09-28T05:45:15 bentley -> van
Not urgent

2020-09-28T05:45:21 bentley -> van
Waiting to see how it arrives.

2020-09-28T05:45:36 van -> bentley
I'm waiting for addresses from Greene right now and will get everything together.

2020-09-28T05:46:22 bentley -> van
Okay

2020-09-28T06:32:23 van -> bentley
By the way, there is no signature in the admin, nothing will work yet. Talar is not there yet.

2020-09-28T06:32:46 bentley -> van
Waiting for Booza.

2020-09-28T06:34:15 bentley -> van
Hmmm.

2020-09-28T07:05:19 van -> bentley
you disappear all the time )))

2020-09-28T07:05:31 bentley -> van
Yes, I'm setting up a new VPN.

2020-09-28T07:05:37 van -> bentley
ahh

2020-09-28T07:06:02 bentley -> van
I'll stick with the old one for now.

2020-09-28T07:06:20 van -> bentley

2020-09-28T07:06:31 bentley -> van
It's just not clear how the new psi works there

2020-09-28T07:07:07 van -> bentley
I have an assembly in progress, I'll be done soon

6 different lowers at the same time

2020-09-28T11:15:55 van -> bentley
Not at the same time, of course. Work the first loader and the first bk, then fill the second bk and work the second loader

2020-09-28T11:16:02 van -> bentley
etc. to the sixth

2020-09-28T11:16:26 van -> bentley

I think you need to check the lockdriver manually. I don't remember such a detection before. After 7 minutes??? The loader is already unloaded in that time and the backdoor is working.

2020-09-29T09:35:52 bentley -> van
Ok, I'll check it out.

2020-09-29T09:36:52 van -> bentley
and gethinfo performs?

2020-09-29T09:37:40 bentley -> van
YES I did

2020-09-29T09:38:01 van -> bentley
didn't have that detection yesterday?

2020-09-29T09:38:27 bentley -> van
No it wasn't.

2020-09-29T09:38:31 van -> bentley
7 minutes confuses me.

2020-09-29T09:38:35 bentley -> van
I'm going to run the source code now.

2020-09-29T09:38:49 van -> bentley
Yep

2020-09-29T09:39:38 van -> bentley
It's probably nothing to do with the crypt after 7 minutes.

2020-09-29T09:40:27 bentley -> van
Yeah, so now it will also detect

2020-09-29T09:40:39 van -> bentley
yes most likely

2020-09-29T09:40:55 van -> bentley
I'm going to clean it, what can I say...

Nope

2020-09-29T10:09:31 van -> bentley
Cactus will have to be assigned to Target, and Frog will have to be given to the spammers. I'll ask Mashroom when Frog gets cleaned up.

2020-09-29T10:10:00 bentley -> van
Okay And cactus is now doing Paul and Derek

2020-09-29T10:10:06 bentley -> van
Don't give them away?

2020-09-29T10:10:46 van -> bentley
Don't give it away, see, my lowader seems to be dead, Target Cactus needs to give it away.

2020-09-29T10:11:09 bentley -> van

2020-09-29T10:11:15 van -> bentley

2020-09-29T10:11:19 bentley -> van

2020-09-29T10:11:27 bentley -> van

2020-09-29T12:18:02 bentley -> van
What about group 4? Shall we give it out today?

2020-09-29T12:18:50 van -> bentley
So Frog will not give out today, since the detects

2020-09-29T12:20:08 bentley -> van
Got it

2020-09-29T12:20:37 van -> bentley
Mashroom better not be touched. Should I ask for a cactus?

2020-09-29T12:20:44 bentley -> van
Come on.

2020-09-29T12:20:54 van -> bentley
I'll text him now.

2020-09-29T12:21:00 bentley -> van

2020-09-29T12:21:16 van -> bentley
group 4 ?

2020-09-29T12:21:25 bentley -> van
yes

2020-09-29T12:39:29 van -> bentley
Cactus collects, 4 group opened for him

2020-09-29T12:40:14 bentley -> van
Okay

2020-09-29T13:00:58 van -> bentley

2020-09-30T06:48:17 van -> bentley
Hi. Target has written a lot about our shit.

2020-09-30T06:48:33 van -> bentley
Requires testing.

2020-09-30T06:48:39 bentley -> van

Tell me the technology where it knocks and if you can check the performance of the gaskets

2020-09-30T06:49:24 bentley -> van
For example loader knocked there then went there.

2020-09-30T06:49:36 bentley -> van
How does the lowader connect to the admin panel

2020-09-30T06:49:47 bentley -> van
About the testing. We've been testing all day.

2020-09-30T06:49:48 van -> bentley
I check the gaskets before assembly, by the way

2020-09-30T06:50:05 van -> bentley
Yes I know everyone is doing the right thing.

2020-09-30T06:51:10 bentley -> van
I know. And Green also monitor them somewhere else the hitch. Because the detects are gone at startup but no bounce somewhere inside the failure and I want to understand the sequence of work and if there is a way to check the performance at different stages

2020-09-30T06:51:11 van -> bentley
the lauder makes a request to load the backdoor and that's it, the address in the request is the padding, the path in the request is the path seen in the group

2020-09-30T06:51:56 bentley -> van
Is there no more emercoin dns?

2020-09-30T06:52:03 van -> bentley
I have some issues to discuss with Booza right now

2020-09-30T06:52:17 bentley -> van
Come on, let's get a working solution out today.

2020-09-30T06:52:28 van -> bentley
coming soon

2020-09-30T06:53:31 van -> bentley
Green gave out new gaskets. What should we build? How about like before - one lowader with 6 pads, but 5 build options for crypto?

2020-09-30T06:54:46 bentley -> van
we can do several solutions: 1 loader 6 pads a couple of assemblies and 2-3 loaders with unic pads

2020-09-30T06:56:12 van -> bentley
Ok, we wait for Buza, we consult and I will assemble

2020-09-30T06:56:14 bentley -> van
and I also need to know what loeder is knocking on what ipi to check promptly at issuance

2020-09-30T06:56:24 van -> bentley
okay

2020-09-30T06:57:02 van -> bentley
let me check yesterday's pads for interest

2020-09-30T06:57:08 bentley -> van
come on

2020-09-30T06:57:28 bentley -> van
They should also be checked from US addresses. We can do that.

2020-09-30T06:57:38 bentley -> van
Tell me, how do you check?

2020-09-30T06:58:06 van -> bentley
Yes I have a console program, I type in the address and see the answer

2020-09-30T06:58:11 van -> bentley
I can send

2020-09-30T06:58:15 bentley -> van
come on

2020-09-30T06:58:23 bentley -> van
I will run on the US hard drive

2020-09-30T06:58:59 bentley -> van
Because Target uses Boer with certain routes that they keep changing

2020-09-30T06:59:21 bentley -> van
We have a solution just as good and especially not available to everyone.

2020-09-30T06:59:33 van -> bentley
got it

2020-09-30T07:00:50 van -> bentley
yesterday's lauder pads are all good at the moment

2020-09-30T07:00:57 van -> bentley
6 pieces

2020-09-30T07:01:17 van -> bentley

2020-09-30T07:31:52 van -> bentley
Different programs for loader and backdoor.
Run it, copy ip address after the cursor and enter.
In answer, in the headers you should see the field
Set-Cookie: SID= long value
this is the signature. If it is not there, you have to tell Buse, and it will generate it
and at the end of the output should be
Correct signature
This means that the pad is good, the signature is good too, so I've got the right one.

Where does BC get the address from?

2020-09-30T07:34:43 bentley -> van
The loader knocked on a specific IP in the admin panel. What's next?

2020-09-30T07:35:06 van -> bentley
what's the address? There is no download, no startup of the bk. Only a gasket check.

2020-09-30T07:35:14 bentley -> van
Admin replied he downloaded and ran beckdor right?

2020-09-30T07:35:20 van -> bentley
no

2020-09-30T07:35:48 van -> bentley
it's a test of the gasket to make sure it's going where it's supposed to go and isn't dead

2020-09-30T07:36:22 bentley -> van
I got it.

2020-09-30T07:36:37 bentley -> van
I mean the mechanism itself

2020-09-30T07:37:02 van -> bentley
about the mechanism later, I was overpowered by Target and Boosa came

2020-09-30T07:37:05 bentley -> van
I need to understand the algorithm and understand where and at what stages there may be a jam

Sorry for the pressure. Serious circumstances.

2020-09-30T07:37:55 van -> bentley
Why are you apologizing? )))

2020-09-30T07:38:15 bentley -> van
Yep

2020-09-30T07:38:42 van -> bentley
I'm the one promising you - I don't. I need to apologize.

2020-09-30T07:42:16 van -> bentley
Buza explained everything he wrote to you to me.

2020-09-30T07:46:54 van -> bentley
I'm building a loader with 6 pads, 5 options for crypto. That's all I can do for now. No domains yet. I'm going to be doing some redesigns for the domains. I should give Target Cactus and Mashroom. Since my Lowder's out.

2020-09-30T07:47:11 van -> bentley
How did the Mashroom Lowader work yesterday?

2020-09-30T07:48:25 bentley -> van
Deployment is not here yet.

2020-09-30T07:48:43 bentley -> van
Do you mean the domains with ssl?

in terms of

yes

2020-09-30T08:07:31 van -> bentley
Mashroom doesn't even know if his bk worked yesterday or not... I wish I lived like this...

2020-09-30T08:07:46 bentley -> van
I don't know either.

2020-09-30T08:07:50 bentley -> van
Deploy makes files

2020-09-30T08:08:31 van -> bentley
I know mine worked )))

2020-09-30T08:08:57 bentley -> van
What group will the Cactus loider have?

2020-09-30T08:09:11 bentley -> van
Mashroom - 2 it's understandable

2020-09-30T08:09:39 bentley -> van
When will he collect for the test? Cactus

2020-09-30T08:17:28 van -> bentley
Is mashroom picking up for today?

2020-09-30T08:17:43 bentley -> van
Yes, I asked.

2020-09-30T08:18:45 van -> bentley
You'd have to ask Target about the group. There's an empty one there, we can use it.

2020-09-30T08:19:01 van -> bentley
Tell Cactus?

Listen, I've changed something in the looder, in the organization of the queries. I'll send it to you right now. Try to test it too.

2020-09-30T08:55:12 bentley -> van
okay

2020-09-30T08:55:22 van -> bentley
It's just a "gotta do something" thing.

2020-09-30T08:55:32 van -> bentley
What if it's better...

2020-09-30T19:47:52 bentley -> van
Shall we make it to 10 bk with the new ssl gaskets?

Green is also waiting for something.

2020-10-01T06:45:26 van -> bentley
Didn't yell Target yesterday?

2020-10-01T06:46:14 van -> bentley
You asked for an assembly by 10-00, while I'm waiting...

2020-10-01T06:47:19 bentley -> van
No he's not.

2020-10-01T06:47:37 van -> bentley
ugh

2020-10-01T06:58:19 bentley -> van
Build on 1 new one for now, and as soon as the green one gives out, make an assembly with all the new ones.

2020-10-01T06:58:26 bentley -> van
want to work in the morning

2020-10-01T06:58:43 van -> bentley
I don't have a new one.

Ask Green, I think he had one.

2020-10-01T07:02:09 van -> bentley
he has one address, he will set it up now on the loeder. I will build the loeder with one new address, same as yesterday.
And the backdoor from yesterday stays... So only

2020-10-01T07:06:55 van -> bentley
How many loader variants do you want to assemble? Is one enough?

2020-10-01T07:13:26 van -> bentley
au!!!

2020-10-01T07:18:30 van -> bentley
The address in glory76.com:443
You can check it the same way with my gasket checker.
You type in glory76.com:443 (or glory76.com) and you can see if the address works or not.

2020-10-01T07:36:57 bentley -> van
I wrote him that every day you need 3 unic ssl pads to 10

2020-10-01T07:37:36 van -> bentley
Says it will give out later, and then it will be on stream. We'll have to be patient for now.

2020-10-01T07:37:53 bentley -> van
yes from 1 we will start working on europe and hopefully the u.s. will give out

2020-10-01T11:13:45 van -> bentley
I don't see your test knockouts for some reason. What group are they knocking in?

2020-10-01T11:14:36 van -> bentley
And when 2016 was detected, was there a knockback as well?

2020-10-01T11:15:07 bentley -> van

Yep

2020-10-01T11:17:12 van -> bentley
I don't see any bounce at all for some reason.

2020-10-01T11:17:24 van -> bentley
what group?

one1

2020-10-01T11:18:32 van -> bentley
testbots ?

2020-10-01T11:19:08 van -> bentley
maybe they don't knock one1, but some other way?

2020-10-01T11:19:18 bentley -> van
no they are not knocking yet apparently

2020-10-01T11:19:21 bentley -> van
I'll check it out.

2020-10-01T11:19:37 van -> bentley

[02.10.2020 19:47:29] <bentley> Bottom line. Van doesn't knock and Mashrum and katus didn't even take the job.
[02.10.2020 20:09:28] <buza> clearly
[02.10.2020 20:17:12] <buza> is it already with new domains?
[02.10.2020 20:17:30] <bentley> Yes
[02.10.2020 20:17:59] <bentley> Looks like Target needs to write a whole new BC since it's not working for us and Buer is knocking

[02.10.2020 20:54:41] <buza> and how did you find it?
[02.10.2020 20:54:55] <bentley> I searched by the certificate firm
[02.10.2020 20:55:10] <buza> but the certificate is the same for them
[02.10.2020 20:55:27] <bentley> It doesn't stain, it means
[02.10.2020 20:55:57] <bentley> or it's different
[02.10.2020 20:56:00] <buza> according to the targeting, it sticks more
[02.10.2020 20:59:20] <bentley> it seems we are much more dangerous and there is a big trail behind us, so they cut us down right away
[02.10.2020 20:59:36] <buza> any idea why so
[02.10.2020 20:59:45] <buza> just can not believe that technology reached such progress)
[02.10.2020 20:59:49] <buza> I mean, why do they cut us down?
[02.10.2020 21:00:08] <bentley> Why?
[02.10.2020 21:00:16] <buza> some signatures in the protocol
[02.10.2020 21:00:23] <buza> by uri
[02.10.2020 21:01:08] <bentley> Can we fix it?
[02.10.2020 21:01:34] <buza> we always have /api/vtotom in uri
[02.10.2020 21:01:42] <buza> if only that, yes
[02.10.2020 21:01:44] <buza> and even easy
[02.10.2020 21:01:58] <buza> and even in principle today if at mashroom with cactus
[02.10.2020 21:02:07] <bentley> ah about the address where the download is coming from
[02.10.2020 21:02:20] <bentley> you can do 1 test build
[02.10.2020 21:02:33] <buza> well the url looks like this
https://11.22.33.44/api/version
[02.10.2020 21:02:57] <bentley> api version
[02.10.2020 21:03:11] <buza> I guess the firewalls might catch this url - we've been in operation for a long time, it hasn't been changed from the start, i.e. read six months

[02.10.2020 21:03:18] <buza> and it could have already hit all the bases
[02.10.2020 21:03:25] <bentley> yes
[02.10.2020 21:03:30] <buza> but to do that, you need to spin up the ssl traffic
[02.10.2020 21:03:42] <buza> and it's not a trivial task even for DPI-devices
[02.10.2020 21:04:10] <bentley> I guess resources allow
[02.10.2020 21:04:55] <buza> command mashroom with cactus
[02.10.2020 21:05:11] <buza> go into their groups and change prefixes to something random but short
[02.10.2020 21:05:21] <bentley> yeah
[02.10.2020 21:05:26] <buza> change them every day
[02.10.2020 21:05:35] <buza> try to sell it to target
[02.10.2020 21:05:44] <bentley> Ok
[02.10.2020 21:06:37] <bentley> so there will be no /api/version right?
[02.10.2020 21:06:42] <buza> no
[02.10.2020 21:06:46] <buza> these strings should be gotten rid of
[02.10.2020 21:06:54] <buza> but they don't really affect anything, they were chosen for masking
[02.10.2020 21:25:00] <buza> okay, everything goes to the next week
[02.10.2020 21:25:06] <buza> it's not that easy to change that prefix there
[02.10.2020 21:25:30] <buza> more precisely, they need to figure out how not to lose compatibility with old bots with the old prefix
[02.10.2020 21:25:32] <buza> but I've already made it up)
[02.10.2020 21:26:22] <bentley> Great!

[02.10.2020 21:27:02] <buza> hz
[02.10.2020 21:27:49] <buza> well, after contacting Boer, it turns out that his software is much weaker in terms of protection against AV - he doesn't use any of our many techniques, which showed effectiveness against AV
[02.10.2020 21:27:58] <buza> and he doesn't have a hidden load trigger

[02.10.2020 21:28:34] <buza> but it has a triple layer traffic encryption and no prefixes
[02.10.2020 21:28:44] <buza> so it bypasses firewalls

[02.10.2020 20:09:28] <buza> clearly
[02.10.2020 20:17:12] <buza> is it already with new domains?

Can you send me that text of correspondence with Booza again? I have it in my history in another MS.

2020-10-05T06:15:24 bentley -> van
Because Target didn't want to get involved with BK anymore and worked with Boer

2020-10-05T06:16:25 van -> bentley
Have you tried mine? You should have tried other ones.
If you mean modifications with paths, like /api/, then it should be changed in the admin panel.

2020-10-05T06:20:21 bentley -> van
Yes

2020-10-05T06:20:26 bentley -> van
Buzu is waiting.

2020-10-05T06:21:03 van -> bentley
yes

2020-10-05T06:21:55 bentley -> van
and on encryption should be done as well. Buza said that there will be a different protocol of interaction with the admin panel.

2020-10-05T06:22:13 van -> bentley
uh-huh

2020-10-05T06:22:59 bentley -> van
Target also asked today to make simple loaders with chor encryption. He had Cactus and Mashroom do it last year.

2020-10-05T06:23:34 bentley -> van
There loadnr took an encrypted file from the link, unzipped it and ran it.

2020-10-05T06:24:10 van -> bentley
Yes, that's how we work. How do you have to do it?

2020-10-05T06:24:45 bentley -> van
That's right.

2020-10-05T06:25:30 bentley -> van
Just the last time I encrypted a file with the symbol I posted on the link and sent the link with the encryption symbol to Cactus and Mashroom.

2020-10-05T06:26:34 van -> bentley
i.e. uploading backdoor not from admin?

2020-10-05T06:27:16 bentley -> van
Yes there was another eche yet not a backdoor. Trick. And now Target wants to work with some other exe but for us to make a loader for it

2020-10-05T06:27:22 bentley -> van
In this format

2020-10-05T06:27:33 van -> bentley
got it

2020-10-05T06:28:07 van -> bentley
Tell Cactus and Mashroom?

2020-10-05T06:28:14 bentley -> van
Yes.

2020-10-05T06:28:24 van -> bentley
Cactus didn't work last year, by the way.

2020-10-05T06:28:34 bentley -> van
So in the beginning of this was

2020-10-05T06:29:00 van -> bentley
ok, let's do it

2020-10-05T06:29:28 bentley -> van
great!

2020-10-05T07:16:44 van -> bentley
Cactus started collecting, yes, he did it last year, you're right )))

2020-10-05T07:17:08 bentley -> van
He needs a link and a key

2020-10-05T07:17:16 van -> bentley
yes, of course

2020-10-05T07:17:17 bentley -> van
As soon as I get one, I'll send it to you.

2020-10-05T07:17:26 van -> bentley
Yeah, thanks

2020-10-06T15:10:57 van -> bentley
Here's the thing, I'll be gone for the rest of the week.
Write me what you need tomorrow morning, I'll build it.
I'll pass my loader backdoor to GHOST (ghost@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion) to maintain and build daily.
He will build it, clean it up. I'm writing him instructions now.

2020-10-06T15:12:19 bentley -> van
Yes he texted me back. Take a break for sure.

There were 77 bots knocking away in group 14 yesterday. Target is stomping its feet. Is that a bad thing at all?

2020-10-14T08:05:44 bentley -> van
Did a good job yesterday with the Mashroom bot. Yours didn't knock well. They started with it but then switched to Mashroom

2020-10-14T08:06:23 bentley -> van
His bot was practically never in the works. Before that, everything was done only by yours.

"mash" in the first column is likely referring to "car", so they have a dozen C2 boxes. "HZ" is "HZ" meaning they're not sure, check after break. "na 2 kruge" = on second pass. "na glaz" = approximately.

Hi!
I got a Win10-64-bentley machine from you. Can I still work on it?
What yesterday?

2020-10-16T07:43:29 bentley -> van
Hi.

2020-10-16T07:43:45 bentley -> van
Did a great job yesterday with Mashroom, yours almost didn't knock and neither did Cactus.

2020-10-16T08:00:18 van -> bentley
Tell me, on the dincheck, what were the differences between Mashroom and me?

Hi! Target asked for mine and Mashroom's build early. And me, Gohost, Cactus can't get to the admins with loaders. There are updates in the admin. Green was stressing with the pads, but it doesn't seem to be about the pads.

2020-10-19T07:01:05 bentley -> van
Got it

2020-10-19T09:16:52 van -> bentley
