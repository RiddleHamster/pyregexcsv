[21.02.22 14:20:46] elliott: I didn't understand where the kid came from, they wrote about the rb
[21.02.22 14:20:55] alexis: well, the testers are obviously falling down
[21.02.22 14:20:58] elliott: as i understood from stern and one hof was described
[21.02.22 14:21:09] elliott: but it's written that like at least two of the rb
[21.02.22 14:21:31] elliott: if you're not too lazy you can go back and find
[21.02.22 14:21:34] elliott: before they shut it down
[21.02.22 14:21:52] alexis: how long ago did you write?
[21.02.22 14:21:54] elliott: that's when toad was urgently changed to rocket
[21.02.22 14:22:07] alexis: so everything is already rubbed off
[21.02.22 14:22:09] elliott: he really panicked not for nothing, they really hacked and got the correspondence
