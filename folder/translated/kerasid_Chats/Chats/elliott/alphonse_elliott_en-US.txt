[27.07.21 09:19:07] elliott: what i don't know
[27.07.21 09:19:23] elliott: otherwise they will ask for something until you find it, I've been there already)

[30.07.21 10:07:55] elliott: Oh, I got it.
[30.07.21 10:14:16] elliott: what else do I need to know?
[30.07.21 10:14:56] elliott: By the way, my admin area is completely empty
[30.07.21 10:15:10] elliott: maybe there is some dump to at least see all this shit, it doesn't work?
[30.07.21 10:15:40] elliott: well, where from
[30.07.21 10:20:53] elliott: is there a command for that? I've never been able to dump
[30.07.21 10:23:15] elliott: Permission denied

[30.07.21 10:30:42] elliott: how do you get it back now?
[30.07.21 10:38:05] elliott: torify scp root@185.25.49.159:/var/www/html/advanced-project/db.sql /home/
[30.07.21 10:38:06] elliott: it's easier that way, it doesn't connect through ms
[30.07.21 10:41:44] elliott: how do you roll it up in your house now?
[30.07.21 10:44:15] elliott: yeah, I already found it
[30.07.21 10:48:32] elliott: Out.
[30.07.21 10:48:37] elliott: a long time ago
[30.07.21 21 21:50:47] elliott: let's wait.
[30.07.21 21:50:51] elliott: all in the git?
[30.07.21 21:52:23] elliott: what's the admin password?
[30.07.21 21:52:59] elliott: well, wherever, I pulled the base from the new one, and the password is all, no way
[09.08.21 10:35:56] elliott: ps.

[09.08.21 13:08:45] alphonse: i'll digest it today - i'll send you the task and i'll explain
[09.08.21 13:09:17] alphonse: look at p3 for now. it's easy. besides, i may have made it

[10.08.21 09:03:43] elliott: do you want a pass to the admin area or to the ssh?

[10.08.21 09:47:29] alphonse: it does.
[11.08.21 11:48:53] alphonse: koo
[11.08.21 11:48:59] alphonse: p3 I did
[11.08.21 11:49:43] alphonse: you like to break?)
[11.08.21 13:13:07] elliott: it depends
[11.08.21 13:25:41] alphonse: p4
[11.08.21 14:07:06] elliott: well, that's easy
[11.08.21 14:08:23] alphonse: break it
[12.08.21 07:01:05] alphonse: koo
[12.08.21 07:01:11] alphonse: broke it?
[12.08.21 07:08:40] alphonse: ew
[12.08.21 08:46:26] elliott: me
[12.08.21 08:48:23] alphonse: what about p4?
[12.08.21 08:48:28] alphonse: broke?
[12.08.21 08:48:51] elliott: wait, I was busy yesterday, now
[12.08.21 08:50:06] alphonse: well, come to think of it, can you break it by monday, along with editing migrations?
[12.08.21 08:50:22] elliott: you don't have to be smart to break it, but what is migration editing?
[12.08.21 08:51:34] alphonse: everything staged and related database fields will be eliminated
[12.08.21 08:51:58] elliott: you need some intelligence.
[12.08.21 08:52:17] alphonse: p11?
[12.08.21 08:52:27] alphonse: 11. Improvements in the group card
11.1 You should have access to keys for all prefixes - i.e. it should be possible to download / copy them to clipboard.
By pressing the "Set to production" button opposite the prefix, all data of this prefix (prefix, version, keys) should be placed in the corresponding fields of the "Production Files" area.

11.2 It should be possible to delete prefixes in groups:
- Add a column with a checkbox in the prefixes registry. Add "Delete selected" button, which will delete all selected prefixes (with preliminary confirmation of deletion).
- Add a "Delete all prefixes" button to delete all prefixes of the group (with a prior confirmation of deletion).

11.3 Next to the area "Fake Cookies" add a field "Last updated". , in which to display the date and time of the last change in the area "Fake Cookies".
[12.08.21 08:53:02]
[12.08.21 08:53:28] alphonse: i thought you already did clause 11.1.
[12.08.21 08:54:30] elliott: yes, but now I see, it doesn't work
[12.08.21 08:54:48] alphonse: I didn't change anything there
[12.08.21 08:55:41] elliott: unbranded. Key access. Somewhere you need to add a button to download the key files. I think somewhere in the panels next to the keys.
[12.08.21 08:55:59] elliott: Set to production just fills in the fields
[12.08.21 08:56:23] elliott: in the column with files make a checkbox and kill all or what is marked
[12.08.21 08:56:35] elliott: right? so I don't have to fuck with clicking on the cart
[12.08.21 08:56:50] alphonse: similar to bots
[12.08.21 08:58:11] alphonse: I need to add a button somewhere that will download the key files. - why? it's not a big key.
[12.08.21 08:58:32] elliott: :rofl:
[12.08.21 09:13:21] elliott: I don't get it
[12.08.21 09:13:52] elliott: in group migration, there aren't even fields for keys
[12.08.21 09:14:29] alphonse: and fields for keys in file table:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
[12.08.21 09:14:47] elliott: 'crypt' => $this->text(),
            'crypt2' => $this->text(),
[12.08.21 09:14:49] elliott: only two
[12.08.21 09:14:52] elliott: 4 keys
[12.08.21 09:15:13] elliott: But that's right, two keys per file
[12.08.21 09:15:38] elliott: just in the group controller
[12.08.21 09:15:42] elliott: $group->crypt3 = $f->crypt;
                $group->crypt23 = $f->crypt2;
[12.08.21 09:15:56] elliott: where does it save these keys if there are no fields there?
[12.08.21 09:16:49] alphonse: this is some kind of rudiment
[12.08.21 09:17:04] alphonse: previously keys were in groups
[12.08.21 09:17:27] elliott: delete it
[12.08.21 09:18:03] alphonse: just make a copy)
[12.08.21 09:18:22] elliott: Got it
[12.08.21 09:18:23] alphonse: or you'll crumple it up
[13.08.21 08:49:15] elliott: are you having fun with the country bug?
[13.08.21 08:51:15] alphonse: yes
[13.08.21 09:02:59] alphonse: you keep having fun with p4 and p11
[13.08.21 09:06:24] elliott: in progress
[13.08.21 09:06:38] elliott: i think there's no field with modification date for cookies
[13.08.21 09:06:53] elliott: only creations. does it make sense to implement it?
[13.08.21 09:12:26]
[13.08.21 09:12:26] alphonse: only what you wrote
[13.08.21 09:12:47] elliott: well, they wrote the field with the modification time
[13.08.21 09:12:49] elliott: It's missing
[13.08.21 09:14:23]
[13.08.21 09:14:27] alphonse: p4
[13.08.21 09:14:51] alphonse: so the bugs don't get out
[13.08.21 09:14:53] elliott: in builder commands - commands "update bot XX" and "update loader XX".
[13.08.21 09:14:57]
[13.08.21 09:15:03] alphonse: I broke that
[13.08.21 09:15:27] elliott: well, then I kind of cleaned up the stage, but I didn't make the migration to remove the fields
[13.08.21 09:15:41] elliott: I can upload a branch to look at
[13.08.21 09:17:39] elliott: p11 branch
[13.08.21 09:17:52] alphonse: okay.
[13.08.21 09:17:55] alphonse: then that's it.
[13.08.21 09:18:03] alphonse: I have p7
[13.08.21 09:18:12] elliott: removed the stages, made the set button that extended and added the cookie creation date
[13.08.21 09:18:29] elliott: and filled it up. waiting for your feedback
[13.08.21 09:56:54] alphonse: i have to bounce for 3 hours. it's my mom's birthday))) if the cry about the filter goes up - in line 240-250 hardcoded crutch. do something)))
[13.08.21 09:59:33]
[13.08.21 10:36:48] elliott: run
[13.08.21 17:02:13] elliott: everything, p11 poured, added file removal by analogy with bots
[13.08.21 17:05:21] elliott: two commits, the last one was named normally, and the previous one had blunted the name and that's why it's called about the clock in the hider)
[13.08.21 21:15:31] elliott: what's wrong there? panic on the ship
[13.08.21 21:19:09] alphonse: filters all... I needed group to open all countries, but it wasn't allowed) i could list all 250+ countries in white rule, but they didn't want to. i started to change filter code - broke everything)
[13.08.21 21:34:45]
[08/13/2018 21:34:50] alphonse: sorting
[08/13/2018 21:35:05] alphonse: forgot NULL by default at the end
[08/13/2018 21:35:10] alphonse: everything
[13.08.21 21:35:12] alphonse: it works
[16.08.21 12:04:30] elliott: ps
[16.08.21 12:04:30] elliott: did you pick up the branch?
[16.08.21 14:37:53] elliott: ps.

[16.08.21 14:40:18] alphonse: wrote what?
[16.08.21 14:48:56] elliott: did you pick up the branch?

[16.08.21 14:52:30] alphonse: I have enough entertainment
[16.08.21 14:56:41] elliott: i thought you fixed it in pt
[16.08.21 15:08:00] alphonse: so there's a lot
[24.08.21 12:39:57] elliott: you got the rest?
[24.08.21 12:45:17] alphonse: in progress
[25.08.21 06:15:25] alphonse: koo!
[25.08.21 06:15:40] alphonse: will you take p8?
[25.08.21 06:16:12] alphonse: there's another API with authorization only
[25.08.21 07:56:17] elliott: let me check it out
[25.08.21 07:57:42] elliott: I need api for automatic filling group card (by HTTP-request) - prefixes (and files for them), keys, cookies names.
(IN DEVELOPMENT).
[25.08.21 07:57:48] elliott: are there any explanations?
[25.08.21 08:48:55]
[25.08.21 08:49:32] alphonse: make one more API and add authorization to it
[25.08.21 08:49:38] alphonse: authorization by Admin database
[25.08.21 08:50:13] alphonse: I guess you should make a copy of api and put it on a separate port
[25.08.21 08:50:41] alphonse: then drag and drop everything about authorization from backend
[25.08.21 08:58:37] alphonse: ew
[25.08.21 08:58:57] alphonse: let's go step by step
make another API and add authorization to it
authorization by Admin database
i suggest you make a copy of the api and put it on a separate port
and then drag the authorization part from the backend
8:58 AM
[25.08.21 08:59:47] alphonse: you can use backdoor api and add authorization
[25.08.21 09:00:50] alphonse: no
[25.08.21 09:00:54] alphonse: you can't
[25.08.21 09:01:00] alphonse: silver won't let
[25.08.21 09:01:07] alphonse: make a new one
[25.08.21 10:12:21] elliott: I don't quite understand what do you mean, make a new api?
[25.08.21 11:11:06] alphonse: literally))
[25.08.21 11:11:24] alphonse: making another api type application
[25.08.21 11:12:18] alphonse: it copies the same api under a different name
[25.08.21 11:12:35] alphonse: and set port in newinks
[25.08.21 15:37:26] elliott: did you pick up p11 branch?
[25.08.21 15:40:16] elliott: apihttp added, will be in the same branch
[25.08.21 15:40:33] elliott: or do you have a better name?
[25.08.21 17:41:35] alphonse: there are thoughts of dying and doing everything in one proto2-gate
[26.08.21 14:42:18] elliott: all groups are gone, should that be it?
[26.08.21 15:08:58] elliott: P
[26.08.21 15:08:58] elliott: ps.
[26.08.21 15:09:25] elliott: a couple of questions. Apihttp add a dick, sending a post request to it with parameters to fill out a group isn't much of a problem either. Some kind of authorization will be there.
[26.08.21 15:09:26] elliott: ?
[26.08.21 15:11:11] alphonse: not something, but similar backend using table Admin
[26.08.21 15:13:32] elliott: just by login and password?
[26.08.21 15:13:44] elliott: or by plugin scheme with fucking hitters?
[26.08.21 15:13:59] elliott: in the plugin, by the way, I looked, you removed all these checks
[26.08.21 15:14:23] alphonse: the plugin doesn't need them. there's no authorization
[26.08.21 15:14:42] alphonse: it won't be any trickier
[26.08.21 20:30:20] elliott: I don't get it anyway. the plugin had friend-or-foe recognition
[26.08.21 20:30:31] elliott: how should it be done in the new api for groups?
[26.08.21 20:30:42] elliott: or it is not needed there at all?
[26.08.21 20:31:30] alphonse: plugin serves bot protocol
[26.08.21 20:31:47] alphonse: this api will serve coders' requests
[26.08.21 20:32:00] alphonse: login/pass
[26.08.21 20:32:18] elliott: I see, I don't understand the requirements for it, except for sending a couple of parameters. Among those parameters will be login and pass, and that's it, right?
[26.08.21 20:32:32] alphonse: yes
[26.08.21 20:32:41] elliott: perfect standard admin login as it is
[26.08.21 20:34:02] alphonse: yes, but just pay attention to backend/components/rbac
[26.08.21 20:35:30] elliott: there are three roles, but they don't match the roles in the admin area
[26.08.21 20:36:57] elliott: or did you just mean something like this if (Yii::$app->user->isGuest) {
            return $this->goHome();
        }
        if(!(Yii::$app->user->identity->role == Admin::ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN || Yii::$app->user->identity->role == Admin::ROLE_MANAGER)){
            return $this->goHome();
        }
[26.08.21 20:36:59]
[26.08.21 20:37:57] elliott: you probably shouldn't put this shit into every method, you should check this on controller input
[26.08.21 20:38:43] elliott: what the hell do they call it in the lab...
[26.08.21 20:40:18] elliott: middletown, shit
[26.08.21 20:40:27] elliott: middleware
[26.08.21 20:43:58] alphonse: it seems to be in behaviors() here.
[27.08.21 11:01:46] alphonse: koo
[27.08.21 11:01:50] alphonse: koo
[27.08.21 11:01:59] alphonse: what's up?
[27.08.21 12:03:29] elliott: okay, api done, no logic yet
[27.08.21 12:03:37] elliott: fuck you with other things
[27.08.21 12:03:48] elliott: but i think i'll do it by next week, or is it urgent?
[27.08.21 12:04:24] elliott: It's supposed to be by September 1
[27.08.21 12:06:44] alphonse: Relax, we won't have time)))
[27.08.21 12:07:03] alphonse: you need to wait for Kolyan to clarify some things
[27.08.21 12:07:30] alphonse: fill in api
[27.08.21 12:07:34] alphonse: into the main
[27.08.21 12:07:38] alphonse: I want to see
[27.08.21 12:07:46] elliott: empty folder?)
[27.08.21 12:07:55] alphonse: yeah
[27.08.21 12:07:59] elliott: I already started it in p11
[27.08.21 12:08:08] alphonse: and also the groups you've been working on
[27.08.21 12:08:13] elliott: you should have a new branch of course
[27.08.21 12:08:19] alphonse: Nah
[27.08.21 12:08:44] alphonse: exactly the api won't affect functionality of what you have
[27.08.21 12:08:55] alphonse: I want to see
[27.08.21 12:10:47] elliott: does not allow to push
[27.08.21 12:11:03] elliott: fuck, it already happened, how did I fight it...?
[27.08.21 12:11:11] alphonse: do pool
[27.08.21 12:11:22] alphonse: i've done a shitload there
[27.08.21 12:11:46] elliott: no. it would have said pool
[27.08.21 12:11:50] elliott: and there's just a rejacket
[27.08.21 12:12:22] elliott: fatal: It seems that there is already a rebase-merge directory, and
I wonder if you are in the middle of another rebase.  If that is the
case, please try
	git rebase (--continue | --abort | --skip)
If that is not the case, please
	rm -fr ".git/rebase-merge"
and run me again.  I am stopping in case you still have something
valuable there.
[27.08.21 12:13:49] elliott: no, this is fucked up again.
[27.08.21 12:13:56] elliott: I got the whole project in loose files
[27.08.21 12:14:40] elliott: and the groups went fucked up
[27.08.21 12:14:56]
[27.08.21 12:15:03] elliott: no
[27.08.21 12:15:29] alphonse: what the fuck? don't you feel sorry for your work?) you know that git is fucked
[27.08.21 12:22:40] elliott: Fuck!
[27.08.21 12:22:40] elliott: i don't know what to do now
[27.08.21 12:22:43] elliott: no bullets, no flushes
[27.08.21 12:23:34] alphonse: did you find the code?
[27.08.21 12:23:46] elliott: there's a lot in the groups
[27.08.21 12:23:49] elliott: try to find it
[27.08.21 12:24:02]
[27.08.21 12:24:33] alphonse: i'm having fun too p9
[27.08.21 12:25:45] elliott: the git is dead
[27.08.21 12:25:50] elliott: everything short like we like
[27.08.21 12:27:53] alphonse: just comitted a piece of his work. all ok
[27.08.21 12:28:08] elliott: and fuckin' log in
[27.08.21 12:28:24] alphonse: do you console the git?
[27.08.21 12:28:30] elliott: yeah
[27.08.21 12:28:43] alphonse: monster
[27.08.21 12:28:47] elliott: i'm having some trouble with linux
[27.08.21 12:28:52] elliott: with gui
[27.08.21 12:29:30] alphonse: I've been using smartgit since 15. and it's the same version. never update
[27.08.21 12:30:01] alphonse: I can give you
[27.08.21 12:30:10] elliott: let's try
[27.08.21 12:30:14] alphonse: it's paid and works for a month
[27.08.21 12:30:34] alphonse: but this version just makes you wait a minute to start up and that's it
[27.08.21 12:32:34] elliott: something started
[27.08.21 12:32:38] elliott: but check for that and there

[27.08.21 12:34:18] elliott: storm on Ubuntu can't fucking display properly
[27.08.21 12:34:24] elliott: console is also a real pain
[27.08.21 12:34:25] alphonse: just put the fucking thing on and don't fuck around
[27.08.21 12:34:49] alphonse: i rejected storm. i'm still using sublimations
[27.08.21 12:35:02] elliott: ay no, i've been fed up with sublimations for 10 years
[27.08.21 12:35:14] elliott: storm used to suck on linux, now it's fine
[27.08.21 12:35:19] elliott: only things like git are unfinished
[27.08.21 12:36:13] elliott: does it run for like a minute without any signs? because i pressed it and nothing happens

[27.08.21 12:37:47] elliott: won't 11 work?

[30.08.21 09:54:33] alphonse: and also does not work
[30.08.21 09:54:57] alphonse: busy with other things - just say so.
[30.08.21 09:55:12] elliott: what do you mean?
[30.08.21 09:55:15] elliott: what exactly is not working?
[30.08.21 09:56:16] alphonse: i mean, i click below on the file - and it won't go to the right place. moreover, i can't even reset the current value
[30.08.21 09:57:34] alphonse: you said you like to break)
[30.08.21 09:57:41] alphonse: well, break it good
[30.08.21 09:57:43] elliott: maybe something went wrong, I press, it fills
[30.08.21 09:58:10] alphonse: fix the moment everything works
[30.08.21 09:58:15] alphonse: zip or rar
[30.08.21 09:58:25] alphonse: zip to main
[30.08.21 09:58:35] elliott: into the main which one?
[30.08.21 09:59:04] alphonse: well, it's been proto2-rate for almost a year now
[30.08.21 09:59:09] alphonse: *gate
[30.08.21 09:59:49] elliott: i think i'll double-check it, after the adventures with git, what's filled in there. about the design, i tried, but in fact i failed to make it better than it was
[30.08.21 10:00:36]
[30.08.21 10:00:55] alphonse: customers, like me, sometimes have two monitors side by side. or even three
[30.08.21 10:01:21] alphonse: and sometimes even a 12-inch point
[30.08.21 10:02:22] elliott: you tell me how to do it, or I'll come up with the wrong one
[30.08.21 10:02:30] elliott: What, so it pulls to the left?
[30.08.21 10:04:17] elliott: And another question about the buttons. What I have now is this. Four files in a group, each to its own field, right?
[30.08.21 10:04:41] elliott: Opposite to each file there is this button, fill in. And there's a number where to fill in, $model->destination
[30.08.21 10:04:50] elliott: This number is the same for all
[30.08.21 10:05:05] elliott: maybe that's why it looks like it's not working
[30.08.21 10:09:24] elliott: I load files one at a time into a group and everything is fine and the destination is different
[30.08.21 10:09:24] elliott: and there's a cross
[30.08.21 10:09:38] elliott: and the fields are filled by the button
[30.08.21 10:10:14] alphonse: all just have the same destinction. everyone uploads botx64
[30.08.21 10:11:33] elliott: well, for example, open any ready group with files. everyone has 13
[30.08.21 10:11:33] elliott: four files and all 13, how do you want it to fill? it fills bot64
[30.08.21 10:11:33] elliott: every time you click on anything
[30.08.21 10:13:52] elliott: It works
[30.08.21 10:39:31] elliott: Ow.
[30.08.21 10:40:00]
[30.08.21 12:02:19] alphonse: Watch this.
[30.08.21 12:02:22] alphonse: taking the band
[30.08.21 12:02:35] alphonse: there's no file
[30.08.21 12:02:47] alphonse: it has no name
[30.08.21 12:02:48] alphonse: not at all
[30.08.21 12:03:09] alphonse: it should be orange with a cross at the bottom
[30.08.21 12:03:15] alphonse: uploading a new one
[30.08.21 12:03:28] alphonse: press GO
[30.08.21 12:03:44] alphonse: new one appears with name and cross
[30.08.21 12:04:05] alphonse: add name and cross
[30.08.21 12:05:30] alphonse: that's some kind of shit with file name
[30.08.21 12:05:36] alphonse: but it works fine
[30.08.21 12:09:59] elliott: there's no problem, there's a condition if file is on disk
[30.08.21 12:21:15] elliott: if(Files::getIDByStoredfilename($model->b64_source) && file_exists(Yii::getAlias('@absPath').$model->b64_source)){
[30.08.21 12:26:35] elliott: since the condition looks reasonable, I didn't touch it
[30.08.21 12:36:47] alphonse: hehe
[30.08.21 12:37:01] alphonse: well, here's the thing: I enter the group
[30.08.21 12:37:14] alphonse: not
[30.08.21 12:37:17] alphonse: it's okay
[30.08.21 12:37:19] alphonse: ))
[30.08.21 12:37:49] alphonse: okay, I'll fix the layout
[30.08.21 18:06:21] elliott: if you know the secret to check your password, let me know. i can't do it
[30.08.21 18:13:31] elliott: It's also impossible to check the role
[30.08.21 18:13:43] elliott: this will have to be discussed separately, how to get a user without loading half the site and forms
[30.08.21 18:14:04] elliott: or use some other authorization method
[30.08.21 18:36:06] alphonse: ok. I'll deal with mine now.

[01.09.21 14:53:30] elliott: I thought you were talking about bands
[01.09.21 14:53:51] elliott: a couple of imports into the plugin, it's not a problem, that's what you do
[01.09.21 14:54:22] elliott: the idea was to give Vasya a framework to work in, that's what I did

[10.09.21 10:55:10] elliott: now I don't know, things have changed.
[10.09.21 10:55:23] alphonse: because they used to give me shit instead of a key and complained that they got 500

[15.09.21 19:27:54] elliott: there seems to be no files uploaded and admin is not set correctly, to put it from root - will be a problem with the rights

[15.09.21 19:29:50] elliott: rights are not okay there
[15.09.21 19:29:56] alphonse: so what? it worked before
[15.09.21 19:29:59] elliott: it wouldn't save the file to disk until I hand-tapped it
[15.09.21 19:30:17] elliott: I don't know what was there before, now I have no write access
[15.09.21 19:30:20]
[15.09.21 19:30:27] elliott: no write access yet
[15.09.21 19:30:49] elliott: this likes doesn't work next
[15.09.21 19:30:51] elliott: above
[15.09.21 19:31:26] elliott: it means that file is loaded on the disk, but not written into the database
[15.09.21 19:35:46] elliott: it's somewhere in the loop that saving backend/controllers/UploadtoolsController.php doesn't work
[15.09.21 19:40:13] elliott: it's weird though, everything returns true
[15.09.21 19:46:05] elliott: that's the answer
[15.09.21 19:46:07] elliott: empty model
[15.09.21 19:46:09] elliott: ["l86_source"]=> string(0) ""
[15.09.21 19:49:03] elliott: which means that the group with this id was not found
[15.09.21 19:49:48] elliott: Or it was found, but there is nothing in it at all, no values in the fields
[15.09.21 19:50:10] elliott: although saving file returned True, nothing was written anywhere
[15.09.21 19:54:42] elliott: I don't really understand how it ended up in the group, if it was written to a file, but locally it somehow worked
[15.09.21 19:54:46] elliott: But not on the server
[15.09.21 20:00:57] alphonse: I see
[15.09.21 20:01:12] alphonse: returning to server 65 what it was originally
[15.09.21 20:01:19] elliott: fuck it
[15.09.21 20:01:24] elliott: try transferring files
[15.09.21 20:02:27] elliott: none of them match the ones I have

[15.09.21 20:06:47] elliott: migration can't apply, says it's already there, but I just put it there
[15.09.21 20:16:00] elliott: why the fuck no migration?
[15.09.21 20:17:04] alphonse: duh
[15.09.21 20:18:50] elliott: Setting unknown property: common\models\Groups::updated_at
[15.09.21 20:18:57] elliott: that's fucked up
[15.09.21 20:19:41] elliott: any pchpadmin?
[15.09.21 20:22:37] alphonse: he used to work there
[15.09.21 20:22:46] elliott: found it
[15.09.21 20:22:56] elliott: now it works
[15.09.21 20:22:57] alphonse: it's on some port
[15.09.21 20:23:00] elliott: you have to upload all the files
[15.09.21 20:23:26] elliott: instead of trying to drag and drop one at a time
[15.09.21 20:23:40] elliott: i don't know what the fuck is wrong with migration, i added the field by hand
[15.09.21 20:23:55] elliott: https://217.12.204.65/sOIDFhsAIUfhu42332uygt27634ft7yuaFGyaugkJFsayjegf--_-GBASfdvt23fv/index.php?r=groups%2Floadertool&id=46
[15.09.21 20:26:12] alphonse: yeah. all ok
[16.09.21 08:00:36] alphonse: koo
[16.09.21 08:01:36] alphonse: go to redman and take care of your assigned task (from yesterday). if you think it's done, put it into testing
[16.09.21 08:02:25] alphonse: because redman has big bosses who fuck you over for missed tasks
[16.09.21 09:01:34] elliott: I can't close it
[16.09.21 09:01:37] elliott: transferred to testing
[17.09.21 08:01:52] elliott: Fuck!
[17.09.21 08:02:22] alphonse: fuck yeah
[17.09.21 08:02:43] elliott: when you put in a new prefix it doesn't show up in the "Files attached to group" list - maybe I don't understand what it wants?
[17.09.21 08:03:18] elliott: what does adding a new prefix mean?
[17.09.21 08:04:07] alphonse: so discuss with him in the group.
[17.09.21 08:04:23] elliott: well, first I want to talk to you so I don't look like an idiot in public
[17.09.21 08:07:23] alphonse: Ln said something about several prefixes being possible to put on one and the same file. the problem can be solved by multiple file uploads
[17.09.21 08:07:55] elliott: that's how multiple loading works
[17.09.21 08:08:06] alphonse: check if the window file already exists - keep - replace works correctly
[17.09.21 12:52:01] alphonse: ku
[17.09.21 12:53:07] alphonse: did I gave you in the package to deploy the admin. is file to replace? I fixed the bug in the plugin
[17.09.21 13:06:41] alphonse: ew
[17.09.21 13:09:50] elliott: he didn't
[17.09.21 13:10:31] elliott: it's supposed to be in the git
[17.09.21 13:10:54] alphonse: it shouldn't. it's in the vendor folder
[17.09.21 13:10:57] elliott: or it's the vendors
[17.09.21 13:12:06] alphonse: how he didn't? i asked you to try to make overriding, and if it fails - just replace the жс file in the package
[17.09.21 13:12:19] elliott: you should put it into the git somewhere so it would always be there
[17.09.21 13:12:24] elliott: neither gave nor asked for
[17.09.21 13:12:34] alphonse: so i fucking lost it)
[17.09.21 13:12:51] elliott: all i remember something about the menu seems to have been and there was no need to fix anything in the plugin
[17.09.21 13:12:51] alphonse: i remember exactly what i did.
[17.09.21 13:12:59] elliott: which bun?
[17.09.21 13:13:52] alphonse: johnitvn\ajaxcrud\BulkButtonWidget;
[17.09.21 13:14:44] alphonse: for example if you try to click go without choosing anything, a modal window will pop up that cannot be closed by close button
[17.09.21 13:15:25] elliott: i was fixing that
[17.09.21 13:15:30] elliott: there's a bar
[17.09.21 13:15:38] elliott: the colt was missing
[17.09.21 13:16:29]
[17.09.21 13:16:39] alphonse: as I remember changing something here
[17.09.21 13:16:40] alphonse: var instance = this;
        $(this.footer).append(buttonElm);
        if (callback !== null) {
            $(buttonElm).click(function (event) {
                callback.call(instance, this, event);
            });
        }
[17.09.21 13:16:40] elliott: let me see what's what
[17.09.21 13:17:13]
[17.09.21 13:17:21] elliott: I know
[17.09.21 13:18:28] alphonse: well, make this bug if you know it and make some way to remember it when deploying
[17.09.21 13:19:09] alphonse: otherwise you'll get a headache after each deployment
[18.09.21 09:47:36] alphonse: koo
[18.09.21 09:48:07] alphonse: ah that's who broke the layout in the command builder)
[18.09.21 09:50:14] alphonse: notice how file upload looks in command builder. when I fix it, it breaks file upload layout in groups.
[18.09.21 14:15:59] elliott: i didn't break anything)
[18.09.21 14:20:20] elliott: my uploads look fine and check for double, although we removed this check for groups. But I think it's normal.
[18.09.21 14:20:26] elliott: it was worse in groups
[18.09.21 15:47:43] alphonse: I fixed ss everywhere. don't touch it
[18.09.21 15:48:52] alphonse: what about the bun (clise button not working) ?
[20.09.21 08:53:13] elliott: nothing yet
[20.09.21 08:53:27] elliott: can't find where it's at, I remember it was easy last time, now nothing
[20.09.21 08:53:45] elliott: took everything new out of the git, I never touched the styles
[20.09.21 11:04:49] elliott: the problem is this plugin is used in many places
[20.09.21 11:05:00] elliott: and if you start changing anything in it, who the fuck knows where it'll pop out
[20.09.21 14:21:23] elliott: the problem is this plugin is used in so many places
and if you start to change something in it, you don't know where the fuck it'll pop out
[20.09.21 14:21:59] alphonse: what plugin do you mean?
[20.09.21 14:22:17] elliott: the one with the button on the bun
[20.09.21 14:22:28] elliott: johnitvn\ajaxcrud;
[20.09.21 14:22:41] alphonse: it's not going anywhere. The bun is the same everywhere.
[20.09.21 14:22:44] elliott: it's used automatically in so many fucking places
[20.09.21 14:23:02] elliott: and used incorrectly, if you were paying attention, it has mixed parameters
[20.09.21 14:23:20] alphonse: yeah, that's it.
[20.09.21 14:23:35] elliott: <button type="btn btn-default" class="function (button, event) {
                this.hide();
            }">Close</button>.
[20.09.21 14:23:45] elliott: fucked up class, onclick and tap
[20.09.21 14:24:11] elliott: so I'm not sure that if I get into it, it won't float elsewhere, because it's not really a bug in this function
[20.09.21 14:24:16] elliott: the bug is where you call it
[20.09.21 14:24:22] alphonse: I gave you a code fragment where you just need to check: whether there is a parameter or not
[20.09.21 14:24:41] elliott: probably ate the chat
[20.09.21 14:24:54] elliott: ``
this.addFooterButton = function (label, type, classes, callback) {
        buttonElm = document.createElement('button');
        buttonElm.setAttribute('type', type === null ? 'button' : type);
        buttonElm.setAttribute('class', classes === null ? 'btn btn-primary' : classes);

[20.09.21 14:24:58] elliott: this piece right here?

[20.09.21 16:41:28] alphonse: it
[21.09.21 14:24:56] elliott: what's up?
[21.09.21 14:25:06] elliott: no commits for a long time
[21.09.21 14:25:47]
[21.09.21 14:25:57] alphonse: or rather they will be)
[21.09.21 14:26:24] elliott: I flushed the asset and adjusted configs to copy the corrected one after installation. the file was put in the root of the folder assets
[21.09.21 14:26:38]
[21.09.21 14:26:46] elliott: do you need something else to fuck off with?)
[21.09.21 14:28:26] elliott: i like redmayne tasks, no explanation, nothing, guess what to do
[21.09.21 14:28:32] alphonse: fuck the 639 for now.
[21.09.21 14:28:51] alphonse: it's not hard, but it's fucking hard
[21.09.21 14:29:07] elliott: What exactly is so fucking hard?
[21.09.21 14:29:20] elliott: It's just a menu in theory.
[21.09.21 14:29:57] elliott: Or do you have to fuck with the whole structure?
[21.09.21 14:30:10] alphonse: just rename the menu. maybe that's enough for them. but you might want to rename it purely and then it's both contollers and models and paths
[21.09.21 14:30:31] elliott: and base
[21.09.21 14:30:58] elliott: or in the base it's just bots with status, how are they made there?
[21.09.21 14:31:01] alphonse: the base can be left alone. there's only trait 4. let it stay
[21.09.21 14:31:44] elliott: is this status field in bot table?
[21.09.21 14:31:58] alphonse: type
[21.09.21 14:32:24] alphonse: status is alive/dead
[21.09.21 14:32:36] elliott: ah, fuck, we should also move that fucking asset to admin

[21.09.21 19:36:25] elliott: funny)) really with this piece of code, everything works without the plugin)) Fuck, so it was me, but a long time ago. I remember there was a simple solution.
[21.09.21 19:36:30] alphonse: in someone else's plugin
[21.09.21 19:36:35] elliott: reencrypt it
[21.09.21 19:36:36] elliott: can't see
[21.09.21 19:36:52] elliott: and yesterday it did not occur to me to do it) stupidly in the plugin corrected

[21.09.21 19:37:38] elliott: and yesterday it didn't occur to me to do it) just fixed it in the plugin
[21.09.21 19:38:13] elliott: it seemed to me that I already found the solution, and I don't need to get into plugin, but you confused me, like fuck you do
[21.09.21 19:38:15] elliott: So I did
[21.09.21 19:38:22] alphonse: i'm fucked up) i've fixed almost everywhere the command validation to normal
[21.09.21 19:38:48] alphonse: and here I'm screwed:
[21.09.21 19:40:07] alphonse: /index.php?r=bots%2Findex there are two GO buttons here now. if you press one - the command is validated, the other passes the bulk. how to combine them - I do not know
[21.09.21 19:42:37] elliott: I see one
[21.09.21 19:42:40] elliott: at 65
[21.09.21 19:43:00]
[21.09.21 19:45:50] elliott: still see one
[21.09.21 19:45:54] elliott: only the curve on the side
[21.09.21 19:46:09] elliott: under the comma tap
[21.09.21 19:46:13] elliott: and not near the selector
[21.09.21 19:46:31]
[21.09.21 19:47:40] alphonse: you need to develop) /view/bots/common/index.php in 225 to remove the nano display
[21.09.21 19:48:02] elliott: give me the whole page, there was a conflict with my shit
[21.09.21 19:48:03] elliott: I don't know.
[21.09.21 19:48:12] elliott: I'll paste it as it is out of harm's way
[21.09.21 19:48:59] elliott: I don't have those styles
[21.09.21 19:49:26] elliott: although I found it, on the wrong line. Now two curves)
[21.09.21 19:49:38] elliott: one got bumped under early commands
[21.09.21 19:49:47] elliott: one for command timeslip
[21.09.21 19:50:51] elliott: something you changed in the layout it's unclear why there are two
[21.09.21 19:52:29] alphonse: if you noticed we had 3 team building forms
[21.09.21 19:52:40] alphonse: I combined 3 into 1
[21.09.21 19:52:53] alphonse: _command-builder.php
[21.09.21 19:52:58] elliott: I haven't found it since 65
[21.09.21 19:53:02] elliott: only one more button
[21.09.21 19:53:12]
[21.09.21 19:53:19] alphonse: only in autoload
[21.09.21 19:55:22] alphonse: so the bot registry had a fucking fucked up form. i thought about simplifying - but fuck
[21.09.21 19:56:08] alphonse: if i don't find a solution - i'll have to roll back to yesterday((!
[21.09.21 19:56:10] alphonse: fuck!
[21.09.21 19:57:15] elliott: so i don't understand what you wanted to do
[21.09.21 19:57:50] alphonse: in general?
[21.09.21 19:58:07] elliott: well, at least with these buttons, why they became two
[21.09.21 19:58:39] alphonse: disable botCommandValidate functions everywhere and validate with internal model methods
[21.09.21 19:59:01] elliott: there were no two buttons before
[21.09.21 19:59:19] alphonse: that's why I want to merge
[21.09.21 19:59:20] elliott: I bumped into something in builder, then I chose bot
[21.09.21 19:59:31] elliott: early commands and go
[21.09.21 19:59:35] elliott: how bad was it?
[09/21/221 20:00:32] alphonse: there were a lot of crutches and a lot of unnecessary code. there were only three command-builders. and all in different places. now there is one
[21.09.21 20:00:51] alphonse: he has his own GO button
[21.09.21 20:01:02] alphonse: and bun has its own GO button
[21.09.21 20:01:14] elliott: but before he didn't have his own button
[21.09.21 20:01:32] alphonse: it didn't. there were three different forms
[21.09.21 20:01:40] elliott: Where the fuck are those forms?
[21.09.21 20:01:44] alphonse: all with a bunch of builder code
[21.09.21 20:02:12] alphonse: bot card, bot registry, batch command form
[21.09.21 20:03:01] elliott: you decided to refactor your builder so it wouldn't be dragged from three different places, but would be a single module?
[21.09.21 20:03:06] elliott: pluggable where needed?
[21.09.21 20:03:08] alphonse: yes
[21.09.21 20:03:13] elliott: you would have said so
[21.09.21 20:03:44] elliott: and how was it done in the list of bots, that there is no button, but in the bot card there is already?
[21.09.21 20:04:10] elliott: I would take out the general part, leaving only the dodger that holds the button where you need it, where you don't fucking need it, it's gone
[21.09.21 20:04:45] alphonse: before? there used to be a special builder
[21.09.21 20:04:49] elliott: go back to the way it was and see how it was wired in all three places, take the general out of there, leave the fucking button shit up to the controller
[21.09.21 20:04:55]
[21.09.21 20:05:21] elliott: well, let the bun remain as it was, it's only used in one place.
[21.09.21 20:05:27] elliott: for that place, connect it like it was
[21.09.21 20:05:45] alphonse: so what's the point? there were three builders, now there are two
[21.09.21 20:05:55] elliott: Why two?
[21.09.21 20:06:06] elliott: I just don't have an old version, I already rolled it up
[21.09.21 20:06:09] alphonse: there was a validation function - still is. and I want to throw it out
[21.09.21 20:06:28] elliott: but logically thinking, you have some shit that overrides the builder
[21.09.21 20:06:46] elliott: it's easier to keep it by taking the bilder itself out
[21.09.21 20:07:03] elliott: you need it on one page with a button, on another without, and the builder is the same
[21.09.21 20:07:36] alphonse: in the bot registry I used to rip out his button in the builder and put everything on the bullet
[21.09.21 20:07:55] alphonse: it's not really about the button
[21.09.21 20:08:14] alphonse: it's about different plugins that can't get along
[21.09.21 20:11:33] elliott: okay, let's say the button on the bots list is fucking hidden from the builder
[21.09.21 20:11:33] elliott: it's solvable
[21.09.21 20:11:36] elliott: That leaves the bulk button
[21.09.21 20:11:47] elliott: what prevents you from making it work for two?
[21.09.21 20:12:05] alphonse: validation
[21.09.21 20:12:20] alphonse: if you do that, normal validation doesn't work
[21.09.21 20:12:26] elliott: what kind of validation?
[21.09.21 20:13:08] alphonse: commands to bot
[21.09.21 20:13:08] alphonse: to make it work
[21.09.21 20:13:16] elliott: maybe just click on it while it's hidden?
[21.09.21 20:13:34] elliott: go over there like you did with styles, I see, and trigger click on it
[21.09.21 20:13:51]
[21.09.21 20:13:55] alphonse: that's what I thought too
[21.09.21 20:14:19] alphonse: $('#mainbotform').on('afterValidate', function (event, messages, errorAttributes) {
    if($('select[name=tasklist]').val()==0){
        let data = $('#mainbotform').data('yiiActiveForm');
        if (data.submitting && errorAttributes.length > 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return false;
});
[21.09.21 20:14:42] alphonse: when validation was correct, clicked on GO buns
[21.09.21 20:15:01] alphonse: but the fuck is that the submit continues after that
[21.09.21 20:15:04] elliott: so it's the other way around, you have to highjack the bun?
[21.09.21 20:15:12] elliott: I see a fucking sabmit, I wanted to ask
[21.09.21 20:15:14] alphonse: yeah
[21.09.21 20:15:28] alphonse: although I haven't decided which is better
[21.09.21 20:15:31] alphonse: I think so far
[21.09.21 20:16:51] alphonse: $('#gobulkbutton').trigger('click');
[21.09.21 20:16:56] alphonse: forgot the line
[21.09.21 20:16:57] elliott: so your event doesn't trigger, are you sure it exists?
[21.09.21 20:17:14] elliott: i didn't forget, i have atm this line, but the code doesn't work
[21.09.21 20:17:31] alphonse: everything works
[21.09.21 20:17:44] alphonse: make a command with an error and press GO
[21.09.21 20:17:52] alphonse: you'll get a fax from below
[21.09.21 20:17:59] elliott: i just press nothing
[21.09.21 20:18:36] alphonse: choose runexe and click. it will tell you to upload the file
[21.09.21 20:22:18] elliott: what if it submits with an empty selection?
[21.09.21 20:22:47] alphonse: there's no empty selection
[21.09.21 20:22:56] elliott: when nothing is selected
[21.09.21 20:23:00] alphonse: default command is nop 60
[21.09.21 20:23:37] alphonse: or rather it is by default
[21.09.21 20:26:33] elliott: I don't understand
[21.09.21 20:26:45] elliott: but in Builder it's a simple form and submit will submit it, is it wrong?
[21.09.21 20:27:09] alphonse: it's supposed to submit it
[21.09.21 20:27:29] alphonse: but how do you link it to a bun?
[21.09.21 20:27:31] elliott: that means when I don't select anything and click, it subsums and reloads the page
[21.09.21 20:27:34] elliott: is this normal?
[21.09.21 20:27:40] alphonse: yes
[21.09.21 20:27:51] elliott: Well, after the subshoot, all that logic is kind of fucked
[21.09.21 20:28:23] alphonse: you pick an empty command. timite 60 sec
[21.09.21 20:28:31] elliott: how did you want to sabmit the form
[21.09.21 20:28:36] elliott: reload page
[21.09.21 20:28:44] elliott: and save what happens
[21.09.21 20:29:30] elliott: how did it work before?
[21.09.21 20:30:00] alphonse: i thought that by returning false in the skipt after validation the sabot was interrupted. and then you can press the bulb
[21.09.21 20:30:13] elliott: so first the sabot
[21.09.21 20:30:28] elliott: there's gotta be a submit somewhere
[21.09.21 20:30:56] elliott: but then there's no validation event
[21.09.21 20:31:23] elliott: submit can be stopped on the fly, but BEFORE validation. any chance to trigger validation in between?
[21.09.21 20:31:31] alphonse: previously by clicking gobblet, i used a script to read the contents of bilder fields, put them into cookies and go to bilder
[21.09.21 20:32:10] alphonse: there is an event before the validation, but then validation fails
[21.09.21 20:32:28] elliott: validation will work by submit
[21.09.21 20:32:32]
[21.09.21 20:32:38] elliott: so if you want to stop the subbit, then validation won't work
[21.09.21 20:32:48] elliott: you have to stop the sabot and do the validation manually
[21.09.21 20:33:07] elliott: and then decide what to press next
[21.09.21 20:33:36] elliott: is this a built-in validator?
[21.09.21 20:33:40] elliott: factory?
[21.09.21 20:33:55] alphonse: the doc says that if you return false by afterValidate - your subbit is aborted
[21.09.21 20:34:08] elliott: well, we can see it interrupted as best we can

[21.09.21 20:57:45] elliott: try it
[21.09.21 20:57:53] elliott: last version gives an error and the bun clicks
[21.09.21 20:57:58] alphonse: tried it
[21.09.21 20:58:02] alphonse: it does not work
[21.09.21 20:58:08] elliott: it fucking won't work
[21.09.21 20:58:18] elliott: if you select renexe you'll get a validator error about the file
[21.09.21 20:58:25] elliott: if you choose nop, there's a bun modalka
[21.09.21 20:58:53]
[21.09.21 20:59:01] alphonse: ctrl f5
[21.09.21 20:59:25] elliott: there's a nuance if the bot is selected
[21.09.21 20:59:27] elliott: but this is a nuance
[21.09.21 21 21:00:17] elliott: more exactly, even if you select early, you get a validator message, and if you click again, the bun
[21.09.21 21:00:31] elliott: guess where the script went wrong
[21.09.21 21:00:34] elliott: but I think that's solvable
[21.09.21 21:00:56] alphonse: no way
[21.09.21 21:01:09] alphonse: no matter how many times you click, there's no fixing it
[21.09.21 21:01:16] elliott: I got nothing
[21.09.21 21:01:21] elliott: second click - modalka
[21.09.21 21:01:40] elliott: So is the scheme working?
[21.09.21 21:01:49] alphonse: it seems so.
[21.09.21 21:01:55] elliott: Well, thank God.
[21.09.21 21:01:59] elliott: I'm gonna go sleep on it
[21.09.21 21:02:25] elliott: Nothing to eat
[21.09.21 21:05:36] alphonse: there's only one nuance: if you give commands one after another, at some point validation gets cut off
[21.09.21 21:05:36] alphonse: 100% fucked up
[22.09.21 08:21:26] elliott: did you upload it to the git?
[22.09.21 08:36:46] alphonse: yes
[22.09.21 11:52:51] elliott: text the nickname
[22.09.21 11:52:54] elliott: please
[22.09.21 11:52:56] elliott: I'm here
[22.09.21 11:53:13] elliott: I answer the question "here?" like it fell on the keyboard
[22.09.21 11:58:48] alphonse: to whom?
[22.09.21 11:59:12] elliott: that's it, I got through to him already
[22.09.21 11:59:16] elliott: do you have any money?
[22.09.21 11:59:24] alphonse: no
[22.09.21 11:59:26] alphonse: why?
[22.09.21 11:59:42] elliott: servers are up, no kurt, no one has any dough
[22.09.21 11:59:50] elliott: If they shut it down, it's gonna be another universal tragedy
[22.09.21 12:00:11] elliott: And when he shows up, who knows?
[22.09.21 12:00:23] alphonse: write to sylver. or it's not about his projects?
[22.09.21 12:00:43] elliott: i don't think he knows what it's about. it's an old admin store of stolen goods
[22.09.21 12:00:54] elliott: he had a kid make it.
[22.09.21 12:01:13] elliott: I'd fuckin' love to bring it back up again when they shut it down, man
[22.09.21 12:01:32] alphonse: in the toad, knock on who
[22.09.21 12:01:42] elliott: i don't even have a toad for ages
[22.09.21 12:02:27] elliott: by the way, what about the toad? it was "ai-yi-yi! no way"
[22.09.21 12:02:34] elliott: And everyone here is using a toad, I guess.
[22.09.21 12:02:41] alphonse: as an emergency
[22.09.21 12:02:42] elliott: they do
[22.09.21 12:02:48] alphonse: find who
[28.09.21 13:52:01] elliott: I'll be gone by tomorrow if you don't need it
[28.09.21 13:52:07] elliott: to the village
[28.09.21 14:05:19]
[29.09.21 09:16:12] elliott: heating fucks with your mind
[30.09.21 09:37:20] elliott: i'm not really sure what server we're talking about
[30.09.21 09:37:34] elliott: and whether you can do anything there with your dirty hands at all
[30.09.21 09:38:12] elliott: lch5?
[30.09.21 09:43:53] alphonse: yes
[30.09.21 10:14:14] elliott: this 159 turns out. it has all the latest changes on it?
[30.09.21 10:14:23] elliott: nothing new in the git
[30.09.21 10:15:01] alphonse: yes. i poured directly from my PC there
[30.09.21 10:15:17] alphonse: turn on debugging on the backend and see what's there
[30.09.21 10:15:30] elliott: I'll look, but how to fix it
[30.09.21 10:15:33] elliott: If there's no code
[30.09.21 10:16:03] alphonse: I didn't get into your fiefdom beyond css
[30.09.21 10:16:31] elliott: I plowed through the controller of this shit, everything worked... how he found this error I wonder...
[30.09.21 10:16:55]
[30.09.21 10:17:04] alphonse: some shit will happen
[30.09.21 10:17:09] alphonse: small
[30.09.21 10:17:16] alphonse: you didn't even think
[30.09.21 10:19:16] elliott: the fuck.
[30.09.21 10:19:29] elliott: it's not an error, it's a redirect to the main page and there's the text
[30.09.21 10:19:38] elliott: as usual, kolyan can't fucking explain what happened
[30.09.21 10:19:53] elliott: But it's no less interesting what the fuck
[30.09.21 10:23:04] elliott: how do you turn on the debug? i put tru and devs on the web and nothing
[30.09.21 10:23:04] elliott: no logs at all
[30.09.21 10:24:09] alphonse: so it should be on
[30.09.21 10:24:17] elliott: It's not working
[30.09.21 10:24:34] elliott: the answer is a 500 and a frame with the text like "something is broken"
[30.09.21 10:24:42] alphonse: turn on debug in mein pxp. the petal will appear
[30.09.21 10:25:27] elliott: where is this parameter?
[30.09.21 10:27:57] alphonse: in mein local, sorry

[22.10.21 08:16:29] alphonse: you got it?
[22.10.21 08:37:09] elliott: let me see if I can figure this out
[22.10.21 12:19:09] elliott: what's with all the hate attacks?
[22.10.21 12:19:27] elliott: the last time I was asked to put everything into the git was five minutes before I was fired)
[22.10.21 12:20:02] alphonse: well, it was told to me 10 times already)
[22.10.21 12:20:08] elliott: about the git?
[22.10.21 12:20:48] alphonse: yeah
[22.10.21 12:21:54] elliott: if they fuck you up, what are you gonna do?
[22.10.21 12:22:05] elliott: Try to get a real job.
[22.10.21 17:16:39] elliott: That's it.
[22.10.21 17:16:44] elliott: have you done enough work for today?
[22.10.21 17:17:00]
[22.10.21 17:17:18] elliott: I took a look at these bots too, what's the gimmick?
[22.10.21 17:17:24] elliott: why the fuck are there so many?
[25.10.21 09:49:31] elliott: tell me how to download the archive? I can't remember any services
[25.10.21 09:50:12] elliott: tell me how to download the archive? I can't remember any services
[25.10.21 09:52:15] elliott: fe
[25.10.21 09:52:16] elliott: Ow!
[25.10.21 11:09:43] elliott: I'm telling you, that's exactly how I got fired before) Show me where the fuck is it? It's fucked up! Within an hour to redo it!))
[25.10.21 11:09:47] elliott: Very familiar.
[10/25/1921 11:10:25] elliott: No.
[25.10.21 11:11:03] elliott: I just look at the hits and the deadlines and it's very similar to the office I was kicked out of in the past with the exact same fuck-ups
[25.10.21 11:11:30] elliott: only threats from here so far)
[25.10.21 11:12:01] elliott: found a fucking bash-scribbler, I'm tired of googling to do it all somehow)
[25.10.21 11:12:29] elliott: well, on the other hand, it's good to know how this shit is done
[25.10.21 11:14:13] elliott: I fuck knows, I think booza would have had the sense to tell me about it himself, instead of making a circus. Just reminiscent of
[25.10.21 11:14:39] elliott: maybe he was just trying to make me angry, I don't know.
[25.10.21 11:15:07] elliott: And the rest will get a little fucked up and start moving.
[25.10.21 11:15:54] elliott: i'm already starting to think it would be calmer if they were fired. at least i won't be nervous at last, i'm getting paranoid
[25.10.21 11:16:24] elliott: go quietly shitcore myself and not be afraid to open my laptop
[25.10.21 11:16:51] elliott: it's not clear what to write on your resume.)
[25.10.21 11:17:06] elliott: "fucked with hackers since '14"?
[25.10.21 11:17:32] elliott: I wish he was doing something smart, but he was always doing some bullshit too
[26.10.21 08:34:06] elliott: ps
[26.10.21 08:34:13] elliott: I got a question that's been bugging me
[26.10.21 08:34:41] elliott: I've decided to fuck pride and give up. How the fuck do I do a role and rights check?)
[26.10.21 08:35:04] elliott: the manuals are so inarticulate that I already want to rewrite the fuck out of them on laravel)
[26.10.21 08:43:53] elliott: can't see
[27.10.21 12:57:28] elliott: find yourself a substitute, if this keeps up, it'll be easier for me to format the fuck out of this laptop and not bother myself)
[27.10.21 12:57:41] elliott: I get tired of listening to this bullshit every five minutes
[27.10.21 12:58:29] alphonse: well... whoever gets it
[27.10.21 13:00:04] alphonse: just tell me your intentions clearly so I can audit your activities: what to keep and what to rewrite
[27.10.21 13:02:44] elliott: the chat room's a little slow
[27.10.21 13:02:51] elliott: I have no intentions.
I just see it on the booze
[27.10.21 13:03:29] elliott: all this pussyfooting, do everything within an hour, make it work like clockwork otherwise it's bullshit, show me this, show me that, and in the end the fuck he even tried it, that is, he didn't fucking need it
[27.10.21 13:03:47] elliott: i have no intention
[27.10.21 13:03:49] elliott: i just see them in the bouza
[27.10.21 13:04:58] elliott: oh, he's getting the message.
[27.10.21 13:05:54] elliott: deb take from last git?
[27.10.21 13:06:13] elliott: or i won't survive
[27.10.21 13:06:36] elliott: I haven't shot today, I have yesterday's
[27.10.21 13:07:13] elliott: and by the way, we haven't thought about updates.
[27.10.21 13:07:27] elliott: I don't know, I may not be there tonight
[27.10.21 13:12:58] elliott: you have to think of something about it, like, if the program is already installed, then just update the pxp
[27.10.21 13:17:58] elliott: permutation denade
[27.10.21 13:18:00] elliott: passwords don't work
[27.10.21 16:43:33] elliott: I see you're all very interested in the new admin area.)
[27.10.21 16:44:01] elliott: of the hour I spent on installing it, half an hour I was waiting for the grinya and half an hour negotiating what needs to be done, and he also had time to drop the server and went to the hoster
[28.10.21 09:24:44] elliott: I read the situation and have a question
[28.10.21 09:25:30] elliott: my installer sets the rules for crone, and you say there's some kind of alleged bug
[28.10.21 09:26:29] alphonse: don't know where this bug is
[28.10.21 09:26:54] alphonse: i have a suspicion that it is unclear how restor happens. that's why files disappear
[28.10.21 09:28:17] elliott: no, if you mean today's situation, it probably has nothing to do with restor
[28.10.21 09:30:57] elliott: wouldn't it turn out that the backup wasn't updated because you messed up the cron?
[28.10.21 09:31:00] elliott: it would be ouch
[28.10.21 09:34:04]
[28.10.21 10:03:47] alphonse: where did you end up yesterday?
[28.10.21 10:03:58] alphonse: with the new admin
[28.10.21 10:04:18] elliott: well, i wrote yesterday, you were online
[28.10.21 10:04:26] elliott: they picked it up and gave it to me to check, but nobody gave a fuck
[28.10.21 10:04:47]
[28.10.21 10:05:21] elliott: no
[28.10.21 10:06:17] alphonse: what's the suffix?
[28.10.21 10:07:27] elliott: suffix of what?
[28.10.21 10:08:18] alphonse: did you change the pass there?
[28.10.21 10:08:48] alphonse: to root
[28.10.21 10:08:59] elliott: no, I didn't change anything
[28.10.21 10:09:04] elliott: your root pass is just wrong
[28.10.21 10:09:08] elliott: I told you that too
[28.10.21 10:09:17] alphonse: the suffix is sOIDFhsAIUfhu42332uygt27634ft7yuaFGyaugkJFsayjegf--_-GBASfdvt23fv
[28.10.21 10:09:24] elliott: ah, it's an url
[28.10.21 10:09:28] elliott: same as always.
[28.10.21 10:10:07]
[28.10.21 10:10:14] alphonse: he must be different
[28.10.21 10:10:26] alphonse: Give me the right pass
[28.10.21 10:11:24] elliott: iS96W84w8mHqZNt
[28.10.21 10:11:36] elliott: We weren't supposed to change it.
[28.10.21 10:12:04] elliott: grinya created a user there for the admin
[28.10.21 13:29:28]
[28.10.21 13:32:07] elliott: not sure
[28.10.21 13:32:15] elliott: I don't understand everything they're saying
[28.10.21 13:32:17] elliott: but what the fuck to do
[28.10.21 13:33:35] alphonse: I'll be there in a couple of hours
[28.10.21 16:33:28] elliott: about the search
[28.10.21 16:33:29] elliott: it works on my local.
[29.10.21 11:24:05] alphonse: is it you and kolyan yeret that when you slash in groups the file will be deleted completely?
[29.10.21 11:54:39] elliott: no, I do not remember it
[29.10.21 11:54:40] elliott: if I'm not mistaken, it worked like that right away
[29.10.21 12:23:51] alphonse: it worked. but i remember i asked you to clear fields and not to kill file or record
[29.10.21 12:56:59] elliott: no
[29.10.21 12:57:03] elliott: I didn't ask for that
[29.10.21 12:57:47] elliott: And they did it a long time ago, and Koljan tested it, and you tested it too, why now it turns out that the file shouldn't be deleted? It wasn't like that.
[29.10.21 13:09:22] alphonse: it means I have skoerosis and dementia. well, ok. now I have to
[29.10.21 13:22:37] elliott: just tell me what to do.
[29.10.21 13:26:57] alphonse: pressing the oblique cross should clear all the fields of the corresponding section
[29.10.21 13:27:06] alphonse: that's it
[29.10.21 13:27:57] alphonse: if you press check button in the list - all fields should be filled with data of checked file
[29.10.21 13:28:44] alphonse: you can also introduce validation condition: if all the fields are empty - ok
[29.10.21 13:39:00] alphonse: ku
[29.10.21 15:01:26] elliott: just erase the fields, so that when you reload the page they are in place again? don't delete anything from the database?
[29.10.21 15:01:41] elliott: is the slash icon next to the file name?
[01.11.21 10:13:33] elliott: ps
[01.11.21 10:13:38] elliott: what are the instructions?
[01.11.21 10:13:53] alphonse: ku
[01.11.21 10:14:13] alphonse: let me clear up a list of ipis for prefix
[17.11.21 15:58:01] elliott: i filled in validation, i fixed http. validator checks private key for format and if it's normal and similar to key, it tries to encrypt-decrypt the string. There's no special way to check public key, only external format.
[17.11.21 15:58:10] elliott: The fuck is in the ajax controller
[11/23/11/21 10:47:18] elliott: ps
[11/23/11/21 10:47:19] elliott: koo
[23.11.21 10:47:31] elliott: did you upload my stuff to 65? Kohler wants to test it
[11/23/11/21 10:48:20] alphonse: no
[11/23/221 10:48:23] alphonse: I'll pour it in.
[11/23/221 10:50:45] alphonse: ready
[23.11.21 10:54:20] elliott: did you set up the port?
[23.11.21 10:54:26] elliott: you need a separate port for that shit
[11/23/11/21 11:01:54] alphonse: where is web root?
[11/23/11/21 11:02:41] elliott: what do you mean? which web root?
[11/23/11/221 11:02:46] elliott: where do you want the public to go?
[11/23/11/221 11:02:56] alphonse: index.php where do you look?
[11/23/11/21 11:03:16] elliott: just like in the api for example
[11/23/11/21 11:03:20] elliott: just httpapi or whatever it is
[11.11.21 11:03:26] elliott: apihttp
[11/23/11/21 11:03:31] alphonse: okay. it's not there
[11/23/11/21 11:03:57] elliott: in the apihttp folder
[11/23/11/21 11:04:00] elliott: inside the web folder
[11/23/11/21 11:04:02] elliott: not in it?
[23.11.21 11:04:14] elliott: apihttp/web/index.php
[11/23/11/21 11:04:15] alphonse: Nope.
[11/23/11/21 11:04:23] elliott: why the hell didn't he get into the git or something?
[11.11.21 11:04:38] elliott: It's weird, he's added to the rep
[23.11.21 11:04:39] alphonse: it shouldn't be. will the api do it?

[11/23/221 13:08:41] alphonse: ew-ha-ha
[11/23/221 13:08:52] elliott: i don't get it
[11/23/11/21 13:09:08] alphonse: I'll tell you about it later]
[23.11.21 13:09:13] elliott: something broken?
[23.11.21 13:09:43] alphonse: at least 2 tascas without it
[11/23/11/21 13:09:58] alphonse: or make crutches
[23.11.21 13:10:09] elliott: so there are sessions by nature
[23.11.21 13:11:27] alphonse: there are. but you will have to chain parameters to them, and this is a table
[23.11.21 13:11:50] elliott: what do you mean? the session parameters are also natural
[23.11.21 13:12:07] elliott: what kind of tabs?
[23.11.21 13:12:32] alphonse: everything
[11/23/221 13:12:33] alphonse: gone
[11/23/221 13:12:35] alphonse: later
[23.11.21 16:08:38] alphonse: you don't remember this fucking thing: is the session for each browser window separate or shared?
[23.11.21 16:17:15] elliott: shared in the context of the connection
[23.11.21 16:17:26] elliott: I mean, for the client

public key has illegal format! when trying to re-save file with prefix .australia/addrtest1/tst0421
[24.11.21 10:18:24] alphonse: Kolya says the key is correct
[24.11.21 10:23:57] elliott: how do I look without the key?
[24.11.21 10:24:50] alphonse: but it's there
[24.11.21 10:25:13] elliott: it's blank everywhere
[24.11.21 10:25:54] elliott: found it.
[24.11.21 10:25:56] elliott: I'll take a look.
[24.11.21 10:26:16] alphonse: I fixed it already. but someone typed it in twice
[24.11.21 11:54:27] elliott: yeah, fuck, sorry, was busy, just saw they put in a wrong key and fucking swear, you know
[24.11.21 12:16:38] alphonse: try any command from the bot registry to any bot. it'll turn into an internet
[24.11.21 12:17:01] alphonse: at 65
[24.11.21 12:17:28] alphonse: see, there's something wrong in Kolyan's browser
[24.11.21 12:17:53] elliott: tell me what to do
[24.11.21 12:17:54] alphonse: and i want to know if it's in his browser or somewhere else
[24.11.21 12:18:17] elliott: I'm not good with your terms, what will become a command do not understand
[24.11.21 12:18:52] elliott: opening any bot, even a dead one?
[24.11.21 12:19:02]
[24.11.21 12:19:08] alphonse: yes
[24.11.21 12:19:16] elliott: 37d778605d714b6a6d64cfe4a72d7ecf
[24.11.21 12:19:27] elliott: Command Type?
[24.11.21 12:19:34] alphonse: but not from the registry
[24.11.21 12:19:55] elliott: what is the registry?
[24.11.21 12:20:09] alphonse: bot list main
[24.11.21 12:20:17] elliott: Well, I chose the first bot there
[24.11.21 12:20:35] elliott: next in the list of commands is the timepiece?
[24.11.21 12:21:12] elliott: ah, or chenut bot in the list and select the command at the top?
[24.11.21 12:21:29] alphonse: did you set the birdie? just press GO. should appear in the list of commands bot nop 50
[24.11.21 12:21:31] alphonse: yes
[24.11.21 12:22:02] elliott: dick
[24.11.21 12:23:08] elliott: it's not about scripts, it's a simple post form
[24.11.21 12:23:42] alphonse: it's an ajax pass in the bay
[24.11.21 12:23:48] alphonse: back
[24.11.21 12:23:48] elliott: there is no ajax
[24.11.21 12:23:51] elliott: only post
[24.11.21 12:24:18] elliott: and I don't see the selected command in the query
[24.11.21 12:24:29] alphonse: are you on 65 or you? you don't have it yet
[24.11.21 12:24:36] elliott: at 65
[24.11.21 12:25:13] elliott: I choose a command in Command Type, check the first bot and press go.  Browser only sends form by submit without selecting command number
[24.11.21 12:26:12] elliott: ah, i also found, while the confirmation window pops up, there really is some ajax

[24.11.21 12:26:34] elliott: but there's no command number in it either
[24.11.21 12:26:38] elliott: and in general the parameters are incomprehensible
[24.11.21 12:27:24] elliott: there's 184 command ID in the list, there's some number 60
[24.11.21 12:28:48] alphonse: everything is correct
[24.11.21 12:29:30] alphonse: well
[24.11.21 12:29:40] elliott: so it's not an ajax that sets the command anyway
[24.11.21 12:30:40] elliott: I mean, yes, by an ajax, but by submitting a form and without a command number
[24.11.21 12:31:04] elliott: did you invent to collect them beforehand by the first query and store in a session, and then to input them into the database by pressing a button?
[24.11.21 12:32:03] alphonse: you'll have to fuck with it))) everything is in the git
[24.11.21 12:32:23] elliott: how fast do you have to fuck this up?
[24.11.21 12:32:41] alphonse: i keep s session what the plugin can't transfer other than his checks
[24.11.21 12:33:09] elliott: tell me an idea what you're doing there, why these queries
[24.11.21 12:33:25] alphonse: now you have to. kolyan is raging)) but everything works for me
[24.11.21 12:34:34] alphonse: there is a bulk plugin. it can't pass anything except list of checks, and we also need command type and command itself
[24.11.21 12:35:00] alphonse: that's why I write the type of command and command in the session
[24.11.21 12:35:36] alphonse: and then by confirmation in the controller read the session
[24.11.21 12:36:09] alphonse: i used cookies, but cookies not all characters and limited by size
[24.11.21 13:50:11] elliott: how do you hear?

[07.12.21 19:20:23] alphonse: I would save it with command lines
[07.12.21 19:24:22] elliott: there will be more indexes than data

[10.12.21 08:38:39] alphonse: koo
[10.12.21 08:44:48] elliott: what's that VPN bridge? sylver asked me yesterday
[10.12.21 08:46:11] alphonse: i gave it to alkes a year ago. why?
[10.12.21 08:48:47] elliott: yesterday he came in asking who's doing it
[10.12.21 08:48:52] elliott: I had no idea.
[10.12.21 08:48:56] elliott: What the hell is that even?
[10.12.21 08:50:58] alphonse: bullshit
[10.12.21 08:51:20] alphonse: in the bridge thread sylver and alexio are corresponding
[10.12.21 08:51:29] alphonse: so it's okay
[12/13/221 10:54:50] elliott: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-views/
[12/13/221 11:30:12] alphonse: I didn't find there that all this stuff is in memory
[12/13/221 11:33:57] elliott: Note that regular views do not store any data except the materialized views. In PostgreSQL, you can create special views called materialized views that store data physically and periodically refresh data from the base tables.
[13.12.21 11:34:24] elliott: i understand it creates a temporary table like a query cache but i can't remember exactly how the fuck it works
[12/13/221 11:34:49] elliott: but i remember we were using views and the guy who made them insisted on it because the queries were fuckin' stupid
[13.12.21 11:36:12] elliott: you could try caching the queries
[13.12.21 11:36:31] alphonse: no point in bothering with it on a table of 17k records
[13.12.21 11:36:44] elliott: the busa fucks with the queries

[12/13/221 11:39:04] elliott: both cache and material views
[20.12.21 09:53:27] elliott: Ps.
[20.12.21 09:53:31] elliott: Need help
[20.12.21 09:54:08] elliott: I got an update on Ubuntu and the project fucked up, can't put it back together
[20.12.21 09:54:18]
[20.12.21 09:54:22] alphonse: fix it
[20.12.21 09:54:26] elliott: files from uia's git don't fit, it's already 600 versions ahead
[20.12.21 09:54:37] elliott: from their off-guitar
[20.12.21 09:54:49] elliott: you need a full working version, no riddles
[20.12.21 09:55:08] elliott: or at least all those files like wiii wiii wiii.bat and whatnot
[20.12.21 09:55:15] elliott: There was a dnsb file
[20.12.21 09:55:21] alphonse: download from 141
[20.12.21 09:55:45] alphonse: tho working battle
[20.12.21 09:55:46] elliott: this is fucked up
[20.12.21 09:56:15] elliott: the fucking updaters, i don't even understand shit, nothing works, and it crashed me postgres and pxp and everything else, and it won't go back, bitch
[12/20/1921 10:04:00] alphonse: updated to 21.10?
[20.12.21 10:13:16] elliott: Yeah.
[20.12.21 10:53:51] elliott: something i don't understand
[12/20/221 10:53:52] elliott: require(/var/www/html/advanced-project/vendor/autoload.php): failed to open stream
[12/20/221 10:53:59] elliott: why isn't autoload vendor?
[20.12.21 10:54:07] elliott: it was somehow born there automatically?
[20.12.21 10:55:09] elliott: well, yes, if you remove it from the composer...
[20.12.21 11:32:25] elliott: An internal server error occurred.
[20.12.21 11:32:27] elliott: and no errors in the logs
[20.12.21 11:32:31] elliott: how to enable debugging?
[20.12.21 11:37:00] elliott: all found, migration is missing
[20.12.21 11:37:06] alphonse: in index.php files top two lines
[20.12.21 11:37:31] elliott: new fucking quest
[20.12.21 11:37:36] elliott: git says I'm updated
[20.12.21 11:37:44] elliott: but there's no new, like migration with sessions
[20.12.21 11:40:05] elliott: and i don't understand how to get updates
[12/20/221 12:02:40] elliott: with message 'Calling unknown method: m211217_074103_session::bytea()'
[20.12.21 12:02:42] elliott: what the hell is that?
[20.12.21 12:03:31] alphonse: there is such a data type in postgre
[20.12.21 12:03:42] elliott: it says no
[20.12.21 12:09:16] elliott: it is in postgres, but the framework knows nothing about it
[20.12.21 12:09:19] elliott: how did you roll out the migration?
[20.12.21 12:09:47] alphonse: did not check it.
[20.12.21 12:09:57] elliott: reliable plan, Lebowski))
[20.12.21 12:10:02] elliott: like a Swiss watch)
[20.12.21 12:10:32] elliott: Why the fuck is there such a weird data type?
[20.12.21 12:10:58] alphonse: it's built in shit for sessions
[20.12.21 12:11:19] elliott: i know, i mean, what's the table for? what's stored there?
[20.12.21 12:11:48] alphonse: string in general. but if you make a char or text - error
[20.12.21 12:12:48] elliott: The bytea data type allows storage of binary strings
[20.12.21 12:12:54] elliott: you're storing something interesting there
[20.12.21 12:14:01] elliott: 'data' => $this->binary(),
[20.12.21 12:14:05] elliott: I think so
[20.12.21 12:18:16] elliott: Getting unknown property: backend\models\Admin::auth_key
[20.12.21 12:18:16] elliott: Fuck.
[20.12.21 12:18:19] elliott: what the hell is that?
[20.12.21 12:19:04] elliott: there's no such field in the admin table
[20.12.21 12:25:33] elliott: i made changes in migrations and in admin too, added this field, i don't know where the fuck it went
[12/24/21 09:30:53] elliott: psst
[12/24/21 10:05:44] alphonse: koo
[12/24/21 10:13:04] elliott: what's up?
[12/24/221 10:17:08] elliott: yesterday i got a 1 on the dialog, but the dialog was empty, so i think, maybe he wanted to ask me something, like who i am and what i do
[24.12.21 10:17:15] elliott: so I know what to answer, what am I doing
[24.12.21 10:18:16] elliott: Put me on speaker if you have to.
[24.12.21 10:40:16] alphonse: you have apihttp did you test it with someone?
[24.12.21 10:40:30] elliott: with kolyan
[12/24/21 10:40:49] elliott: today it's not working and I can't figure out why, it returns 403
[24.12.21 10:41:03] elliott: rocco's busy, what the fuck is up with the configs
[24.12.21 10:41:06] elliott: everything was working
[24.12.21 10:43:50] alphonse: i can give it to you if you want to try it)))
[24.12.21 10:47:19] elliott: tell me about the sex.)
[24.12.21 10:53:18] alphonse: sometimes you need to pass variables through the session
[24.12.21 10:53:34] alphonse: when session is on files, everything works
[24.12.21 10:53:44] alphonse: when on base - no
[24.12.21 10:54:20] alphonse: you have to find a way to fix it or define that it doesn't work
[24.12.21 10:55:01] elliott: you need to refresh the essence of the problem, what was the bug and why you decided to transfer variables in a non-traditional way
[24.12.21 10:55:26] elliott: some search didn't work with pagination it seems?
[24.12.21 10:55:36] alphonse: there is such a procedure bulk
[24.12.21 10:56:04] alphonse: it passes only set of checks from bot registry for example
[24.12.21 10:56:17] alphonse: and what to do if you need something else?
[24.12.21 10:56:25] alphonse: only with cookies or session
[24.12.21 10:56:41] alphonse: but cookies have length limit
[24.12.21 10:56:51] elliott: wait, I've reinstalled everything and I have an empty database
[24.12.21 10:56:56] elliott: where do you look for that anyway?
[24.12.21 10:57:07] elliott: and where would you get the database with the data?
[24.12.21 10:57:38] alphonse: at least pull it from 65
[24.12.21 10:57:39] elliott: is the set of checks checked on the bots you want to apply some command to in bulk?
[24.12.21 10:57:49] alphonse: yes
[24.12.21 10:57:58] elliott: at 65 on the tables will match? you remember, I changed migrations there to work
[24.12.21 10:58:24] alphonse: I think I just added crerate_at into sessions
[24.12.21 10:58:53] elliott: i added it to the migration, i will add it to the table if necessary, and how do i pull it from 65?
[24.12.21 10:59:21] elliott: it hurts my ass every time
[12/24/21 10:59:32] alphonse: go to ssh. dump and download
[24.12.21 10:59:34] elliott: connecting to postgres and stealing the base is fucked up
[24.12.21 10:59:52] alphonse: what's there to connect to?
[12/24/21 10:59:57] alphonse: go in
[12/24/21 11:00:13] elliott: logged on.
[12/24/21 11:00:22] alphonse: su - postgres
[24.12.21 11:01:00] alphonse: pg_dump backdoor > mydump.sql
[24.12.21 11:01:29] alphonse: then go to mc and download
[24.12.21 11:02:57] alphonse: then when you restore try to move bot from partition to partition
[24.12.21 11:03:04] alphonse: ah, stop
[12/24/221 11:03:58] alphonse: .//'class' => '\backend\components\CustomDbSession',
            //'sessionTable' => 'session',
[24.12.21 11:04:23] alphonse: here are two lines. if they're disabled - your session is through files
[24.12.21 11:04:29] alphonse: if not - via base\
[24.12.21 11:04:59] alphonse: so if it's moved, it works, if not - fuck
[24.12.21 11:05:29] alphonse: public function actionSettaskdata(){

        return;

    }
[24.12.21 11:06:28] alphonse: this is where I checked by re-reading the session - the variables are saved

[24.12.21 11:07:12]
[24.12.21 11:07:26] alphonse: when sessions are on files - everything is ok
[24.12.21 11:07:54] alphonse: need to understand where they go
[24.12.21 11:08:12] alphonse: I guess php opens another session for some reason
[24.12.21 11:08:24] alphonse: and it has a different id
[24.12.21 11:10:55] elliott: where should I look for these two lines?
[24.12.21 11:29:17] alphonse: allajax and backendbotscontroller
[24.12.21 11:38:41] elliott: and how to load the base on the local machine now?
[24.12.21 11:55:16] elliott: and what botadmin password is there?
[24.12.21 11:56:48] elliott: That's it, I figured it out.
[12/24/21 18:59:03] alphonse: go to psql
[24.12.21 18:59:03] alphonse: psql backdoor < mydump.sql\
[24.12.21 18:59:04] alphonse: drop database backdoor;
[24.12.21 18:59:04] alphonse: more specifically psql drop database backdoor
[27.12.21 12:02:32] elliott: two days I can't call Rocco
[27.12.21 12:02:47] elliott: 403 on 65 on my module, and I don't know why
[27.12.21 14:40:29] elliott: with sessions I don't understand why the fuck I did it in the first place
[27.12.21 14:41:28] elliott: what prevents you from adding the task parameter to the bulk query?
[27.12.21 14:52:44] elliott: although... it's strange, it should work
[27.12.21 14:52:57] elliott: why is this session different
[27.12.21 15:12:16] alphonse: how do you intend to add parameters to bulk query without changing plugin itself?
[27.12.21 15:12:47] elliott: thought it was your button
[27.12.21 15:13:48] elliott: Shit, I thought I already fixed that
[27.12.21 15:14:16] elliott: there was something wrong with the sessions...
[27.12.21 16:01:55] elliott: without a custom session, the parameter is passed
[27.12.21 16:02:14] elliott: why did you make a custom session?
[27.12.21 16:06:01] alphonse: the custom session captures user sessions via database and deletes them by itself. it's a built-in crap. how else to capture user output i can't imagine
[27.12.21 16:06:03] elliott: there are billions of records in the table, which by the way need to be cleaned by yourself
[27.12.21 16:06:51] alphonse: sessions ? something went wrong. they cleaned themselves somehow
[27.12.21 16:07:51] alphonse: \Well, there's a crutch: server pinging every minute
[27.12.21 16:08:11] alphonse: we have a task for the near future: audit
[27.12.21 16:08:34] elliott: one request created - two table entries at once
[27.12.21 16:09:05] alphonse: if you make a logout - all records are deleted)
[27.12.21 16:09:26] elliott: nobody ever makes a logout
[27.12.21 16:09:58] elliott: two entries per request
[27.12.21 16:11:18] alphonse: sometimes more.
[27.12.21 16:12:36] elliott: but sessions don't work with this system
[27.12.21 16:12:41] elliott: i don't fucking understand
[27.12.21 16:12:50] elliott: built-in session perfectly holds the parameters between requests
[27.12.21 16:14:31] alphonse: so it fucking works and you can ping the user with pings. in your script with the server clock you can add a ping every 60 sec to some controller (make it up yourself) in allajax
[27.12.21 16:14:43] elliott: wait
[27.12.21 16:14:48] elliott: why do we need to track a user?
[27.12.21 16:15:26] alphonse: bosses want to see when someone entered/exited and what he did/did not do
[27.12.21 16:16:18] alphonse: and being online in real time
[27.12.21 16:16:31] elliott: and how do these custom sessions help with that?
[27.12.21 16:17:46] alphonse: there is somehow logging to the database from each session.
[27.12.21 16:18:13] alphonse: after expired the record is deleted
[27.12.21 16:18:43] elliott: there's nothing but the user id
[27.12.21 16:18:50] elliott: And where do the bosses even see who's doing what?
[27.12.21 16:21:59] alphonse: there's shit in the plug-ins
[27.12.21 16:22:19] elliott: without those sessions you're fucked,
[27.12.21 16:22:20] elliott: ?
[27.12.21 16:23:24] alphonse: if you make a session in the files as it works now, then the user online can only be traced by ping. well, I can't imagine otherwise
[27.12.21 16:26:53] elliott: i just fell out of the mainstream, what you guys were up to
[27.12.21 16:31:28] elliott: the main problem is what? where is the user tracked?
[27.12.21 16:31:34] elliott: how can I see it?
[27.12.21 16:35:33] elliott: fuck, and by the way, something interesting is going on in the database, every minute the postgres process gets fucking hung up
[27.12.21 16:35:37] elliott: And it hangs the whole system
[27.12.21 16:36:24] elliott: or it's some cron that triggers...
[27.12.21 16:40:34] elliott: fuck, sure, the whole root cron is full of tascas
[27.12.21 16:40:38] elliott: fuckin' bullshit
[27.12.21 16:40:49] elliott: why isn't it cleared when you aninstall the app
[27.12.21 16:41:57] elliott: your servers can fuck up the same way, check it on occasion
[27.12.21 16:42:02] elliott: so there wouldn't be a pizzotask in the crone
[12/27/221 16:46:47] elliott: If you want to access session data via $_SESSION while using custom session storage, you must make sure that the session has already been started by yii\web\Session::open(). This is because custom session storage handlers are registered within this method.
[27.12.21 16:46:51] elliott: If you use a custom session storage you may need to configure the session garbage collector explicitly. Some installations of PHP (e.g. Debian) use a garbage collector probability of 0 and clean session files offline in a cronjob. This process does not apply to your custom storage so you need to configure yii\web\Session::$GCProbability to use a non-zero value.
[27.12.21 16:49:14]
[27.12.21 16:49:29] alphonse: did you build all indexes I gave you?
[27.12.21 16:49:38] elliott: yes
[27.12.21 16:49:47] elliott: I had a million crowns created and the system crashed
[27.12.21 16:49:50] elliott: I fucking deleted everything
[27.12.21 16:50:11] elliott: did you read what the manual said? nothing about the custom session works by itself
[27.12.21 16:50:22] elliott: but that doesn't answer the question why the fuck it doesn't hold parameters
[27.12.21 16:53:22] elliott: what's the CustomDbSession class for?
[27.12.21 17:11:51] elliott: in short
[27.12.21 17:12:01] elliott: I made it to pass the parameter
[27.12.21 17:12:07] elliott: but I probably can't explain the magic
[27.12.21 17:12:31] elliott: there are five records in the database for two queries
[27.12.21 17:12:35] elliott: but the parameter is passed

[27.12.21 17:15:24] elliott: that is, the first query creates two service records and a third Honeypot record, for example, if Honeypot is selected by the command for the beam. Then you click ok in the modal, and the database fucking disappears the Honeypot entry, but three new session entries appear with the same service id
[27.12.21 17:15:37] elliott: And there's a parameter in the code. What's the big deal?
[27.12.21 17:15:50] elliott: and of course the fucking database clears itself, I give you that

[20.01.22 09:04:26] elliott: I downloaded the git and the base from 65 yesterday, but it does not work

[21.01.22 08:34:53] elliott: if you remove this everything else goes up?
[21.01.22 08:41:24] alphonse: put stubs and comments where it doesn't work

[21.01.22 08:59:33] alphonse: you have to make it write
[21.01.22 09:00:25] alphonse: something like Extension Système de Microsoft Money is supposedly not written
[21.01.22 09:00:55] alphonse: Extension Syst? me de Microsoft Money = make it so, that's all
[21.01.22 10:20:23] elliott: I think I got the point.
[21.01.22 10:22:31] alphonse: download answer to text file and make some test mode for proto2 to suck from file. there will be base bump in some place

[28.01.22 14:10:09] elliott: so before you yell, did you try reading?
[28.01.22 14:10:24] elliott: ``
Case2:
(all in the same group).
1) create prefix1 through the admin
2) create prefix2 through admin
3) update prefix1 through the admin panel - it will update correctly
4) Updating prefix2 through admin - this will update prefix1, changing the value of the "URI prefix" to a value from prefix2.
```
[28.01.22 14:10:30] elliott: nothing about api
[28.01.22 14:10:58] elliott: I, for example, can't create anything at all in the group, all the time it says that the prefix is incorrect

[03.02.22 15:53:26] alphonse: this is what's going on at the kolyan's
[03.02.22 15:53:45] alphonse: I can't get it right
[03.02.22 15:55:39] alphonse: when he refreshes the page at 0:031 - at 0:38 the checkboxes are ticked
[03.02.22 15:55:46] alphonse: it shouldn't be
[03.02.22 15:55:50] alphonse: I don't have any
[03.02.22 15:56:06] alphonse: and I can not get it on Linux or on Windows
[03.02.22 15:56:25] alphonse: try again
[03.02.22 15:56:35] alphonse: will you or not
[03.02.22 16:23:27] elliott: read general chat at night?
[03.02.22 16:24:17] alphonse: no
[03.02.22 16:24:28] alphonse: I was sleeping)
[03.02.22 16:24:48] alphonse: why?
[03.02.22 16:25:08] elliott: it's fucked up
[03 02/222 16:25:25] alphonse: what?
[03.02.22 16:26:00] elliott: https://www.wired.com/story/trickbot-malware-group-internal-messages/
[03.02.22 16:26:08] elliott: read the whole thing, I had a panic attack this morning...
[03.02.22 16:27:32] elliott: I don't know why the fuck they publish this, letting you know what and how the investigation goes, but you can't fucking write this off as fantasy or paranoia
[03.02.22 16:46:01] elliott: judging by the vid, the ticks are written into the session by indexes in the table, so they apply after the page reload
[03.02.22 16:47:54]
[03.02.22 16:48:18] alphonse: You didn't guess that some of our bosses wear GRU shoulder straps?))
[03.02.22 16:48:22] elliott: No.
[03.02.22 16:48:28] elliott: I don't really believe it.
[03.02.22 16:49:00] alphonse: at least 2
[03.02.22 16:49:13] elliott: of course there was an idea that someone is sitting there by the form, but it looks more like sweet dreams, or the left business of someone there, who will leak us if necessary and all
[03.02.22 16:49:34] elliott: again, did you notice, the year 15 is the one mentioned when everything went fucked up. The americans write, it was an arrest.
[03.02.22 16:50:17] alphonse: we're having some kind of reorganization right now
[03.02.22 16:50:20] elliott: the planted chick is the one they took by email in hosting
[03.02.22 16:50:24] elliott: and some dick Lithuanian
[03.02.22 16:50:40] elliott: maybe it was the guy who disappeared, remember?
[03.02.22 16:51:10] elliott: even if Medvedev is personally the boss, it doesn't help us
[03.02.22 16:51:24] alphonse: sausage already appeared in '16
[03.02.22 16:51:40] elliott: I don't remember what year it was, but it disappeared, and now they write that they took the baba
[03.02.22 16:51:43] elliott: coincidence?
[03.02.22 16:52:11] alphonse: they took not a sausage, but Max AllaWitte - web-broder
[03.02.22 16:52:14] elliott: hacked and read all the fucking correspondence in toad
[03.02.22 16:52:33] elliott: So somehow they found it, dug it up, collected it and decrypted it
[03.02.22 16:52:43] elliott: that's you and all the fucking encryption
[03.02.22 16:52:45] alphonse: the sausage was a tester. she's the wife or broad of someone earlier
[03.02.22 16:53:31] elliott: and when I read there about some vladimir, I thought they've already found you)
[03.02.22 16:53:56] elliott: judging by the article, Stern doesn't care much about correspondence either
[03.02.22 16:54:01] alphonse: did i ever tell you my name?)
[03.02.22 16:54:12] elliott: easy to find who's the boss, who are the leaders, who does what
[03.02.22 16:54:18] elliott: you once sent me an email, it said vlad
[03.02.22 16:54:22] elliott: never mind your name
[03.02.22 16:54:53] elliott: these assholes don't close cases and have no statute of limitations
[03.02.22 16:55:12] elliott: such proceedings in america are always open. And I also don't understand why the fuck they should attack hospitals
[03.02.22 16:55:15] elliott: if they're not lying
[03.02.22 16:55:47] elliott: and ours, if you know Pavlovic's history, gives out great
[03.02.22 16:56:18] alphonse: something strange... there has always been talk about leaving government agencies untouched. only commerce
[03.02.22 16:56:47] elliott: They were. Maybe they are taking the piss, it's a fashion to put a Russian mark everywhere, I don't fucking know.
[03.02.22 16:57:19] elliott: The toad was our office one, so was the vpn. All the connections are through tor and ipn. How did you compile the correspondence archive?
[03.02.22 16:57:28] elliott: Rhetorical question
[03.02.22 16:58:19] alphonse: took alla, got access to the computer. got access to the toad.
[03.02.22 16:58:36] elliott: and especially the stern correspondence, yeah.
[03.02.22 16:58:56] alphonse: stern never even turned on the toad
[03.02.22 16:59:34] elliott: they probably won't give him away either. Even the number of people and country is calculated
[03.02.22 16:59:42] elliott: And you're there, if you noticed
[03.02.22 17:00:10]
[03.02.22 17:00:13] elliott: Spalen hof and someone else from Belarus, as written. I don't know, but you might have popped up as a figurehead in conversations
[03.02.22 17:00:42] elliott: August 20, I was out of business if I recall, and didn't talk to anyone at all
[03.02.22 17:01:01] elliott: really, i don't remember exactly what time it was...
[03.02.22 17:02:13] alphonse: how do you know that there were only 4 people from rb?
[03.02.22 17:02:20] elliott: I don't know at all
[03.02.22 17:02:23] elliott: I thought there were three
[03.02.22 17:02:34] alphonse: maybe there's 30 of us
[03.02.22 17:02:54] elliott: Well, you're thinking of something bad.
[03.02.22 17:03:35] elliott: it's not hard to find, once a test server is lit, remember, how did hosters crash our servers?
[03.02.22 17:03:38] alphonse: short: what happens when you try to repeat Kolyan's actions?
[03.02.22 17:03:49] elliott: and he sends you files to upload them and they come to you
[03.02.22 17:04:25] alphonse: 2 vpn from me to 65
[03.02.22 17:04:34] alphonse: one in the other
[03.02.22 17:04:41] elliott: these guys don't give a fuck
[03.02.22 17:04:46] elliott: mars seems to be double
[03.02.22 17:04:52] elliott: but i wouldn't get my hopes up
[03.02.22 17:05:30] alphonse: they are all double. i also have a public one on my host machine
[03.02.22 17:05:31] elliott: The table does not exist: audit
[03.02.22 17:05:50] alphonse: yes on 65

[03.02.22 17:06:36] alphonse: erasing?
[03.02.22 17:06:39] elliott: 65 fuck you, you're climbing combat
[03.02.22 17:06:53] elliott: erase
[03.02.22 17:08:49] elliott: what kind of commands was he picking?
[03.02.22 17:09:10] alphonse: did you download the video?
[03.02.22 17:09:16] alphonse: kolyana
[03.02.22 17:09:19] elliott: downloaded it and didn't pay attention
[03.02.22 17:09:26] elliott: looked at the checkmarks
[03.02.22 17:09:31]
[03.02.22 17:09:37] elliott: I already deleted the video
[03.02.22 17:10:30] alphonse: actions: bot-mark checkbox-set hanipot-go-refresh page.
[03.02.22 17:12:47] elliott: repeated in Mozilla
[03.02.22 17:13:41] alphonse: that's fucked up))) i can't reproduce it in mine
[03.02.22 17:14:37] elliott: well, it would be fuckin' great to have a local
[03.02.22 17:16:17] elliott: i thought i removed the audit and the file from the footer
[04.02.22 17:53:31] alphonse: koo
[07.02.22 08:27:46] alphonse: koo
[07.02.22 08:28:19] alphonse: your tasking is 844. there's a wind torus layout
[08.02.22 08:51:35] alphonse: koo
[08.02.22 08:51:44] alphonse: otr
[08.02.22 08:53:29] elliott: repeat
[08.02.22 08:53:42] alphonse: koo
[08.02.22 08:53:45] alphonse: your tasking is 844. there's a windup to tor
[08.02.22 08:53:58] alphonse: i don't have wind and torus)))
[08.02.22 08:54:08] alphonse: windup
[08.02.22 08:54:09] elliott: yeah, me neither
[08.02.22 08:54:36] alphonse: you live in the windup. no?
[08.02.22 08:54:54] elliott: yes, but I won't take anything out there
[08.02.22 08:56:51] alphonse: well, then fuck around with a smart look and tell Kolyan that tor is crap. He doesn't understand fixed width div.
[08.02.22 08:58:23] elliott: we'll see.
[10.02.22 15:55:35] elliott: short
[10.02.22 15:55:39] elliott: ps
[10.02.22 15:56:11] elliott: I have no solution, the bug appears not only in tor-browser, but also in simple FF
[10.02.22 15:56:30] elliott: the table size really fucks up, it really doesn't fit in the screen and resize really doesn't work
[10.02.22 15:56:46] elliott: and none of my attempts to do anything about it were successful
[10.02.22 15:57:05] elliott: According to the manual from the widget everything is fine, but shit doesn't work. There is an opinion that something is broken, but what - I do not understand.
[10.02.22 15:57:10] elliott: is there any point in fucking around further?
[10.02.22 15:57:33] elliott: and do you know what elroy wanted?
[10.02.22 15:58:35] alphonse: wanted to ask what exactly you're doing
[10.02.22 15:58:43] elliott: why the fuck would he?
[10.02.22 15:59:11] alphonse: and he's in charge now
[10.02.22 15:59:22] elliott: oh my god, is sylver all?
[10.02.22 15:59:28] alphonse: ah
[10.02.22 15:59:30] alphonse: yes
[10.02.22 16:00:56] elliott: we should jump ship
[10.02.22 16:01:14] elliott: Since captain silver's gone...
[10.02.22 16:03:20] elliott: it's not the builder that messes up, it's the table itself with the bots
[10.02.22 16:24:34] elliott: I was wondering what you came up with there?
[10.02.22 16:25:24] alphonse: removed the fix width
[10.02.22 16:30:08] elliott: the width was automatically drawn by the plugin
[10.02.22 16:31:15] elliott: Fixed width by columns only
[10.02.22 16:31:20] elliott: and the table is automatically drawn
[17.02.22 13:32:20] alphonse: ku
[17.02.22 13:32:29] elliott: ps
[17.02.22 13:38:00] alphonse: 839-842 your favorite section of the group
[17.02.22 13:40:57] elliott: ok
[17.02.22 13:41:05] elliott: nothing went down in the gita
[17.02.22 13:41:08] elliott: is this right?
[17.02.22 13:41:22]
[17.02.22 13:42:26] alphonse: fire away
[17.02.22 13:42:51] elliott: Check.
[17.02.22 19:48:10] alphonse: Fuck!
[17.02.22 19:49:11] alphonse: I fucked up the _loadertool.php file and uploaded it to the git
[17.02.22 19:49:31] alphonse: roll it back and save it before it works
[18.02.22 10:07:53] elliott: I pumped the pool, file is not gone
[18.02.22 10:08:24] elliott: The table does not exist: audit
[18.02.22 10:08:30] elliott: when will this shit disappear?)
[18.02.22 10:10:31] elliott: Um, I hesitate to ask, where did all prefix form from group strings go?
[18.02.22 10:12:13] elliott: that's "fucked up"?)
[18.02.22 10:12:34] elliott: I found the last whole version from the file history, I hope there were no global changes
[18.02.22 10:33:25] alphonse: yes. i talked to kolyan and decided to make one section instead of 4, adding a dropdown of the file's purpose. if you want, you can implement it
[18.02.22 12:30:06] alphonse: well, it is))) i fucked up in such a way: i started to do as i wanted, then i reloaded linux (i lost the changes) and safely forgot since i fucked up my brain with something else. and in the end i fucked up
[18.02.22 13:46:36] elliott: okay
[02/18/222 13:46:54] elliott: Now I opened a channel and I have a question. How do we send him the manual and the distributive of the admin?
[18.02.22 13:47:10] elliott: I don't give a fuck about the manual, but where can I get the distribution package?
[18.02.22 13:48:10] elliott: of the distributions I think rocco will find somewhere on the server the installer from the time of king arthur last year, and I can't even properly assemble anything, because I'm not sure that my code is fully operational
[18.02.22 14:04:05] alphonse: you did deb. or is he fucked?
[18.02.22 14:06:47] elliott: there's some in the git
[18.02.22 14:06:50] elliott: if it fits
[18.02.22 14:07:03] elliott: but otherwise I don't know, maybe I should have some fuckin' thing in the git and put it there so I wouldn't fuck it up
[18.02.22 16:03:21] elliott: 839 is a fucking pain in the ass
[18.02.22 16:03:43] elliott: And the rest
[18.02.22 16:03:50] elliott: I don't even know if you can do anything there
[18.02.22 16:03:56] elliott: one thing's connected to the other and there's fucked up
[18.02.22 16:04:57] elliott: validations from the server, time of their arrival is unknown, empty fields are not validated, check by submit - and what to check, the whole form at once? well, fuck... i don't know
[18.02.22 16:05:13] elliott: all these widgets and other shit is fucked up
[21.02.22 10:06:22] elliott: gc
[21.02.22 10:06:29] alphonse: koo
[21.02.22 10:06:45] elliott: did you read on Friday I wrote about the validacyme shit?
[21.02.22 10:06:55] alphonse: no
[21.02.22 10:06:56] elliott: there's a real pain in the ass
[21.02.22 10:07:15] elliott: these shuffles are all about one thing - validation of the new prefix form, but to do it...
[21.02.22 10:07:35] alphonse: see
[21.02.22 10:07:51] alphonse: I've been racking my brain for a couple of days
[21.02.22 10:07:56] elliott: okay.
[21.02.22 10:07:56] alphonse: the strategy is this:
[21.02.22 10:09:16] alphonse: 1) basic - grid with "files" table
[21.02.22 10:09:54] alphonse: 2) advance with writing options like cookies and bat file
[21.02.22 10:10:18] alphonse: 3) all criates / edits in modal windows
[21.02.22 10:10:41] alphonse: this will simplify the validations because it will be put into separate forms
[21.02.22 10:10:41] elliott: there are no modal windows
[21.02.22 10:10:50] alphonse: let's do it that way)
[21.02.22 10:11:03] alphonse: there is no fucking hat
[21.02.22 10:11:03] elliott: you mean you want to redo the whole group?
[21.02.22 10:11:09] alphonse: yes
[21.02.22 10:11:28] alphonse: in the iodal window one set
[21.02.22 10:11:33] elliott: well fuck knows, it was a thought too, but then ideally we should give up all these grid plugins
[21.02.22 10:11:40] alphonse: + dropdown destination
[21.02.22 10:11:48] elliott: because with them I don't know how to properly validate it all
[21.02.22 10:11:49] alphonse: no
[21.02.22 10:11:55] alphonse: nothing without grids
[21.02.22 10:12:29] elliott: then what's the plan?
[21.02.22 10:13:30] alphonse: stated above with figures
[21.02.22 14:15:45] elliott: Well.
[21.02.22 14:15:50] elliott: fuck plans?)
[21.02.22 14:17:25] alphonse: let's take a break)))
[21.02.22 14:17:33] alphonse: naka in november of '15
