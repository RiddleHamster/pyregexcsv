[02.08.21 13:07:27] elliott: would you check on the gaskets?
[02.08.21 13:11:44] elliott: see what's up with the pads?
[02.08.21 13:13:19] elliott: in the band sylver wrote, old proto2
[02.08.21 13:13:28] elliott: says it's dead
[02.08.21 13:40:39] elliott: what's up? all dead?
[02.08.21 13:41:13] elliott: please tell sylver in the group
[03.08.21 16:48:16] elliott: tell me what they mean by basic new admin, 159?
[03.08.21 17:00:46] elliott: do you know how to make a connection in ms via shell link so that you can connect via tor?
[03.08.21 17:00:56] elliott: i'd upload the fucking clock, but i don't want to go there directly
[03.08.21 17:03:00] elliott: Or maybe there's some other way to upload files?
[03.08.21 17:06:33] elliott: what do you use?
[17.09.21 11:01:36] elliott: Hello.
[17.09.21 11:03:06] elliott: there's a little problem on the 65 server
[17.09.21 11:03:17] elliott: can't write a folder
[17.09.21 11:03:18] rocco: hi
[17.09.21 11:03:34] elliott: /var/www/html/advanced-project/filesStorage
[17.09.21 11:03:46] elliott: alf must have installed a root admin and pxp is fucked as a result
[17.09.21 11:03:51] elliott: I was just poking and poking and fucking swimming
[17.09.21 11:03:58] elliott: i can only go in every single folder
[17.09.21 11:04:11] elliott: could you put 777 on it all together?
[17.09.21 11:04:30] elliott: it's so fucking annoying that the files aren't uploaded
[17.09.21 11:05:16] rocco: this one?
/var/www/html/advanced-project/filesStorage
[17.09.21 11:05:24] elliott: yes
[17.09.21 11:05:36] elliott: so everyone inside has rights, and new folders are created with rights too
[17.09.21 11:05:56] elliott: every new user gets all rights except "write to all" and that's the one that's missing the checkbox
[17.09.21 11:06:12] elliott: the user in the admin I mean. everyone has his own folder
[17.09.21 11:07:07] rocco: sec
[17.09.21 11:08:15] rocco: try it
[17.09.21 11:08:24] elliott: I won't try, I only have my account
[17.09.21 11:08:35] elliott: no rights
[17.09.21 11:08:40] elliott: viewer
[17.09.21 11:08:43] elliott: hold on, I'll update
[17.09.21 11:09:08] elliott: no, no, I clicked on random folder and it's not checked anyway
[17.09.21 11:09:19] elliott: inside where the number folders are
[17.09.21 11:09:27] elliott: all must have 777

[17.09.21 11:10:57] elliott: and yesterday i couldn't do anything either
[17.09.21 11:11:06] elliott: I had to poke everyone

[27.10.21 13:50:00] elliott: Check it up.
[27.10.21 13:51:59] elliott: There's another problem.
[27.10.21 13:52:12] elliott: I installed it under root, which, as you remember, you can't do
[27.10.21 13:52:20] elliott: that's why i'm gonna take it down and need a user
[27.10.21 13:53:25] elliott: there will be problems under root and in addition there is no crontab
[27.10.21 13:53:50] elliott: plus ports are not open, no access, my installer doesn't manage ports
[27.10.21 13:54:06] elliott: let's create a user, open port 443 and try to install from courts
[27.10.21 13:54:08] elliott: ok?
[27.10.21 13:54:39] elliott: well, or give me a command, I'll put it in to open the ports myself
[27.10.21 13:55:13] elliott: koo?
[27.10.21 13:58:35] rocco: yeah yeah
[27.10.21 13:59:07] elliott: will sudo ufw allow 443/tcp work?
[27.10.21 14:00:11] rocco: let me check it
[27.10.21 14:00:21] elliott: it's always the same on the new ones
[27.10.21 14:00:29] elliott: you set it up and you can't fucking get through
[27.10.21 14:00:32] rocco: try it
[27.10.21 14:00:37] elliott: i took it down
[27.10.21 14:00:43] elliott: you must install from sudo user
[27.10.21 14:00:54] rocco: it fucking froze!
[27.10.21 14:00:58] elliott: I tried just to test the new package after all modifications not to crash
[27.10.21 14:01:10] elliott: but it shouldn't be started by root, there is no crontab
[27.10.21 14:01:19] elliott: you need a crontab there
[27.10.21 14:02:34] rocco: can you reboot?
[27.10.21 14:02:49] elliott: how?
[27.10.21 14:02:52] elliott: I only have ssx
[27.10.21 14:02:54] rocco: I erased all the rules there for some fucking reason
[27.10.21 14:02:59] elliott: )))
[27.10.21 14:02:59] rocco: reboot
[27.10.21 14:03:04] elliott: you had no fucking business
[27.10.21 14:03:18] rocco: they're fucking with the rules
[27.10.21 14:03:20] elliott: i understand the reboot, but i can't access it either
[27.10.21 14:03:41] rocco: now reboot from the panel
[27.10.21 14:03:46] elliott: yeah
[27.10.21 14:04:37] elliott: this is a common problem, that's why I would like to make a rule in the installer, so that every time, especially a new person, didn't sit half a day cramming why the fuck everything is installed, but nothing opens
[27.10.21 14:05:09] rocco: i rushed to erase, maybe ufw was there by default
[27.10.21 14:05:18] rocco: you could have just turned it off
[27.10.21 14:05:35] elliott: well, for me it was always enough something like sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
[27.10.21 14:06:13] elliott: iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
[27.10.21 14:06:16] elliott: Or this
[27.10.21 14:06:38] elliott: I can fuck them both up, let them run
[27.10.21 14:06:42] rocco: yeah.
[27.10.21 14:06:43] elliott: It can't hurt.
[27.10.21 14:06:54] rocco: all rebooted
[27.10.21 14:07:02] elliott: I just don't understand, why the fuck to close port 80 or 443?
[27.10.21 14:07:04] rocco: turn on iptablesom
[27.10.21 14:07:07] elliott: what do they think servers are for?
[27.10.21 14:07:25] rocco: so there would be no input through the tether, U only from torus
[27.10.21 14:07:38] elliott: is it such a hosting, directly under tor?
[27.10.21 14:07:39] rocco: ah you mean hoster
[27.10.21 14:08:01] elliott: very often such a fuck-up on new servers
[27.10.21 14:08:02] rocco: no, this hoster shuts everything down, i don't know why
[27.10.21 14:08:20] elliott: ditto. i added iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
[27.10.21 14:08:24] elliott: make a user
[27.10.21 14:08:32] rocco: ok
[27.10.21 14:08:38] rocco: with sudo?
[27.10.21 14:08:44] elliott: yeah, sure.
[27.10.21 14:08:48] elliott: without sudo, he's fucking useless.
[27.10.21 14:10:30] elliott: i got the package in the tmp
[27.10.21 14:10:51] elliott: you want to try it yourself, but from a user with sudo, not from any root
