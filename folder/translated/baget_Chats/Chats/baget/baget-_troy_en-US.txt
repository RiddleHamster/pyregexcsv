My dear friends!
I congratulate you with great delight on the Great Victory Day.
On this day we crushed not the fascist evil, on this day we put the devil to shame!
On May 9th, let each one of you remember that on that day, with the strength and honor of the Soviet people, the worst plague, the plague of hatred, the plague of discord, the plague of imaginary superiority, was cast into hell. Honor and praise to the true warriors of light! Warriors who are the victors of the devil himself!
Hurrah, brothers and sisters! Happy Holidays!!!!
