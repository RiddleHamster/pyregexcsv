Either.

2020-07-08T15:52:25 kevin -> baget
anything

2020-07-08T15:52:26 kevin -> baget
?

2020-07-08T15:52:50 baget -> kevin
Well, either work from scratch on DFS or have something.

2020-07-08-08T15:52:54 baget -> kevin
What are you talking about?

2020-07-08-08T15:53:36 kevin -> baget
no. I get it.

2020-07-08T15:53:56 kevin -> baget
just what does a server with DAV and a DFS from scratch have to do with it?

2020-07-08-08T15:54:11 baget -> kevin
Cut.

2020-07-08-08T15:54:31 baget -> kevin
A serverac with a DAV is one thing.

2020-07-08-08T15:54:41 baget -> kevin
Not really a big deal.

2020-07-08T15:54:47 kevin -> baget
Well, that's what I mean.

2020-07-08T15:57:01 kevin -> baget
then)

2020-07-08-08T15:57:05 baget -> kevin
That's what I figured.

2020-07-08-08T15:57:18 baget -> kevin
Sorry for the intrusive reminder.

2020-07-08T15:57:26 kevin -> baget
No. It's good to be reminded.

2020-07-08T15:57:28 kevin -> baget
conversely

2020-07-08T15:57:31 kevin -> baget
slipped my mind.

2020-07-08T15:57:41 baget -> kevin
Is there hope there, or are we not leaning on it?

2020-07-08-08T15:57:51 baget -> kevin
Really important.

2020-07-08-08T15:58:06 baget -> kevin
My schedule for the month ahead depends on it.

2020-07-08T15:58:18 kevin -> baget
wow

2020-07-08-08T15:58:35 baget -> kevin
DFS is the problem.

2020-07-08T15:58:49 baget -> kevin
It can't be done in two days.

2020-07-08-08T15:58:59 baget -> kevin
I told you before...

2020-07-08T15:59:05 kevin -> baget
Yeah. I get it.

2020-07-08T16:00:02 baget -> kevin
I need to know. You know, I'll have to settle the schedule with my superiors :-)

2020-07-08T16:00:17 baget -> kevin
Well, or you won't have to.

2020-07-08T16:00:20 kevin -> baget
I get it. I'll try to work it out.

2020-07-08T16:00:29 baget -> kevin
Thanks, buddy.

2020-07-08T16:00:35 baget -> kevin
I'm sorry for pulling the plug.

2020-07-08T16:00:35 kevin -> baget
how much we need DFS at all. how critical is it.

2020-07-08T16:00:56 baget -> kevin
How should I know?

2020-07-08T16:01:07 kevin -> baget
that's what we're trying to find out.

2020-07-08-08T16:01:09 kevin -> baget
I mean it

2020-07-08T16:01:13 baget -> kevin
That's your claim!:-)

2020-07-08T16:01:14 kevin -> baget
what regulation

2020-07-08T16:01:18 kevin -> baget
make up my mind.

2020-07-08T16:01:39 baget -> kevin
I'm working on the DAV for now, but it's not very complicated.

2020-07-08T16:01:52 kevin -> baget
Whether or not you can do without it is the main question.

2020-07-08T16:01:57 kevin -> baget
that's what we'll find out.

2020-07-08T16:02:00 kevin -> baget
that's all for now)

2020-07-08T16:02:13 baget -> kevin
It depends on where the product is being sent.
