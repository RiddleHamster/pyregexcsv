What does def want from me?

2020-06-22T17:40:53 hof -> baget

2020-06-22T17:41:03 baget -> hof
<defender> any other toad you can contact me by

2020-06-22T17:41:35 baget -> hof
I'm ashamed, but I don't know how...

2020-06-22T17:41:48 baget -> hof
I don't do that kind of stuff.

2020-06-22T17:42:15 baget -> hof
Only quietly...

2020-06-22T17:42:20 baget -> hof
I'm embarrassed.

2020-06-22T17:42:23 hof -> baget
you need to make a toad, settings - accounts - new

2020-06-22T17:42:36 baget -> hof
Another one.

2020-06-22T17:42:40 hof -> baget
Type xmpp.jp there

2020-06-22T17:42:53 hof -> baget
psi you have, right?

2020-06-22T17:42:54 baget -> hof
Hof, dear.

2020-06-22T17:43:05 baget -> hof
I don't understand you either.

2020-06-22T17:43:20 hof -> baget
Well, this is the program we use to communicate with you

2020-06-22T17:43:28 hof -> baget
it's called a toad

2020-06-22T17:43:33 hof -> baget
psi+

2020-06-22T17:43:34 baget -> hof
Psi+

2020-06-22T17:44:22 hof -> baget
I don't remember how to do it correctly anymore.

2020-06-22T17:44:27 baget -> hof
+79780446763. That's if I do something wrong.

2020-06-22T17:44:44 baget -> hof
Pass it on to Def:-)

2020-06-22T17:44:48 hof -> baget
ok, but don't give it away to anyone

2020-06-22T17:45:03 baget -> hof
That wasn't even given to Def.

2020-06-22T17:45:15 baget -> hof
did not report.

Bingo!

On the contrary, batono is very honorable.

2020-06-22T17:48:38 hof -> baget
I haven't logged in for a long time myself.

Yes!

Well, there's an add

А!

2020-06-22T17:53:37 baget -> hof
Thank you!

2020-06-22T17:53:39 baget -> hof
Right!

2020-06-22T17:54:00 hof -> baget
fields will appear, type in batono@xmpp.jp

2020-06-22T17:54:18 hof -> baget
And there will probably be a pass

2020-06-22T17:54:23 hof -> baget
enter the passkey at once, too.

2020-06-22T17:54:32 baget -> hof
I'm not that dumb...

2020-06-22T17:54:40 hof -> baget
I don't remember it myself.

2020-06-22T17:54:48 hof -> baget
and not in front of my eyes.

2020-06-22T17:55:09 baget -> hof
Right.

2020-06-22T17:55:14 baget -> hof
Eaten.

2020-06-22T17:55:16 baget -> hof
И?

2020-06-22T17:55:19 hof -> baget
great

2020-06-22T17:55:36 hof -> baget
where the contacts appeared batono ?

2020-06-22T17:55:48 hof -> baget
right click - available

2020-06-22T17:55:54 baget -> hof
Yes. In a separate group.

2020-06-22T17:56:03 hof -> baget
And wait for it to turn yellow.

2020-06-22T17:56:13 hof -> baget
became?

2020-06-22T17:57:25 hof -> baget
connected?

2020-06-22T17:57:30 baget -> hof
No

2020-06-22T17:57:40 hof -> baget
What's going on?

2020-06-22T17:57:58 baget -> hof
Nothing...

2020-06-22T17:58:10 baget -> hof
There's no console here?

2020-06-22T17:58:30 hof -> baget
right-click on the connection name above the batono

2020-06-22T17:58:46 baget -> hof
Ah, ...Nad...

2020-06-22T17:59:08 hof -> baget
Yes and select status - available

2020-06-22T17:59:40 baget -> hof
Holy shit, who came up with such a friendly interface?

2020-06-22T17:59:48 baget -> hof
Yes, it worked!

2020-06-22T17:59:57 baget -> hof
Low bow!!!

2020-06-22T18:00:10 hof -> baget
is gulliver knocking on your door?

2020-06-22T18:00:21 baget -> hof
Yes.

2020-06-22T18:00:25 hof -> baget
it's me

2020-06-22T18:00:35 baget -> hof
Added

2020-06-29T19:17:55 baget -> hof
Hi!

2020-06-29T19:19:59 hof -> baget
hi

2020-06-29T19:20:13 baget -> hof
Are you awake?

2020-06-29T19:20:25 hof -> baget
soon to be in the hooch.

2020-06-29T19:20:28 baget -> hof
Didn't wake you up?

2020-06-29T19:20:32 hof -> baget
no )

2020-06-29T19:20:47 baget -> hof
Thank God.

2020-06-29T19:20:59 baget -> hof
I'm just saying. Just chatting.

2020-06-29T19:21:05 hof -> baget
how's it going?

2020-06-29T19:21:18 hof -> baget
did it work with the processes?

2020-06-29T19:21:22 baget -> hof
Here's why

2020-06-29T19:21:29 baget -> hof
Oh, that's a giveaway.

2020-06-29T19:21:32 baget -> hof
Right.

2020-06-29T19:22:01 hof -> baget
Are the results normal? Did the antiviruses fall off?

2020-06-29T19:22:14 baget -> hof
By the way, if you don't take into account the speed of the workout, it's a fairy tale.

2020-06-29T19:22:26 hof -> baget
well done

2020-06-29T19:22:53 baget -> hof
But, it's definitely not real-time technology.

2020-06-29T19:23:02 baget -> hof
:-)

2020-06-29T19:23:07 hof -> baget
)

2020-06-29T19:23:10 hof -> baget
ybxtuj

2020-06-29T19:23:23 hof -> baget
Nothing, you don't need to do it in realtime.

2020-06-29T19:24:01 baget -> hof
For the interprocess exchange, I took WinEvent's.

2020-06-29T19:24:18 baget -> hof
Great work.

2020-06-29T19:24:36 hof -> baget
and read via ReadProcessMemory ?

2020-06-29T19:24:49 baget -> hof
No, no, no, no, no!

2020-06-29T19:25:02 baget -> hof
It's a shit sight.

2020-06-29T19:25:07 hof -> baget
)

2020-06-29T19:25:19 baget -> hof
No, of course not.

2020-06-29T19:25:21 hof -> baget
shared memory

2020-06-29T19:25:40 baget -> hof
That's a great idea. Thought.

2020-06-29T19:25:59 baget -> hof
But, also declined.

2020-06-29T19:26:20 baget -> hof
You'd have to do a proxy dll, and that's not good either.

2020-06-29T19:26:36 baget -> hof
You'll never guess. :-D

2020-06-29T19:26:56 hof -> baget
come on )

2020-06-29T19:26:59 baget -> hof
I took a DDE to try it out.

2020-06-29T19:27:19 baget -> hof
Man, it's slow, but it works!

2020-06-29T19:27:41 baget -> hof
This crap hasn't been used in 10 years!

2020-06-29T19:27:47 baget -> hof
And she is!

2020-06-29T19:28:14 hof -> baget
wow

2020-06-29T19:28:20 baget -> hof
Meaning?

2020-06-29T19:28:58 baget -> hof
There's nothing like that there.

2020-06-29T19:29:11 baget -> hof
That was a great mechanism.

2020-06-29T19:29:19 hof -> baget
Well done for remembering him.

2020-06-29T19:30:30 baget -> hof
Well, I used to write some MFC code while working for Microsoft, and that stuff was very widely exploited there.

2020-06-29T19:30:54 baget -> hof
Really, I was sure it had been crossed off.

2020-06-29T19:31:07 baget -> hof
Turns out not!:-)

2020-06-29T19:31:17 hof -> baget
they are reluctant to cross something off, there is a lot of ready-made software

2020-06-29T19:31:34 hof -> baget
Well, that's great.

2020-06-29T19:31:56 baget -> hof
I really want to do an LPC run.

2020-06-29T19:32:18 baget -> hof
But, this is closer to academic research.

2020-06-29T19:32:30 baget -> hof
I don't think it's going to do any good.

2020-06-29T19:32:53 hof -> baget
Did you check the dynamics?

2020-06-29T19:33:01 hof -> baget
on dincheck

2020-06-29T19:33:16 baget -> hof
Well, how do you check it?

2020-06-29T19:33:38 hof -> baget
script and run

2020-06-29T19:33:45 baget -> hof
Your module is cut into a dozen tasks.

2020-06-29T19:33:58 baget -> hof
All encrypted

2020-06-29T19:34:17 baget -> hof
I didn't bother as much as I packed the ress...

2020-06-29T19:34:55 baget -> hof
I scattered it at my place, it whistled.

2020-06-29T19:35:21 hof -> baget
resources are fine, but again, the main thing is not to sting

2020-06-29T19:35:22 baget -> hof
Except that it's slow sometimes.

2020-06-29T19:35:36 baget -> hof
Nah, they don't grab at all.

2020-06-29T19:36:23 baget -> hof
You can enter a bunch of processes, not just one.

2020-06-29T19:36:53 baget -> hof
I was afraid that was the only thing that would cause a trigger.

2020-06-29T19:37:03 baget -> hof
It didn't.

2020-06-29T19:37:24 hof -> baget
What avs did you check for? if without dincheck

2020-06-29T19:37:43 baget -> hof
On McAffee.

2020-06-29T19:37:53 baget -> hof
License.

2020-06-29T19:38:12 baget -> hof
With paranoid settings.

2020-06-29T19:38:39 baget -> hof
Well, and def, of course...

2020-06-29T19:39:01 baget -> hof
My def backdoor got slaughtered today...:-)

2020-06-29T19:39:38 baget -> hof
Let it go on the build - here you go. Very dangerous software.

2020-06-29T19:39:39 hof -> baget
What's the detection?

2020-06-29T19:39:47 baget -> hof
Trojan.

2020-06-29T19:40:23 hof -> baget
you know defender has a very good emulator, right?

2020-06-29T19:40:24 baget -> hof
Well, and letters and numbers.

2020-06-29T19:40:31 baget -> hof
No...

2020-06-29T19:40:41 baget -> hof
I'm just being facetious.

2020-06-29T19:40:48 hof -> baget
he may have gotten to the code to download and run the file

2020-06-29T19:41:03 hof -> baget
And this is a trojan.

2020-06-29T19:41:25 baget -> hof
Nope, no way:-)

2020-06-29T19:41:36 baget -> hof
He was swearing at the lines...

2020-06-29T19:41:57 hof -> baget
lines must be encrypted

2020-06-29T19:42:04 baget -> hof
I put them through the stack and it was over.

2020-06-29T19:42:18 baget -> hof
Well, yeah. I did that too.

2020-06-29T19:42:42 baget -> hof
And I was swearing at the cmd.exe segment!

2020-06-29T19:43:54 hof -> baget
Did you run it through cmd.exe?

2020-06-29T19:44:04 baget -> hof
Right.

2020-06-29T19:44:07 hof -> baget
console?

2020-06-29T19:44:18 hof -> baget
Why not directly?

2020-06-29T19:44:21 baget -> hof
cmd?

2020-06-29T19:44:31 baget -> hof
Yes, the console...

2020-06-29T19:44:34 baget -> hof
А!

2020-06-29T19:45:20 baget -> hof
I wanted to run one thing, so I got lazy and called it through system(...)

2020-06-29T19:46:01 baget -> hof
For nothing.

2020-06-29T19:46:27 hof -> baget
Yes, it is better to use CreateProcess

2020-06-29T19:46:49 hof -> baget
although ShellExecute is also possible

2020-06-29T19:46:53 baget -> hof
Well, that's understandable:-)

2020-06-29T19:47:17 baget -> hof
There's just less writing through the system...

2020-06-29T19:47:28 hof -> baget
)

2020-06-29T19:47:52 baget -> hof
Yes, yes, yes. lazy...

2020-06-29T19:48:24 hof -> baget
I'm lazy too, the weather is nice, I don't work (

2020-06-29T19:48:42 hof -> baget
you're forcing yourself

2020-06-29T19:50:06 hof -> baget
Okay, I'm going to bed, and I wish you the same

2020-06-29T19:50:12 baget -> hof
Exactly!

2020-06-29T19:50:20 baget -> hof
Oh, yeah. Me too.

You okay, how are you? Is it hot in here?

2020-07-14T16:30:09 baget -> hof
Nah, we're fucked! :-D

2020-07-14T16:30:26 baget -> hof
Thalar is screwed up, apparently with coding.

2020-07-14T16:30:39 baget -> hof
My padawan told me to go fuck myself.

Life goes on...:-)

)))

2020-07-14T16:30:57 hof -> baget
fun

2020-07-14T16:31:04 baget -> hof
Wrong word.

2020-07-14T16:31:19 hof -> baget
so why did the padawan freak out?

2020-07-14T16:31:42 baget -> hof
Well, young. Inexperienced. Only 27.

2020-07-14T16:32:04 hof -> baget
hot guy )

2020-07-14T16:32:30 baget -> hof
I agree. No need to be rude to an engineer with 25 years of experience :-)

2020-07-14T16:32:45 baget -> hof
Here's thinking...

2020-07-14T16:32:56 baget -> hof
Fire or reward?

2020-07-14T16:33:24 baget -> hof
:-)

2020-07-14T16:33:37 baget -> hof
Where do you live?

2020-07-14T16:33:51 baget -> hof
Need some peaches?

2020-07-14T16:34:09 hof -> baget
Yeah, there's enough of everything.

2020-07-14T16:34:15 baget -> hof
Ripened again,...

2020-07-14T16:34:25 baget -> hof
Well, thank God for that.

2020-07-14T16:34:25 hof -> baget
so great

2020-07-14T16:34:41 baget -> hof
Lots of...

2020-07-14T16:35:18 baget -> hof
So what do you think?

2020-07-14T16:35:33 baget -> hof
Padawan to encourage or punish?

2020-07-14T16:35:40 baget -> hof
Or both?

2020-07-14T16:35:45 hof -> baget
I don't know, you know better.)

2020-07-14T16:35:47 baget -> hof
:-D

2020-07-14T16:35:56 baget -> hof
If only that were the case.

2020-07-14T16:36:03 baget -> hof
Didn't ask.

2020-07-14T16:36:20 hof -> baget
You should definitely scold them, you shouldn't send good people away.

2020-07-14T16:36:24 baget -> hof
I love sassy people, but I don't tolerate boorish people!

2020-07-14T16:36:43 baget -> hof
Uh-huh.

2020-07-14T16:36:59 baget -> hof
That's the conclusion I was coming to as well.

2020-07-14T16:37:02 baget -> hof
Thanks

2020-07-14T16:37:07 baget -> hof
How are you doing yourself?

2020-07-14T16:37:13 baget -> hof
Alive and well?

2020-07-14T16:37:28 hof -> baget
Fine, I'm doing a little repair work.

2020-07-14T16:37:37 hof -> baget
so sick of him already

2020-07-14T16:37:45 baget -> hof
Repair?

2020-07-14T16:37:45 hof -> baget
but other than that, it's fine.

2020-07-14T16:38:02 baget -> hof
Well, thank God for that!

2020-07-14T16:38:13 hof -> baget
Yes, you should sometimes

2020-07-14T16:38:34 baget -> hof
And I had my wedding over the weekend...

2020-07-14T16:38:56 hof -> baget
oh, it's always a joy

2020-07-14T16:39:04 baget -> hof
Agreed.

2020-07-14T16:39:08 hof -> baget
it's hard to come back from it.)

2020-07-14T16:39:15 baget -> hof
No.

2020-07-14T16:39:50 baget -> hof
Surprisingly enough, everything went extremely intelligently.

2020-07-14T16:40:00 baget -> hof
Didn't even get to the beer.

2020-07-14T16:40:09 hof -> baget
well done

2020-07-14T16:40:34 baget -> hof
It was hot :-D

2020-07-14T16:40:57 hof -> baget
the heat is good on the dry )

2020-07-14T16:41:53 baget -> hof
Uh-oh, not sure. However, field experiments have been abandoned.

2020-07-16T14:23:19 baget -> hof
Hi!

2020-07-16T14:23:34 hof -> baget
Hi

2020-07-16T14:23:56 baget -> hof
How's it going? Got a minute?

2020-07-16T14:23:59 baget -> hof
?

2020-07-16T14:24:45 hof -> baget
ok

2020-07-16T14:24:46 hof -> baget
there's

2020-07-16T14:37:45 baget -> hof
Oh, sorry.

2020-07-16T14:37:56 baget -> hof
This is where I have my own nightmare.

2020-07-16T14:38:33 baget -> hof
That's amazing. Already forgot what I wanted to ask.

2020-07-16T14:39:01 hof -> baget
)

2020-07-16T14:39:35 baget -> hof
А! I remember!!!

2020-07-16T14:39:53 baget -> hof
Listen, don't you remember how wind completes the process?

2020-07-16T14:40:10 baget -> hof
In the user ring?

2020-07-16T14:40:29 baget -> hof
Faced with a confusion.

2020-07-16T14:40:43 hof -> baget
I honestly don't remember

2020-07-16T14:40:49 baget -> hof
You can solve it head-on by fixing the stack.

2020-07-16T14:40:52 baget -> hof
See also.

2020-07-16T14:41:12 baget -> hof
I run it on my own in my exe context.

2020-07-16T14:41:27 baget -> hof
I do everything myself, I pass the control myself.

2020-07-16T14:41:52 baget -> hof
Notice, the hof of the process does not change.

2020-07-16T14:42:12 hof -> baget
What do you mean you set up the image in memory?

2020-07-16T14:42:13 baget -> hof
The running third-party process is terminated.

2020-07-16T14:42:26 baget -> hof
Let's say, at the request of the user.

2020-07-16T14:43:13 baget -> hof
At the end of this process hangs ExitProcesses()

2020-07-16T14:43:23 baget -> hof
That's an understandable one.

2020-07-16T14:44:53 baget -> hof
I intercept this call, restore the stack to the control transfer point to the inside, all crt passes, but as soon as I finish the process - my parent is some wild excelshin!

2020-07-16T14:45:05 baget -> hof
Under the dolbagger.

2020-07-16T14:45:24 baget -> hof
I recovered all the data in PEBe.

2020-07-16T14:45:35 baget -> hof
Don't know where to look?

2020-07-16T14:46:02 hof -> baget
I.e. did you create a process? CreateProcess?

2020-07-16T14:46:10 baget -> hof
No, no, no.

2020-07-16T14:46:33 baget -> hof
I deployed it all by myself, prescribed it myself, and transferred control to it myself.

2020-07-16T14:46:40 baget -> hof
It's basically a shell code.

2020-07-16T14:47:03 baget -> hof
Only very wide:-)

2020-07-16T14:47:16 hof -> baget
i.e. you got memory in your process, deployed sections to it, configured the import, and transferred control to the entry point?

2020-07-16T14:47:20 baget -> hof
Allocation of memory, stack, and other shit.

2020-07-16T14:47:28 baget -> hof
Right.

2020-07-16T14:47:37 hof -> baget
relocks too, of course

2020-07-16T14:47:37 baget -> hof
Fixed the fixups...

2020-07-16T14:47:40 hof -> baget
ok

2020-07-16T14:48:00 baget -> hof
You won't believe it, I even fixed the TLS

2020-07-16T14:48:11 hof -> baget
passed to the entry point, and then drop to ExitProcess ?

2020-07-16T14:48:13 baget -> hof
And everything is perfect.

2020-07-16T14:48:19 baget -> hof
NO!

2020-07-16T14:48:43 baget -> hof
ExitProcess I put on myself.

2020-07-16T14:48:51 baget -> hof
On the loader.

2020-07-16T14:49:00 baget -> hof
And everything is fine.

2020-07-16T14:49:09 baget -> hof
You can keep working.

2020-07-16T14:49:12 hof -> baget
so the loader is our process

2020-07-16T14:49:19 baget -> hof
Yes. Right.

2020-07-16T14:49:40 baget -> hof
I mean the exit from the loaded code.

2020-07-16T14:49:49 hof -> baget
so why do you call EXitProcess ?

2020-07-16T14:49:59 baget -> hof
That wasn't me.

2020-07-16T14:50:17 baget -> hof
This calls the RTL library!

2020-07-16T14:50:40 baget -> hof
Look, let me give you the source code

2020-07-16T14:50:44 baget -> hof
I'll throw it away?

2020-07-16T14:50:51 hof -> baget
drop me a line and I'll take a look.

2020-07-16T14:50:56 baget -> hof
It's easier to see once.

2020-07-16T14:50:58 baget -> hof
Right.

2020-07-16T14:51:14 baget -> hof
Do you have access to our git?

2020-07-16T14:51:34 baget -> hof
Or do you want it archived?

2020-07-16T14:51:50 hof -> baget
I have access, but to my projects, yours are closed

2020-07-16T14:52:01 hof -> baget
so it's better to archive

2020-07-16T14:52:04 baget -> hof
Yeah, then catch it in the archive.

2020-07-16T14:52:10 hof -> baget
What's the point anyway?

2020-07-16T14:52:15 baget -> hof
Bottom line. Я

2020-07-16T14:52:19 hof -> baget
What do you need it for?

2020-07-16T14:52:28 baget -> hof
Beckdor.

2020-07-16T14:52:38 baget -> hof
Command to update.

2020-07-16T14:52:55 hof -> baget
So, tell me more about it.

2020-07-16T14:53:00 baget -> hof
I leave the body of the backdoor and give control to the loader.

2020-07-16T14:53:14 baget -> hof
Who downloaded it before that.

2020-07-16T14:53:31 hof -> baget
how does the loader trigger the backdoor?

2020-07-16T14:53:52 hof -> baget
one process?

2020-07-16T14:53:55 baget -> hof
Loider, having deployed the backdoor in its address space, and running the backdoor

2020-07-16T14:53:57 baget -> hof
Yes

2020-07-16T14:54:10 baget -> hof
Don't interrupt, please.

2020-07-16T14:54:17 hof -> baget
I'm on the case )

2020-07-16T14:54:22 baget -> hof
Waiting for a report from backdoor.

2020-07-16T14:54:39 hof -> baget
i.e. the backdoor runs in a separate thread?

2020-07-16T14:54:48 baget -> hof
Why?

2020-07-16T14:55:09 baget -> hof
No, the loader will take the main execution thread to the backdoor.

2020-07-16T14:55:18 hof -> baget
or what? did the loader call the baget as a function?

2020-07-16T14:55:22 baget -> hof
As long as the backdoor is working, you don't need a lowader.

2020-07-16T14:55:27 baget -> hof
Yes!

2020-07-16T14:55:34 hof -> baget
got it

2020-07-16T14:55:51 baget -> hof
Well, via ventry point.

2020-07-16T14:55:58 hof -> baget
got the result from the backdoor and then what?

2020-07-16T14:56:13 baget -> hof
So far so good, everything is working.

2020-07-16T14:56:28 baget -> hof
But, I'm finishing up the execution of the loider.

2020-07-16T14:56:34 baget -> hof
And - kapel.

2020-07-16T14:56:35 hof -> baget
do you want to update the body of the backdoor specifically?

2020-07-16T14:56:40 hof -> baget
Or loader?

2020-07-16T14:56:57 baget -> hof
No, I want to close the lowader competently.

2020-07-16T14:57:05 baget -> hof
No mistakes.

2020-07-16T14:57:40 baget -> hof
I'm freeing up memory for the backdoor and I have exceptions.

2020-07-16T14:57:43 baget -> hof
In Lowader.

2020-07-16T14:57:54 baget -> hof
Beckdor is already gone.

2020-07-16T14:58:13 baget -> hof
I don't free up the backdoor memory - everything works!

2020-07-16T14:58:38 hof -> baget
is there a crt in backdoor?

2020-07-16T14:58:38 baget -> hof
VirtualAlloc(...) VirtualFree(...) pair

2020-07-16T14:58:52 baget -> hof
Absolutely!

2020-07-16T14:58:59 hof -> baget
I mean entry point own or WinMainCRTStartup

2020-07-16T14:59:02 baget -> hof
I put it there on purpose!

2020-07-16T14:59:08 baget -> hof
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2020-07-16T14:59:18 baget -> hof
WinMainCRTStartup

2020-07-16T14:59:18 hof -> baget
Why?

2020-07-16T14:59:33 baget -> hof
For the versatility of the loeder.

2020-07-16T14:59:52 baget -> hof
You never know what and where it will come in handy...:-)

2020-07-16T14:59:52 hof -> baget
why is there a crt in the backdoor?

2020-07-16T15:00:03 hof -> baget
in the loafer okay

2020-07-16T15:00:18 baget -> hof
Heh, so the debug is fully worked out there too!

2020-07-16T15:00:37 baget -> hof
And guess what, it works!

2020-07-16T15:00:53 hof -> baget
what debug?

2020-07-16T15:01:00 baget -> hof
All.

2020-07-16T15:01:37 baget -> hof
from int 3 and up to points in LDT

2020-07-16T15:01:46 baget -> hof
Well, that's bullshit.

2020-07-16T15:01:59 hof -> baget
The crt calls winmain and then EXitProcess

2020-07-16T15:02:09 baget -> hof
Right.

2020-07-16T15:02:19 baget -> hof
If not a console.

2020-07-16T15:02:33 baget -> hof
Right.

2020-07-16T15:02:49 hof -> baget
And if the console? is there no ExitProcess?

2020-07-16T15:02:57 hof -> baget
just ret ?

2020-07-16T15:03:02 baget -> hof
Check it out!

2020-07-16T15:03:21 baget -> hof
Yeah, I didn't know that either.

2020-07-16T15:03:23 hof -> baget
I'm pretty sure that all the trouble is from the crt

2020-07-16T15:03:32 hof -> baget
You don't need him there.

2020-07-16T15:03:50 hof -> baget
int 3 - will work without it

2020-07-16T15:03:50 baget -> hof
Not necessary for this task.

2020-07-16T15:04:14 baget -> hof
But, the mechanism is a smart one.

2020-07-16T15:04:21 baget -> hof
Here's what I was thinking...

2020-07-16T15:04:21 hof -> baget
drop crt from the backdoor, and jump straight to winmain

2020-07-16T15:04:46 baget -> hof
That's not exactly what I'd like...

2020-07-16T15:04:56 baget -> hof
Or rather, not that at all...

2020-07-16T15:05:01 baget -> hof
:-)

2020-07-16T15:05:22 baget -> hof
The conversation is taking place on an academic level.

2020-07-16T15:05:36 baget -> hof
I know how to run this shit.

2020-07-16T15:05:54 baget -> hof
Thought you could tell me how to do it without crutches.

2020-07-16T15:06:27 baget -> hof
Where didn't I see something?

2020-07-16T15:06:39 baget -> hof
Realistically, I don't know.

2020-07-16T15:06:53 baget -> hof
Let me throw you the code.

2020-07-16T15:06:58 baget -> hof
It would be easier.

2020-07-16T15:07:15 baget -> hof
If you're not busy and it's interesting to you.

2020-07-16T15:07:17 baget -> hof
:-)

2020-07-16T15:07:27:27 hof -> baget
Then take apart the crt code, something is going on there, maybe some api is called, for example AddVectoredExceptionHandler, where the address of the function is passed. You release the memory and this function doesn't exist anymore

2020-07-16T15:07:57 hof -> baget
and the control is transferred there, here's a fierce exception for you

2020-07-16T15:08:06 hof -> baget
crt is evil

2020-07-16T15:08:21 baget -> hof
Ahem, thank you.

2020-07-16T15:08:32 hof -> baget
especially since there are all kinds of them, each studio has a different one, and everything is worse

2020-07-16T15:08:36 baget -> hof
I had forgotten about that...

2020-07-16T15:08:49 baget -> hof
Yes, terribly annoying...

2020-07-16T15:08:52 baget -> hof
!!!

2020-07-16T15:08:59 hof -> baget
mingw has it too, and there's a lot of stuff in there too

2020-07-16T15:09:15 baget -> hof
Listen. You got that right.

2020-07-16T15:09:16 hof -> baget
Throw it away, what do you want there?

2020-07-16T15:09:18 baget -> hof
It.

2020-07-16T15:09:44 baget -> hof
I don't need anything from CRT in the backdoor.

2020-07-16T15:09:58 hof -> baget
can't compile something without crt? ask there, I'll tell you

2020-07-16T15:10:04 hof -> baget
So ask

2020-07-16T15:10:17 hof -> baget
and you will be happy

2020-07-16T15:10:18 baget -> hof
I was curious about the whole load - run - unload cycle again.

2020-07-16T15:10:40 baget -> hof
Nah, I can do that myself... Thank you very much.

2020-07-16T15:10:40 hof -> baget
it all works

2020-07-16T15:10:52 hof -> baget
But there's a lot of mess with the crt.

2020-07-16T15:11:27 baget -> hof
The idea is to create a loider that works without reference to all this crap.

2020-07-16T15:12:31 hof -> baget
i.e. so that the lowader can run any file?

2020-07-16T15:12:34 baget -> hof
Wait, I stated it wrong. Inside the load-laader, the load-launch-unload works.

2020-07-16T15:12:54 baget -> hof
I have trouble when the loader itself is already unloaded.

2020-07-16T15:13:09 baget -> hof
Yes, already any.

2020-07-16T15:13:17 baget -> hof
This is already working.

2020-07-16T15:13:53 baget -> hof
But as the loader itself reaches ExitProcess, there is an error.

2020-07-16T15:13:53 hof -> baget
i.e. the control returns to the loader? you call ExitProcess(0) in the loader and it crashes?

2020-07-16T15:14:06 baget -> hof
Yes!

2020-07-16T15:14:24 baget -> hof
Well, that's if you have to complete everything.

2020-07-16T15:14:42 baget -> hof
Without this you can download updates - run...

2020-07-16T15:14:51 baget -> hof
I've already done all that.

2020-07-16T15:16:25 hof -> baget
I think the exception handler is hovering somewhere, and the stack is unwinding to call destructors

2020-07-16T15:16:37 hof -> baget
And that's when it all goes down

2020-07-16T15:17:00 hof -> baget
Isn't that 32 bit code?

2020-07-16T15:17:34 hof -> baget
see stack unwinding, there is a chain created in the stack

2020-07-16T15:17:50 hof -> baget
here you need to break this chain, zero out

2020-07-16T15:18:02 hof -> baget
and then do EXitProcess

2020-07-16T15:18:20 baget -> hof
No, no, no.

2020-07-16T15:18:37 baget -> hof
All said only in the context of x64

2020-07-16T15:19:03 baget -> hof
No problem with 32...

2020-07-16T15:19:12 baget -> hof
I'm sorry I didn't tell you right away.

2020-07-16T15:19:35 baget -> hof
That's what I'm trying to catch.

2020-07-16T15:19:50 hof -> baget
Send me the code, I'll take a look

2020-07-16T15:19:57 baget -> hof
Discounting.

Only PELoader is interesting.

2020-07-16T15:30:08 baget -> hof
everything else is garbage.

2020-07-16T15:30:43 baget -> hof
Everything works without calling UnloadBot

2020-07-16T15:31:02 baget -> hof
I would be extremely grateful:-)

2020-07-16T15:31:13 hof -> baget
ok

2020-07-16T15:31:15 baget -> hof
Because my head is already swollen.

2020-07-16T15:31:28 hof -> baget
I can't today, I'll look tomorrow morning.

2020-07-16T15:31:35 baget -> hof
Maybe I'm stupidly looking at the point... :-D

2020-07-16T15:31:42 baget -> hof
Yes, yes, of course.

2020-07-16T15:31:59 baget -> hof
Thank you very much.

2020-07-16T15:32:07 hof -> baget
you're welcome

2020-07-16T15:32:09 baget -> hof
Nah, really curious!

2020-07-21T15:53:03 baget -> hof
Hof, dear, hello.

2020-07-22T13:40:34 baget -> hof
Hi!

2020-07-22T13:40:59 hof -> baget
hi

2020-07-22T13:41:19 baget -> hof
Hof, dear, I have a huge favor to ask of you.

2020-07-22T13:41:31 baget -> hof
There is no green, and you need to replace the vntz module.

2020-07-22T13:41:39 hof -> baget
no problem

2020-07-22T13:41:44 baget -> hof
Can you help me?

2020-07-22T13:41:45 hof -> baget
send me a continuous

2020-07-22T13:41:45 hof -> baget
send me a continuous

2020-07-22T13:41:59 baget -> hof
Pacha's going to throw it to you now.

2020-07-22T13:42:07 baget -> hof
Thank you very much.

2020-07-22T13:42:16 hof -> baget
ok, no problem

2020-07-23T15:10:42 baget -> hof
Hi.

2020-07-23T15:19:14 hof -> baget

Got a lot of work to do today.

2020-07-23T15:20:39 hof -> baget
Good thing tomorrow is Friday.

2020-07-23T15:21:05 baget -> hof
It would have been better if it was today.

2020-07-23T15:21:23 baget -> hof
I'm tired of something...

2020-07-23T15:21:28 baget -> hof
How are you yourself?

2020-07-23T15:22:04 hof -> baget
roughly the same

2020-07-23T15:22:21 baget -> hof
Yep.

2020-07-23T15:22:32 baget -> hof
You have to go on vacation.

2020-07-23T15:22:42 baget -> hof
At least for a week...

2020-07-23T15:23:34 hof -> baget
Please, of course.

2020-07-23T16:38:58 hof -> baget
Please tell me in simple words what does Mimi, which you cleaned

2020-07-23T16:39:07 hof -> baget
BagetMimi

2020-07-23T16:39:42 baget -> hof
Sorry, but I didn't clean the mimi

2020-07-23T16:39:57 hof -> baget
mimicatz

2020-07-23T16:40:12 baget -> hof
Yes, I rewrote it.

2020-07-23T16:40:22 baget -> hof
I didn't.

2020-07-23T16:40:27 hof -> baget
What does he do anyway?

2020-07-23T16:40:35 hof -> baget
What is it for?

2020-07-23T16:40:48 hof -> baget
disassembling the module in which mimi is embedded

2020-07-23T16:40:57 baget -> hof
Right.

2020-07-23T16:41:05 hof -> baget
I want to understand and I don't have the strength to dig

2020-07-23T16:41:25 baget -> hof
Mimic accesses network passwords.

2020-07-23T16:41:35 baget -> hof
Via widgest

2020-07-23T16:42:14 hof -> baget
ok, I see roughly

2020-07-23T16:42:41 baget -> hof
Do you have the source code?

2020-07-23T16:43:08 baget -> hof
Ah. yes. Apparently there is.

2020-07-23T16:43:21 baget -> hof
But, I wouldn't waste my time with a mimic....

2020-07-23T16:43:38 baget -> hof
It's outdated.

2020-07-23T16:43:43 hof -> baget

2020-07-23T16:43:52 baget -> hof
What?

2020-07-23T16:44:02 hof -> baget
Ever heard of it?

2020-07-23T16:44:09 baget -> hof
No, of course not.

2020-07-23T16:44:20 baget -> hof
All they say to me is - DO IT!

2020-07-23T16:44:36 baget -> hof
But, they don't say take it...:-)

2020-07-23T16:44:51 hof -> baget
Yes, everyone here is saying let's

2020-07-23T16:45:12 baget -> hof
What kind of module is it and why does it need a mimic if it's a DLL?

2020-07-23T16:45:55 hof -> baget
I'm sorting it out

2020-07-23T16:54:19 baget -> hof
Hof, buddy, did you vntz change recently????

2020-07-23T16:54:54 hof -> baget
yes

2020-07-23T16:56:17 baget -> hof
Buddy, roll it back if you can.

2020-07-23T16:56:44 baget -> hof
I'll put my hands in Pahea's mouth, through his ass.

2020-07-23T16:56:53 baget -> hof
Fucking mocking me.

2020-07-23T16:57:13 hof -> baget
sec, I'll see how far I can roll back

2020-07-23T16:57:25 baget -> hof
Very much so.

2020-07-23T16:57:37 hof -> baget
he was still discounting in the morning.

2020-07-23T16:57:43 hof -> baget
But I deleted that one.

2020-07-23T16:57:51 baget -> hof
Holy shit...

2020-07-23T16:58:12 hof -> baget
from the 21st have

2020-07-23T16:58:31 hof -> baget
need a morning one?

2020-07-23T16:58:32 baget -> hof
No, this one beats AV.

2020-07-23T16:58:40 baget -> hof
Yes.

2020-07-23T16:58:45 hof -> baget
I'll look for references

2020-07-23T16:58:53 baget -> hof
Fuck, I'm going to fire him...

2020-07-23T16:59:22 baget -> hof
Fucking saboteur.

2020-07-23T16:59:32 hof -> baget
What did you screw up?

2020-07-23T16:59:37 baget -> hof
All.

2020-07-23T16:59:47 baget -> hof
Achieved the unbelievable.

2020-07-23T17:00:08 baget -> hof
"Desktop creation error"

2020-07-23T17:00:21 baget -> hof
I put that message in for fun!

2020-07-23T17:02:47 hof -> baget
Isn't there a test?

2020-07-23T17:03:19 hof -> baget
rolled back

2020-07-23T17:03:24 hof -> baget
before the morning

2020-07-23T17:03:30 hof -> baget
test it

2020-07-23T17:09:16 baget -> hof
Low bow.

2020-07-23T17:09:56 baget -> hof
Pussy...., it's the students that decided to get pissed off.

2020-07-23T17:10:27 hof -> baget
it happens, you have to test it somehow

2020-07-23T17:10:32 hof -> baget
Let him write a test.

2020-07-23T17:10:47 hof -> baget
and checks on the main virtualisations after cleaning

2020-07-23T17:10:50 baget -> hof
You don't need a test there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2020-07-23T17:11:14 hof -> baget
hhz, he's always a bit of a handful.

2020-07-23T17:11:24 baget -> hof
The phrase "Desktop creation error" is enough there.

2020-07-23T17:11:45 baget -> hof
I can't even tell you what you need to do to do that.

2020-07-23T17:12:15 baget -> hof
Really, I left it there for fun!

2020-07-23T17:19:01 baget -> hof
Hof, thank you very much.

2020-07-23T17:19:11 baget -> hof
I'm going to change Pahu...

2020-07-23T17:19:29 hof -> baget
you're welcome

2020-07-23T17:19:48 baget -> hof
Some kind of irresponsibility bordering on criminal.

2020-07-23T17:20:42 hof -> baget
pfft

2020-07-23T17:21:00 baget -> hof
No, dearie, it's something else...

2020-07-23T17:21:08 baget -> hof
Certainly not a pissant.

2020-07-23T17:21:37 baget -> hof
I was discounting the venerable age, but it's a bust.

2020-07-23T17:23:43 hof -> baget
Okay, good luck. I need to run early today.

2020-07-24T15:28:07 hof -> baget
hi

2020-07-24T15:28:26 baget -> hof
Hi!

2020-07-24T15:28:29 hof -> baget
in which case can the Control function return 0 ?

2020-07-24T15:28:38 hof -> baget
in vnc

2020-07-24T15:28:43 hof -> baget
When transferring a config

2020-07-24T15:30:56 baget -> hof
Yes. If there is an error in the parsing of the config.

2020-07-24T15:31:50 hof -> baget
strange, but they say it worked recently

2020-07-24T15:31:59 hof -> baget
But it stopped after 14 Moscow time

2020-07-24T15:32:07 hof -> baget
Maybe they made a mistake in the config

2020-07-24T15:32:15 hof -> baget
I'll write now, they'll check it out.

2020-07-24T15:32:22 baget -> hof
Maybe...

2020-07-24T15:32:41 baget -> hof
There are other options, but they are highly unlikely.

2020-07-24T15:33:08 hof -> baget
ok

2020-07-24T15:40:02 hof -> baget
Def writes that this is the configuration

2020-07-24T15:40:05 hof -> baget

185.172.129.62
185.142.99.25
185.180.197.120

2020-07-24T15:40:17 hof -> baget
Why isn't the module accepted?

2020-07-24T15:40:59 hof -> baget
have you changed the module recently? the one I filled in yesterday?

2020-07-24T15:41:07 baget -> hof
No.

2020-07-24T15:41:11 baget -> hof
They didn't.

2020-07-24T15:41:25 baget -> hof
The one you filled in is still standing.

2020-07-24T15:41:25 hof -> baget
what the hell

2020-07-24T15:41:34 baget -> hof
Agreed.

2020-07-24T15:42:12 baget -> hof
This config should be eaten anyway.

2020-07-24T15:42:55 hof -> baget
What does the test exe pass to the module?

2020-07-24T15:43:01 hof -> baget
what's the config?

2020-07-24T15:43:12 baget -> hof
Same.

2020-07-24T15:43:16 hof -> baget
StartVNCSRV.exe

2020-07-24T15:44:08 hof -> baget
it doesn't download the config from the disk?

2020-07-24T15:44:26 baget -> hof
No.

2020-07-24T15:45:12 baget -> hof
There: char *Conf = "185.172.129.62\r\n185.142.99.25\r\n185.180.197.120\r\n";

2020-07-24T15:45:23 baget -> hof

2020-07-24T15:45:28 baget -> hof


2020-07-24T15:46:13 baget -> hof
Look, he's not passing it in Unicode, is he?

2020-07-24T15:46:18 hof -> baget
192.3.247.116

2020-07-24T15:46:24 hof -> baget
Here's what's stitched in there

2020-07-24T15:46:36 hof -> baget
Pavlukha sent me this

2020-07-24T15:46:56 baget -> hof
Ah, so I got Dora a new one put together.

2020-07-24T15:47:07 hof -> baget
instruct him to have the test exe download the conf.txt file

2020-07-24T15:47:20 hof -> baget
and passed its data to the module during the test

2020-07-24T15:47:26 baget -> hof
I can do it myself.

2020-07-24T15:47:29 baget -> hof
:-)

2020-07-24T15:47:41 baget -> hof
Wait.

2020-07-24T15:47:52 baget -> hof
It's not like we changed the module.

2020-07-24T15:48:05 hof -> baget
Yeah, that's weird.

2020-07-24T15:48:09 baget -> hof
So the stump is the deck is somewhere else.

2020-07-24T15:48:56 baget -> hof
0 on the output can also be with an empty config.

2020-07-24T15:49:37 hof -> baget
ok

2020-07-27T08:55:00 hof -> baget
Hi

2020-07-27T08:55:11 hof -> baget
New module was uploaded recently.

2020-07-27T08:55:16 baget -> hof
Hi.

2020-07-27T08:55:45 hof -> baget
I downloaded your padawan, he changed the test to load the config from the disk

2020-07-27T08:56:12 hof -> baget
but never answered what was in the pt with the module

2020-07-27T08:56:37 hof -> baget
Why from Control false returned

2020-07-27T08:56:44 baget -> hof
Hof, my friend, nothing happened... The module didn't change at all.

2020-07-27T08:57:13 hof -> baget
was, and the config was normal

2020-07-27T08:57:14 baget -> hof
Either null config came, or it was different from inet_addr() format

2020-07-27T08:57:37 baget -> hof
Fuck knows...

2020-07-27T08:58:10 hof -> baget
ok

2020-07-27T08:58:20 baget -> hof
Hof, and not one module is missing...

2020-07-27T08:58:45 baget -> hof
Realistically no...

2020-07-27T08:58:50 baget -> hof
О!

2020-07-27T08:58:53 baget -> hof
Hint.

2020-07-27T09:07:11 hof -> baget
didn't get it

2020-07-27T09:07:32 baget -> hof
Have you worked with unnamed pips?

2020-07-27T09:07:51 hof -> baget
nope

2020-07-27T09:07:59 baget -> hof
Pity. Question removed.

2020-07-27T09:08:18 baget -> hof
Hof, and there's not a single module in the admin...

2020-07-27T09:08:34 hof -> baget
What do you mean?

2020-07-27T09:08:48 baget -> hof

2020-07-27T09:08:51 baget -> hof

2020-07-27T09:08:58 baget -> hof
The modules don't go up.

2020-07-27T09:09:03 hof -> baget
After replacing the module?

2020-07-27T09:09:11 baget -> hof
It was still working this morning.

2020-07-27T09:09:24 baget -> hof
I somehow didn't keep track of when it happened...

2020-07-27T09:09:40 hof -> baget
I replaced the module about 20 minutes ago.

2020-07-27T09:09:51 baget -> hof
I'm looking at zero right now.

2020-07-27T09:10:07 hof -> baget
pads?

2020-07-27T09:10:34 baget -> hof
I'm not sure...

2020-07-27T09:10:47 baget -> hof
All three at once?

2020-07-27T09:11:39 hof -> baget
Is the module not working again?

2020-07-27T09:11:58 hof -> baget
I'm going to try to debug it now, sec

2020-07-27T09:17:07 baget -> hof
Check.

2020-07-27T09:19:31 hof -> baget
Yes, it's a test one.

2020-07-27T09:19:38 hof -> baget
So everything should work

2020-07-27T13:05:45 baget -> hof
Hi again.

2020-07-27T13:06:05 hof -> baget
Hi

2020-07-27T13:07:51 baget -> hof
I'll send you the module, please put it on.

2020-07-27T13:08:01 hof -> baget
ok

2020-07-27T13:08:18 baget -> hof
It's my birthday tomorrow.... I don't think I'm going to make it.

2020-07-27T13:11:15 baget -> hof
One minute.

2020-07-27T13:11:26 hof -> baget
I asked the tester to run the module on the test vm

2020-07-27T13:11:34 baget -> hof
Fuck off!

2020-07-27T13:11:47 baget -> hof
Look at what's going on in the real world!!!

2020-07-27T13:11:54 baget -> hof
Not a single worker.

2020-07-27T13:12:03 baget -> hof
But, that's not what I mean.

2020-07-27T13:12:20 baget -> hof
You can make a fucking run from you, can't you?

2020-07-27T13:13:13 hof -> baget

2020-07-27T13:13:41 baget -> hof
I'll tell you the lines to look at, too.

2020-07-27T13:17:19 baget -> hof
If desk==0

2020-07-27T13:17:26 baget -> hof
That's more accurate.

2020-07-27T13:17:32 hof -> baget
So build a version with the log

2020-07-27T13:17:43 baget -> hof
Fuck the log.

2020-07-27T13:17:57 baget -> hof
I'm about to get my head bitten off!!!!!!!

2020-07-27T13:18:16 baget -> hof
See for yourself what's going on there.

2020-07-27T13:18:24 baget -> hof
It all fucking works for me!!!!!!!

2020-07-27T13:18:56 hof -> baget
I'm about to run it on mine.

2020-07-27T13:18:57 baget -> hof
I was sure it was fixed, fuck!!!!!!!

2020-07-27T13:19:26 baget -> hof
Failure -100%.

2020-07-27T13:19:34 baget -> hof
I'm going to be buried....

2020-07-27T13:30:17 hof -> baget
What makes you think the module doesn't work

2020-07-27T13:30:27 hof -> baget
I ran it on a test one, it's fine

2020-07-27T13:30:42 hof -> baget
What systems are the problems on?

2020-07-27T13:34:32 baget -> hof
It doesn't create a desktop!!!

2020-07-27T13:34:37 baget -> hof
Hof, darling!

2020-07-27T13:35:18 hof -> baget
i.e. the module connects, but does not work

2020-07-27T13:35:42 baget -> hof
Did you get the source code?

2020-07-27T13:35:48 baget -> hof
The answer is yes.

2020-07-27T13:35:55 baget -> hof
100% bounce rate.

2020-07-27T13:36:24 hof -> baget
and when you fill in your old module, does it work?

2020-07-27T13:36:40 baget -> hof
This is not an old module.

2020-07-27T13:36:50 baget -> hof
This is a new one, but the answer is yes.

2020-07-27T13:36:55 hof -> baget
I just saw that the pt poured a small size module

2020-07-27T13:37:08 hof -> baget
you used to collect such beautiful

2020-07-27T13:37:21 baget -> hof
This is -me.

2020-07-27T13:37:26 hof -> baget
now on 17, 19 studios compile, 1mb each

2020-07-27T13:37:35 baget -> hof
Come on...

2020-07-27T13:37:43 baget -> hof
It can't be.

2020-07-27T13:37:54 baget -> hof
120...130 kB max.

2020-07-27T13:37:55 hof -> baget
Why did you move there?

2020-07-27T13:38:03 baget -> hof
Where to?

2020-07-27T13:38:05 hof -> baget
which one? more than 1 mb

2020-07-27T13:38:13 baget -> hof
Yeah, well.

2020-07-27T13:38:21 hof -> baget
pate is constantly dropping more than 1 mb

2020-07-27T13:38:26 hof -> baget
more

2020-07-27T13:38:35 baget -> hof
Oyu

2020-07-27T13:38:39 hof -> baget
)

2020-07-27T13:38:45 hof -> baget
aren't you in the circle?

2020-07-27T13:38:48 hof -> baget
go to

2020-07-27T13:38:50 baget -> hof
No.

2020-07-27T13:39:00 baget -> hof
I wasn't even following...

2020-07-27T13:39:07 hof -> baget
Have him send you the finished one, take a look at it.

2020-07-27T13:39:16 baget -> hof
What did he put in there?

2020-07-27T13:39:34 hof -> baget
I don't know, I think I was talking about sqlite3

2020-07-27T13:39:45 baget -> hof
WHY???????

2020-07-27T13:39:49 baget -> hof
Okay, fuck...

2020-07-27T13:39:54 hof -> baget
I don't remember, it was a long time ago.

2020-07-27T13:40:03 baget -> hof
Take a look at the desktop, please.

2020-07-27T13:40:03 hof -> baget
figure it out there.

2020-07-27T13:40:21 baget -> hof
Piz...., I have two more projects...

2020-07-27T13:40:37 baget -> hof
I can't shovel with these...

2020-07-27T13:40:44 baget -> hof
Okay.

2020-07-27T13:40:49 baget -> hof
It's not difficult.

2020-07-27T13:41:27 baget -> hof
Ah, sqlite3 is for browsers.

2020-07-27T13:41:31 baget -> hof
Recall.

2020-07-27T13:41:41 baget -> hof
But a meter and a half is out of the question.

2020-07-27T13:42:51 hof -> baget
Yes, it's 300kb.

2020-07-27T13:43:25 baget -> hof
Oh, well, that's... Give or take, though it's also a bit much...

2020-07-27T13:59:11 hof -> baget
There is most likely a problem with string encryption

2020-07-27T13:59:29 hof -> baget
now will remove the encryption, let's see

2020-07-27T14:09:50 baget -> hof
Please.

2020-07-27T14:10:12 hof -> baget
poured as tvncDll

2020-07-27T14:10:13 baget -> hof
I prepared the VNC, just the way you like it.... 88 kB

2020-07-27T14:10:15 hof -> baget
testing

2020-07-27T14:10:23 hof -> baget
oh, it's thetma

2020-07-27T14:10:25 hof -> baget


2020-07-27T14:10:26 baget -> hof
Thank you very much.

2020-07-27T14:11:15 baget -> hof
When I'm done with the locker and backdoor, I'll ask Stern to give me a month for the new VNC.

2020-07-27T14:11:20 baget -> hof
Brand new.

2020-07-27T14:11:25 baget -> hof
new*

2020-07-27T14:11:55 baget -> hof
I think at 60...65, we'll get there...

2020-07-27T14:12:25 baget -> hof
Plus, the backdoor polygon brought such fun thoughts to mind....:-)

2020-07-27T14:12:27 hof -> baget
That's not the point, I just think that somehow the crt affects the launch in memory

2020-07-27T14:12:46 hof -> baget
especially these new studios 17, 19

2020-07-27T14:12:47 baget -> hof
Well, there's no VNC Crt...

2020-07-27T14:12:56 hof -> baget
of course )

2020-07-27T14:13:03 hof -> baget
88 maybe not.

2020-07-27T14:13:14 baget -> hof
Well, why would you do that.

2020-07-27T14:13:19 hof -> baget
but the one that baget is discounting 100% has

2020-07-27T14:13:30 baget -> hof
This is a bad thing.

2020-07-27T14:13:33 baget -> hof
Ha!

2020-07-27T14:13:42 baget -> hof
So hence the size.

2020-07-27T14:13:44 hof -> baget
That's where these problems come in.

2020-07-27T14:13:51 hof -> baget
and size, of course

2020-07-27T14:14:13 baget -> hof
What the fuck is a crt?

2020-07-27T14:14:32 baget -> hof
There's nothing in the vnts...

2020-07-27T14:14:47 baget -> hof
Everything there is extremely primitive...

2020-07-27T14:14:57 hof -> baget
CBB6A21990077AE2DD40C332A199880F

2020-07-27T14:15:02 hof -> baget
here you go

2020-07-27T14:15:11 hof -> baget
this is my tentpole.

2020-07-27T14:15:18 baget -> hof
I don't see it yet.

2020-07-27T14:15:52 baget -> hof
Pahu I see.

2020-07-27T14:16:08 baget -> hof
CBB6 I don't see it.

2020-07-27T14:16:27 baget -> hof
Nope....

2020-07-27T14:18:10 baget -> hof
Are you sure you're up and running?

2020-07-27T14:18:32 hof -> baget
Yeah, but it looks like he crashed.

2020-07-27T14:18:51 baget -> hof
This is bad.

2020-07-27T14:21:39 hof -> baget
How much does your small size stare?

2020-07-27T14:22:12 baget -> hof
It doesn't stink at all.

2020-07-27T14:22:23 hof -> baget
Let's fill it up for now.

2020-07-27T14:22:27 baget -> hof
But, it doesn't have the same functionality...

2020-07-27T14:22:34 baget -> hof
Already doing it, buddy.

2020-07-27T14:22:41 baget -> hof
Already doing it.

2020-07-27T14:22:46 hof -> baget
ok

2020-07-27T14:22:50 baget -> hof
Didn't mean to.

2020-07-27T14:28:05 hof -> baget
CBB6A21990077AE2DD40C332A199880F

2020-07-27T14:28:15 hof -> baget
maybe it will work

2020-07-27T14:28:19 hof -> baget
appeared

2020-07-27T14:28:31 baget -> hof
moment.

2020-07-27T14:28:50 hof -> baget
I did it with the encryption of strings new

2020-07-27T14:28:56 baget -> hof
Right.

2020-07-27T14:28:59 baget -> hof
Woschel.

2020-07-27T14:29:07 baget -> hof
I see two monitors.

2020-07-27T14:29:20 baget -> hof
That's a bummer.

2020-07-27T14:29:31 hof -> baget
I'll let baget know that the encryption is fine

2020-07-27T14:29:39 baget -> hof
О!

2020-07-27T14:29:51 baget -> hof
I see you with Capture!

2020-07-27T14:30:05 hof -> baget
replacing the combat module with this one

2020-07-27T14:30:18 baget -> hof
Come on!

2020-07-27T14:30:25 baget -> hof
Okay, one more time.

2020-07-27T14:30:28 baget -> hof
What was it???

2020-07-27T14:30:48 baget -> hof
Not a distraction.

2020-07-27T14:31:05 hof -> baget
I don't know what happened.

2020-07-27T14:31:16 hof -> baget
ask baget what he changed in the last one

2020-07-27T14:31:17 baget -> hof
Hmm, nice DebugView...

2020-07-27T14:31:20 hof -> baget
it works

2020-07-27T14:31:33 hof -> baget
Sure, use it too

2020-07-27T14:31:38 hof -> baget
DebugView++

2020-07-27T14:31:46 baget -> hof
Please drop it off.

2020-07-27T14:31:52 hof -> baget
jr

2020-07-27T14:31:53 hof -> baget
ok

2020-07-27T14:32:03 baget -> hof
Thank you.

2020-07-27T14:32:33 hof -> baget
replaced the main module

2020-07-27T14:32:41 baget -> hof
Well, Godspeed.

2020-07-27T14:34:19 baget -> hof
No, well, green trees...

2020-07-27T14:34:24 baget -> hof
It worked.

2020-07-27T14:34:35 baget -> hof
Off to bash Pahea's head in.

2020-07-27T14:38:12 hof -> baget
I don't think it's paha's fault.

2020-07-27T14:38:41 hof -> baget
you need to figure it out, something affects it, and when it is run from memory

2020-07-27T14:39:00 hof -> baget
see, when there is a test run, there is no problem

2020-07-27T14:39:09 hof -> baget
But just figuring out what

2020-07-27T14:40:08 hof -> baget
D73FBB8F199AABB954595D837FA703D2

2020-07-27T14:40:13 hof -> baget
Here's another tester running

2020-07-27T14:40:27 hof -> baget
and this one will soon be 7D7C4921D0D0A613534337FE8BEC5AD6D4

2020-07-27T14:55:40 baget -> hof
Don't relax it for me :-)

2020-07-27T14:55:59 baget -> hof
Either way - he's in trouble.

2020-07-27T16:16:52 hof -> baget
I forgot to upload the debugview.

2020-08-26T13:08:16 hof -> baget
not going on vacation?

2020-08-26T13:08:25 baget -> hof
Excluded.

2020-08-26T13:08:49 baget -> hof
I've been with you for 3 years now, and I don't get a vacation yet.

2020-08-26T13:08:55 hof -> baget
)

2020-08-26T13:09:20 baget -> hof
In all seriousness, maybe in October.

2020-08-26T13:09:57 baget -> hof
But, something tells me, ....

2020-08-26T13:10:34 baget -> hof
It's hot here, these days.

2020-08-26T13:10:47 baget -> hof
It's silly to go on vacation.

2020-08-26T13:11:01 baget -> hof
It's silly to go out of the house...:-)

2020-08-26T13:11:18 hof -> baget
Yeah, when it's too hot, not so much

2020-08-26T13:11:27 baget -> hof
Exactly.

Hi!
