Oh, hello!!!

2020-08-04T18:58:46 baget -> max
Hi!

2020-08-04T18:58:52 baget -> max
How's it going?

2020-08-04T19:01:01 max -> baget
Too bad, the admins can't configure the server yet, to make the web sockets work in the project. And I've written 3 times, and all because they could not set up the server. 4-th time I do not want to rewrite :). And you?

2020-08-04T19:01:30 baget -> max
Fuck it.

2020-08-04T19:01:36 baget -> max
How is it yourself?

2020-08-04T19:02:06 baget -> max
Ðž! New addition to the family!

2020-08-04T19:02:27 baget -> max
My sister got married!

2020-08-04T19:03:11 baget -> max
Alive and well!

2020-08-04T19:03:23 baget -> max
How are you doing out there?

2020-08-04T19:03:28 baget -> max
:-)

2020-08-04T19:52:02 max -> baget
How many sisters do you have? :)

2020-08-04T19:52:34 baget -> max
Smart question.

2020-08-04T19:52:47 baget -> max
Alone! :-D

2020-08-04T19:52:55 baget -> max
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2020-08-04T19:53:02 baget -> max
It's all her.

2020-08-04T19:53:27 max -> baget
How are your nieces and nephews? Are they her daughters? Or do you also have a brother? :)
We're all alive and well, thank you! There are even some Russians here, so there's someone to talk to.

2020-08-04T19:55:12 baget -> max
No, no.

2020-08-04T19:55:14 baget -> max
Her.

2020-08-04T19:55:32 baget -> max
But, these are the flowers of life.

2020-08-04T19:55:43 baget -> max
On my uncle's grave!

2020-08-04T19:56:33 baget -> max
Well, thank God!

2020-08-04T19:56:39 max -> baget
:)

2020-08-04T19:58:03 baget -> max
By the way, I decided to go to Argentina.

2020-08-04T19:58:13 baget -> max
How far away are you?

2020-08-04T19:58:23 baget -> max
September 3.

2020-08-04T19:58:33 baget -> max
In Buenos...

2020-08-04T19:58:46 max -> baget
It's a long way from me. Why is it that way? For good?

2020-08-04T19:58:55 baget -> max
No.

2020-08-04T19:59:05 baget -> max
A day or two... No more than that.

2020-08-04T19:59:49 baget -> max
If more than that, then, at all.

2020-08-04T19:59:51 baget -> max
:-)

2020-08-04T20:00:19 max -> baget
No way, you'll be between heaven and earth for a week just from changing time zones, you'll only get a headache from the trip. Take more.

2020-08-04T20:00:38 baget -> max
Thank you.

2020-08-04T20:00:42 baget -> max
Don't.

2020-08-04T20:00:46 baget -> max
Accustomed.

2020-08-04T20:00:56 max -> baget
Well, see for yourself :)

2020-08-04T20:01:07 baget -> max
I really like to fly.

2020-08-04T20:01:28 baget -> max
I want to fly around the planet in 80 hours.

2020-08-04T20:01:36 baget -> max
hours*

2020-08-04T20:02:02 baget -> max
Wanted to this year, but with the pandemic, unlikely to come out.

2020-08-04T20:04:20:20 baget -> max
But given the number of relatives, it's unlikely they'll let you go...

2020-08-04T20:04:46 baget -> max
Regardless of the pandemic.

2020-08-04T20:04:49 baget -> max
:-)

2020-08-04T20:05:28 baget -> max
Really, I love flying so much.

2020-08-04T20:05:51 max -> baget
Oh, I don't, it's hard for me to spend 9 hours on an airplane.

2020-08-04T20:06:20 baget -> max
And as I get on the plane, I get excited again....

2020-08-04T20:06:32 baget -> max
I'm born.

2020-08-04T20:06:57 baget -> max
I love it very much.

2020-08-04T20:07:16 baget -> max
Time does not matter.

2020-08-04T20:07:29 max -> baget
:)

2020-08-04T20:07:31 baget -> max
Every minute is a delight.

2020-08-04T20:07:40 baget -> max
No, really...

2020-08-04T20:08:20 baget -> max
I'm not kidding.

2020-08-04T20:08:34 baget -> max
For me, this is the best vacation ever.

2020-08-04T20:09:05 baget -> max
Habit - dangling between heaven and earth. :-D

2020-10-21T19:42:56 baget -> max
Hi!

2020-10-21T19:43:07 max -> baget
Hi!

2020-10-21T19:43:38 baget -> max
How are you doing there?
