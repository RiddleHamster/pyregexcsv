2020-06-22T17:00:51 braun -> baget
Hi, buddy)

2020-06-22T17:01:00 braun -> baget
how are you?

2020-06-23T11:54:04 braun -> baget
Greetings.

2020-06-24T14:56:55 braun -> baget
Hi, here?

2020-06-24T14:57:12 baget -> braun
Tut.

2020-06-24T14:57:17 baget -> braun
 where should I be?

2020-06-24T14:57:21 baget -> braun
Hi!

2020-06-24T14:57:23 braun -> baget
At sea)

2020-06-24T14:57:30 baget -> braun
Rain.

2020-06-24T14:57:34 baget -> braun
Thunderstorm.

2020-06-24T14:57:49 braun -> baget
And we're stuffy, send us some)

2020-06-24T14:57:51 baget -> braun
Hurry up and tell me, I'm going to chop everything up.

2020-06-24T14:58:15 baget -> braun
We're about to have a light up here.

2020-06-24T14:58:26 baget -> braun
There is a wall of lightning on the horizon.

2020-06-24T14:58:30 braun -> baget
got it

2020-06-24T14:58:32 baget -> braun
It goes here, too.

2020-06-24T14:58:59 baget -> braun
Nah, that's a mess!

2020-06-24T14:59:11 baget -> braun
It's going to be a fun night!

2020-06-24T14:59:25 braun -> baget
Victory Day))

2020-06-24T14:59:34 baget -> braun
ah, that's...

2020-06-24T14:59:41 baget -> braun
Yes, I forgot.

2020-06-24T15:00:02 baget -> braun
We had a fucking great parade today in Sevastopol!

2020-06-24T15:01:48 braun -> baget
46.249.32.111 $data['group_name'] proc.txt serv.txt rfiles.txt wfiles.txt dfiles.txt ffiles.txt lpage.txt

Tell me if we put $data['group_name'] here with the line RkpIeTU1OD06Omw1QU41bGJDcjFmQmg1L28=

will the locker be created and will it send this data to the API?

2020-06-24T15:02:05 braun -> baget
Or do you have a serious character limit there?

2020-06-24T15:02:22 baget -> braun
No.

2020-06-24T15:02:27 baget -> braun
That won't work.

2020-06-24T15:02:43 baget -> braun
If necessary, we'll adapt it.

2020-06-24T15:03:03 baget -> braun
We're writing on the pluses.

2020-06-24T15:03:58 baget -> braun
I will get this very line from you.

2020-06-24T15:04:15 baget -> braun
It will have to be interpreted afterwards...:-)

2020-06-24T15:04:34 braun -> baget
interpret?

2020-06-24T15:05:13 baget -> braun
Again.

2020-06-24T15:05:25 baget -> braun
You will pass this line to the builder.

2020-06-24T15:05:30 baget -> braun
I'm going to get it.

2020-06-24T15:05:41 baget -> braun
Wait, or what are you talking about?

2020-06-24T15:06:02 braun -> baget
[19:04:15] <baget (locker)> It will have to be interpreted afterwards...:-)

Is that what I mean?)

2020-06-24T15:06:18 baget -> braun
Is this a macro or a thread?

2020-06-24T15:06:22 baget -> braun
I don't get it.

2020-06-24T15:06:43 baget -> braun
What do you want to pass on?

2020-06-24T15:06:48 baget -> braun
No characters.

2020-06-24T15:06:54 baget -> braun
In words, say it.

2020-06-24T15:07:02 braun -> baget
I want to pass the encrypted name of the group

2020-06-24T15:07:12 baget -> braun
Why???

2020-06-24T15:07:42 baget -> braun
I'll take it and use it.

2020-06-24T15:07:56 baget -> braun
For me, this is the second level of abstraction.

2020-06-24T15:08:16 baget -> braun
There's no interpretation there at all.

2020-06-24T15:08:42 braun -> baget
I need the locker to create a link to the landing using the encrypted group name

2020-06-24T15:09:12 braun -> baget
This is if the locker has no connection to the server

2020-06-24T15:09:17 baget -> braun
Loker? A link?

2020-06-24T15:09:42 baget -> braun
What are you talking about?

2020-06-24T15:10:21 braun -> baget
We need to create a link to register the bot with the link.

Of this form: crypto.onion/<group_name>/<cid_bot>

2020-06-24T15:10:54 baget -> braun
Wait a minute, you already have it!

2020-06-24T15:11:13 baget -> braun
Or I don't get it...

2020-06-24T15:11:19 braun -> baget
Yes, provided there is a connection to the server

2020-06-24T15:11:25 braun -> baget
And if there isn't one.

2020-06-24T15:11:30 baget -> braun
Tho?

2020-06-24T15:11:41 braun -> baget
The bot won't get the link to the linking page

2020-06-24T15:11:50 baget -> braun
Why?

2020-06-24T15:12:12 baget -> braun
You can sew the landing page right into the body of the echo.

2020-06-24T15:13:40 baget -> braun
Bilder has it all.

2020-06-24T15:13:53 baget -> braun
Or didn't I get it all?

2020-06-24T15:14:30 braun -> baget
Exe will be used for N bots, and we need each bot to have its own landing page. If the bot is not a group bot

2020-06-24T15:15:07 baget -> braun
Damn! So for a non-group bot, you call a builder every time!

2020-06-24T15:15:31 baget -> braun
Throw in different pages from different files!

2020-06-24T15:15:42 braun -> baget
Meaning?

2020-06-24T15:15:45 baget -> braun
How do you want to automate this?

2020-06-24T15:16:07 baget -> braun
Brown.

2020-06-24T15:16:10 baget -> braun
Darling.

2020-06-24T15:16:22 baget -> braun
See how the builder works.

2020-06-24T15:16:44 baget -> braun
he has both a locale and a network.

2020-06-24T15:17:00 baget -> braun
Or did I misunderstand something?

2020-06-24T15:17:38 braun -> baget
If the locker doesn't have access to the network, it takes the settings sewn into it. Right?

2020-06-24T15:17:52 baget -> braun
Absolutely.

2020-06-24T15:20:14 braun -> baget
Here, each bot if the target is not a group should get an individual link to the landing page.

If we write the setting once when forming the target, we cannot configure this link

2020-06-24T15:20:38 braun -> baget
Then you need a different locker for each bot

2020-06-24T15:20:50 baget -> braun
Right.

2020-06-24T15:20:59 baget -> braun
What's the problem?

2020-06-24T15:21:16 baget -> braun
Loker and prepared like this...

2020-06-24T15:21:24 baget -> braun
It's in the TOR.

2020-06-24T15:22:50 braun -> baget
We need to add the ability to generate a custom landing page to this logic.

And this is different logic, I'm trying to unify the task somehow)

2020-06-24T15:23:49 braun -> baget
Right now, everything is fine, as long as the server is bouncing. And if it's not there, we lose the victim.

2020-06-24T15:24:03 baget -> braun
Are you kidding me?) Do you need an algorithm?:-)

2020-06-24T15:24:30 baget -> braun
Brown, darling, take a rest....

2020-06-24T15:24:38 baget -> braun
It's work that's killing the horses.

2020-06-24T15:24:49 braun -> baget
Yep

2020-06-24T15:24:58 baget -> braun
Did you understand what you wrote?

2020-06-24T15:25:15 baget -> braun
So you have everything for the network, but not for local?

2020-06-24T15:25:33 baget -> braun
What are you smoking?:-) Share!!!

2020-06-24T15:25:47 braun -> baget
For the locale is there, but not all)

2020-06-24T15:25:53 braun -> baget
I overheated:D

2020-06-24T15:26:09 baget -> braun
I believe.

2020-06-25T09:54:36 braun -> baget
Hi, bro)

2020-06-25T09:55:12 baget -> braun
Hi.

2020-06-25T09:55:22 braun -> baget
How are you doing? Did the thunderstorm hit you hard?

2020-06-25T09:55:55 baget -> braun
No damage :-)

2020-06-25T09:56:25 baget -> braun
At least your head splits in half...

2020-06-25T09:57:09 baget -> braun
Had to take a painkiller.

2020-06-25T10:01:57 braun -> baget
wow...where does it hurt? in your scales, the back of your head, or your scrotum?

2020-06-25T10:02:40 baget -> braun
Above and Beyond the Eyes.

2020-06-25T10:03:07 braun -> baget
Tension because of the eyes(

2020-06-25T10:03:46 baget -> braun
(

2020-06-25T10:04:03 braun -> baget
Gotta rest, bro)

2020-06-25T10:04:19 braun -> baget
I gave it a hard time yesterday) I'm still recovering from it...

2020-06-25T10:04:36 baget -> braun
Meaning?

2020-06-25T10:05:13 baget -> braun
What happened? :-)

2020-06-25T10:05:35 braun -> baget
Yes, I told you something a little wrong yesterday)

2020-06-25T10:05:54 baget -> braun
It happens... :-)

2020-06-25T10:06:07 braun -> baget
But closed his task.

2020-06-25T10:06:47 braun -> baget
A hint: I take it the locker does not work with the file linking in any way?

2020-06-25T10:07:05 baget -> braun
No. No way.

2020-06-25T10:07:36 braun -> baget
We need to fix this)

2020-06-25T10:07:41 braun -> baget
Can you do it?

2020-06-25T10:07:51 baget -> braun
Sure.

2020-06-25T10:07:57 baget -> braun
Elementary.

2020-06-25T10:08:05 baget -> braun
Say what you need.

2020-06-25T10:08:52 braun -> baget
Look at the text link in the landing page, for example this link http://enigma.onion/sdfeGGsdee2123/<idbot>

2020-06-25T10:10:00 braun -> baget
You need to do this, if the file has <idbot>, then replace it with the CID bot (for example from this CID: HOSTNAME-USER_A.50f176b73f062d57515ccba802077890, we take all data after the point => 50f176b73f062d57515ccba802077890)

2020-06-25T10:10:14 baget -> braun
ok

2020-06-25T10:11:11 braun -> baget
This is if there is no connection to the server, and if there is a connection to the server. Then we take the data from the admin panel and do not change anything

2020-06-25T10:11:55 braun -> baget
Thank you.

2020-06-25T10:11:59 braun -> baget
When will you do it?

2020-06-25T10:12:16 baget -> braun
I'll do it when my head gets loose.

2020-06-25T10:13:09 braun -> baget
Okay, take a break then ;)

2020-06-25T19:05:12 braun -> baget
Evening)

2020-06-25T19:05:30 braun -> baget
Not done with the locker yet?

2020-06-26T06:22:00 baget -> braun
Hi.

2020-06-28T12:14:34 baget -> braun
Here

2020-06-28T12:14:36 baget -> braun
?

2020-06-28T12:15:35 baget -> braun
Hi!

2020-06-28T13:36:58 braun -> baget
Hi)

2020-06-28T13:37:02 braun -> baget
Yes, here)

2020-06-28T13:37:13 braun -> baget
Aren't you already?

2020-06-28T13:50:14 baget -> braun
Oops, didn't expect that.

2020-06-28T13:50:19 baget -> braun
Snooze.

2020-06-28T13:50:24 braun -> baget
=)

2020-06-28T13:50:32 braun -> baget
How's your weather?

2020-06-28T13:50:32 baget -> braun
We are very hot.

2020-06-28T13:50:46 baget -> braun
Very, very.

2020-06-28T13:50:48 braun -> baget
You're predicting my questions)

2020-06-28T13:50:57 baget -> braun
Yes, I know.

2020-06-28T13:50:58 braun -> baget
Is the sea warm?

2020-06-28T13:51:06 baget -> braun
I don't know.

2020-06-28T13:51:11 baget -> braun
They say yes.

2020-06-28T13:51:19 braun -> baget
We should go)

2020-06-28T13:51:35 braun -> baget
We want to go to your neighborhoods)

2020-06-28T13:51:42 baget -> braun
I plunged into the pool and was fine.

2020-06-28T13:52:12 braun -> baget
Awesome.

2020-06-28T13:52:19 baget -> braun
Well, you're welcome.

2020-06-28T13:52:28 baget -> braun
Come.

2020-06-28T13:52:47 baget -> braun
We'll help you and show you and tell you.

2020-06-28T13:52:52 braun -> baget
What's the deal with the passage? They say it doesn't pass Sebastopol?

2020-06-28T13:53:01 baget -> braun
That's a yes.

2020-06-28T13:53:06 braun -> baget
:D

2020-06-28T13:53:10 baget -> braun
But, until July 1.

2020-06-28T13:53:23 braun -> baget
Okay then)

2020-06-28T13:53:33 baget -> braun
Dude, we have nothing to catch in July and August.

2020-06-28T13:53:41 braun -> baget
Why?

2020-06-28T13:54:02 braun -> baget
A lot of people?

2020-06-28T13:54:07 baget -> braun
It's hot. It's stuffy. Sweaty. People are fucked up. Prices to shit.

2020-06-28T13:54:25 braun -> baget
So we have to go in September.

2020-06-28T13:54:31 baget -> braun
And here's from the 20th of September.

2020-06-28T13:54:40 baget -> braun
That's right, it's like heaven.

2020-06-28T13:54:45 braun -> baget
Well then, it's already cool, isn't it?

2020-06-28T13:55:12 baget -> braun
Water temperature equals air temperature...+25...+27

2020-06-28T13:55:25 braun -> baget
Awesome.

2020-06-28T13:55:39 baget -> braun
Evenings are filled with incredible smells.

2020-06-28T13:55:50 braun -> baget
So you have to plan for that time.

2020-06-28T13:55:51 baget -> braun
The flowers of September are blooming...

2020-06-28T13:56:05 braun -> baget
You tell it like that, that's where we'll stay)))

2020-06-28T13:56:32 baget -> braun
Very nice. Very expensive.

2020-06-28T13:56:38 baget -> braun
Do you have any real estate?

2020-06-28T13:56:47 baget -> braun
In the Crimea?

2020-06-28T13:56:49 braun -> baget
-

2020-06-28T13:57:06 braun -> baget
Not yet, but we're thinking about it.

2020-06-28T13:57:10 baget -> braun
Then you won't stay.

2020-06-28T13:57:26 baget -> braun
Think fast.

2020-06-28T13:57:44 braun -> baget
Now we launch cryptolocker and we can buy the Crimea))))

2020-06-28T13:57:45 baget -> braun
Soon there will be nothing left to buy.

2020-06-28T13:57:52 braun -> baget
Is everyone taking everything apart?

2020-06-28T13:58:03 baget -> braun
Cleanly.

2020-06-28T13:58:27 baget -> braun
They charged me $2,000 for my house.

2020-06-28T13:58:43 braun -> baget
Nice house?

2020-06-28T13:59:09 baget -> braun
Yes. And there is a lot of land. And the site boundary with the reserve.

2020-06-28T13:59:26 baget -> braun
No one can build next to you)

2020-06-28T13:59:44 baget -> braun
So I told you to fuck off.

2020-06-28T13:59:55 braun -> baget
That's understandable)

2020-06-28T14:00:06 braun -> baget
Is there anything nearby for sale?

2020-06-28T14:00:32 baget -> braun
Check. Grandma Nina died in May, God rest her soul.

2020-06-28T14:00:40 baget -> braun
Her house is on the market.

2020-06-28T14:01:23 baget -> braun
There's another one nearby.

2020-06-28T14:01:35 baget -> braun
Except no one has bought one yet.

2020-06-28T14:01:41 baget -> braun
No money...))

2020-06-28T14:03:15 braun -> baget
How much is it?

2020-06-28T14:03:24 braun -> baget
How much is it?

2020-06-28T14:03:25 baget -> braun
5

2020-06-28T14:03:41 baget -> braun
But, it's in rubles.

2020-06-28T14:03:58 braun -> baget
And yours was valued at $

2020-06-28T14:03:59 braun -> baget
=)

2020-06-28T14:04:04 baget -> braun
Yes.

2020-06-28T14:04:10 baget -> braun
Is that funny?

2020-06-28T14:04:39 baget -> braun
I have my own water, my own garden, my own vegetable garden.

2020-06-28T14:04:57 baget -> braun
Planning to put a bank of solar panels this year...

2020-06-28T14:05:21 baget -> braun
Earth is ...

2020-06-28T14:05:37 baget -> braun
And in Crimea, this is the most important thing.

2020-06-28T14:06:17 braun -> baget
No, it's funny that I didn't get it right away!

2020-06-28T14:06:53 baget -> braun
А! You thought it was two million in rubles???

2020-06-28T14:07:10 baget -> braun
Nah, I don't live in a dog house :-)

2020-06-28T14:07:47 baget -> braun
Mine wasn't rated either.

2020-06-28T14:08:12 baget -> braun
The low-ranking majors are here, and they're here to pussyfoot around.

2020-06-28T14:08:21 baget -> braun
From the suburbs...

2020-06-28T14:08:36 baget -> braun
As they came, so they went.

2020-06-28T14:08:57 baget -> braun
Nah, very cultured, heartfelt...

2020-06-28T14:09:21 baget -> braun
Proved that for this money you can buy a lot of things!:-)

2020-06-28T14:09:27 baget -> braun
This is the truth.

2020-06-28T14:09:54 baget -> braun
Except that the loss is disproportionate.

2020-06-28T14:10:02 baget -> braun
But, you come!

2020-06-28T14:10:07 baget -> braun
Let's get drunk!

2020-06-28T14:10:20 baget -> braun
It's my birthday on July 29.

2020-06-28T14:12:24 braun -> baget
Absolutely, though I don't use, but I can be supportive.

2020-06-28T14:13:23 braun -> baget
I'll be gone for about 40 minutes, we'll talk afterwards.

In general, Muscovites are like that, it's good that they did not squeeze. Otherwise it happens!

What I wanted to say...

2020-06-28T14:37:12 baget -> braun
Your task is finished.

2020-06-28T14:37:31 baget -> braun
Yeah, sorry to drag it out.

2020-06-28T14:38:13 baget -> braun
I had some very unpleasant problems on the main line here.

2020-06-28T14:39:02 baget -> braun
If it's not too much trouble, you put these tasks to me in our new mechanism:-)

We're just finishing up. We need your refinements.

2020-06-28T16:18:24 braun -> baget
I will set a task

2020-06-28T16:22:01 braun -> baget
we need to turn it in already!

2020-06-28T16:23:02 braun -> baget
Look I will check, if everything is ok, you will need to clean the locker of detects.

2020-06-28T17:31:35 braun -> baget
Will you throw in the build?

2020-06-29T08:46:04 braun -> baget
Hey there, buddy!

2020-06-29T08:47:42 baget -> braun

2020-06-29T08:48:08 braun -> baget
Ready to get to work?

2020-06-29T08:48:21 baget -> braun
Of course.

2020-06-29T08:49:05 braun -> baget
You haven't done the locker yet or are you all set?

Or was there something else there?

2020-06-29T08:51:57 braun -> baget
Didn't you add path handling ../../?
If not, you don't have to. I've fine-tuned my script, and it all works in the end.

I was afraid that php would not send a big line to the shell.

2020-06-29T10:19:31 braun -> baget
Bro, will you send me the build today?

2020-06-29T10:20:00 baget -> braun
О!

2020-06-29T10:20:05 baget -> braun
Yes, of course.

2020-06-29T13:46:01 braun -> baget
When I specify in build.bat
like this:: builderforlocker.exe 173.232.146.12 tstgrp proc.txt serv.txt rfiles.txt wfiles.txt dfiles.txt ffiles.txt lpage.txt "with:\LockerRes\task1\"

"c:\LockerRes\task1\" <- If I specify this, it does not see this folder and shoves the created locker\unlocker files to c:\LockerRes\

"c:\LockerRes\task1" <- If I specify this, it sees the folder and puts the created locker\unlocker files here

If I write it without quotation marks it's ok (e.g. c:\LockerRes\task1\), but if there are spaces in the path, the script will not work.

2020-06-29T13:49:43 braun -> baget
Further, when encrypting one file via unlocker, the same situation happens.
For example: unlocker.exe "c:\file\2539.jpg.lock64" c:\file\data\

c:\file\data\ < If this is the parameter, it decrypts fine. But it doesn't move it to the folder

"c:\file\data\" < If this parameter, it decrypts and moves to the folder, but the file name will be "restore"

2020-06-29T13:52:43 baget -> braun
Right.

2020-06-29T13:58:43 baget -> braun
 If such a parameter, it decrypts and moves to the folder, but the file name will be "restore"

2020-06-29T13:58:48 baget -> braun
That's right.

2020-06-29T13:58:53 baget -> braun
That's the way it's meant to be.

2020-06-29T14:00:14 baget -> braun
"c:\LockerRes\task1\" <- If I specify this, it does not see this folder and shoves the created locker\unlocker files into c:\LockerRes\

2020-06-29T14:00:21 baget -> braun
How's that???

2020-06-29T14:00:50 baget -> braun
Clarify for clarity. Slash?

2020-06-29T14:01:16 baget -> braun
Right.

2020-06-29T14:04:52 baget -> braun
Wait, you got me confused.

2020-06-29T14:05:36 baget -> braun
"c:\LockerRes\task1\" <- If I specify this, it doesn't see this folder and shoves the created locker\unlocker files into c:\LockerRes\
That can't be right.

2020-06-29T14:06:31 baget -> braun
In the code is SetCurrentDirectory(...)

2020-06-29T14:06:43 baget -> braun
And nothing else.

2020-06-29T14:07:09 braun -> baget
strange, I'm looking at it again.

2020-06-29T14:07:39 baget -> braun
Check it out, of course.

2020-06-29T14:08:10 baget -> braun
But this com string parameter is taken and sent to the above function. ALL!!!

2020-06-29T14:08:29 baget -> braun
There can be no mistake...

2020-06-29T14:09:53 baget -> braun
Waiting.

2020-06-29T14:10:45 braun -> baget
as it is

2020-06-29T14:11:00 baget -> braun
Holy shit...

2020-06-29T14:11:57 braun -> baget
If I specify "with:\LockerRes\task1\" -> moves to where the build is
If I specify "with:\LockerRes\task1\" -> moves it to the folder.

2020-06-29T14:16:38 braun -> baget
[16:49:42] <Braun> Next, when encrypting one file via unlocker, the same situation happens.
For example: unlocker.exe "c:\file\2539.jpg.lock64" c:\file\data\

1) - c:\file\data\ < If this parameter, it decrypts normally. But it doesn't move it to the folder

2) - "c:\file\data\" < If this parameter, it decrypts and moves to the folder, but the file name will be "restore"

2020-06-29T14:18:35 baget -> braun
Nope.

2020-06-29T14:18:40 baget -> braun
Wait a minute...

2020-06-29T14:19:32 baget -> braun
In the bat file, the "\" construct is not appropriate at all.

2020-06-29T14:19:56 baget -> braun
If that's what you want to do, write \"

2020-06-29T14:20:40 braun -> baget
That's right.

2020-06-29T14:20:47 braun -> baget
That's the problem.

2020-06-29T14:20:50 baget -> braun
Otherwise, you assign a control character.

2020-06-29T14:21:08 baget -> braun

2020-06-29T14:26:03 baget -> braun
Then you need to do a signature analysis.

2020-06-29T14:26:28 baget -> braun

Absolutely.

Studio 10 has one thing wrong with it. With resource upgrades...

2020-06-29T15:07:09 baget -> braun
You need to rebuild the whole solution there.

2020-06-29T15:07:21 baget -> braun

2020-06-29T15:07:51 baget -> braun
Otherwise, the studio leaves the old resource inside the builder's body...

That's a nice nuance, I didn't know about that.

2020-06-29T15:09:15 baget -> braun

You have to do a solushin rebuild.

2020-06-29T15:34:17 baget -> braun

2020-06-29T15:35:26 braun -> baget
These files: proc.txt serv.txt rfiles.txt wfiles.txt dfiles.txt ffiles.txt lpage.txt

I have php generates, I set them the full path and create the locker through the build

2020-06-29T15:35:39 baget -> braun
И?

2020-06-29T15:36:54 braun -> baget
So for some reason, they do not work do not register in the locker. I do not understand why.

2020-06-29T15:37:24 baget -> braun
Look... You may have fiddling with relative and absolute paths in php

2020-06-29T16:41:41 braun -> baget
I've written a couple of times such a TOR, it's very time consuming!

2020-06-29T16:42:04 baget -> braun
If you wrote for idiots, making it clear, then yes.

2020-06-29T16:42:05 braun -> baget
But the development process is faster, I agree wholeheartedly!

2020-06-29T16:42:45 baget -> braun
But for cryptolocker to create terms of reference, which will fit in two weeks... At most, 10...12 days

2020-06-29T16:42:59 baget -> braun
Okay, that's with working out the likely solutions.

2020-06-29T16:44:03 braun -> baget
I have enough for my ToS, good diagram, descriptions of links and examples of implementations.

2020-06-29T16:45:04 baget -> braun
In our case, a description of the exchange protocols is sufficient. Specifically.

2020-06-29T16:45:16 baget -> braun
With all the quotes and spaces and stuff.

2020-06-29T16:45:39 braun -> baget
That's right.

2020-06-29T16:45:52 baget -> braun
Take any protocol RFC.

2020-06-29T16:46:41 baget -> braun
UDP, for example:-)

2020-06-29T16:46:51 baget -> braun
Total bullshit, and 20 pages.

2020-06-29T16:47:11 baget -> braun
Or IPCP, as an option. Even funnier.

2020-06-29T16:51:58 braun -> baget
A good description = the key to success. It's worth learning.

2020-06-29T16:52:36 baget -> braun
Serious companies have taskmasters.

2020-06-29T16:53:11 baget -> braun
Proffesionals who create tasks for departments.

2020-06-29T16:53:32 baget -> braun
These people are worth their weight in gold:-)

2020-06-29T16:53:59 baget -> braun
And what is characteristic, I have not met anyone younger than 40.

2020-06-29T16:54:22 baget -> braun
Knowledge is knowledge and experience is experience.

2020-06-29T16:54:54 braun -> baget
So, of course, you need experience for this kind of thing!

2020-06-29T16:56:27 braun -> baget
Bro do pliz variant ;

2020-06-29T16:56:44 baget -> braun
Why?

2020-06-29T16:56:51 baget -> braun
No, I'll do it.

2020-06-29T16:56:57 baget -> braun
I'll add a line...

2020-06-29T16:57:07 baget -> braun
You could do it yourself...:-)

2020-06-29T17:05:03 braun -> baget
It's okay.

2020-06-29T17:05:17 braun -> baget
It's a pain in the ass with these \r\n.

2020-06-29T17:07:06 braun -> baget
Once did a processing of text manufacturing specifications, there were a lot of special characters there. I had so much fun it still makes my eye twitch)))

2020-06-29T17:15:28 baget -> braun
Right:-)

2020-06-29T17:25:47 braun -> baget
Nah, one wins, the other doesn't!

Please do it through ; it's safer that way.

2020-06-29T17:26:18 baget -> braun
Yeah, whatever you say.

2020-06-29T17:26:31 baget -> braun
No problem.

2020-06-29T17:26:37 braun -> baget
Thanks

2020-06-29T17:26:59 baget -> braun
What, you can't use \n?:-)

2020-06-29T17:27:13 braun -> baget
It's kicking for some reason.

2020-06-29T17:27:22 baget -> braun
With what?

2020-06-29T17:27:58 braun -> baget
I did, but the locker won't accept. Changing through notepad, everything works!

2020-06-29T17:28:30 baget -> braun
Cut.

2020-06-29T17:28:57 baget -> braun
Did you put in the first two bytes 0xFF0xFE?

2020-06-29T17:29:16 braun -> baget
No)

2020-06-29T17:29:29 baget -> braun
Protocol, my friend.

2020-06-29T17:29:46 braun -> baget
Holy shit)

2020-06-29T17:29:53 baget -> braun
How do you sign a UNICOD file?

2020-06-29T17:29:58 baget -> braun
That's right...

2020-06-29T17:32:54 braun -> baget
I have UTF8 It does everything

2020-06-29T17:33:22 braun -> baget
You have a UCS-2 LE BOM

2020-06-29T17:35:48 braun -> baget
What a challenge you've come up with for me)
Why didn't you tell me right away, I'm all covered in sweat here)

2020-06-29T18:01:45 baget -> braun
That wasn't me.

2020-06-29T18:01:59 baget -> braun
This is the standard of the winda.

2020-06-29T18:02:41 baget -> braun
Windows handles all text that way.

2020-06-29T18:03:03 baget -> braun
Everything else is just an intermediate conversion.

2020-06-29T18:04:28 baget -> braun
If you look carefully, the unicode string functions are hardwired into the kernel, and all others are implemented through libraries.

2020-06-29T18:05:42 baget -> braun
And I said all this. Back in January.

2020-06-29T18:06:01 baget -> braun
When describing the functionality.

2020-06-29T18:11:46 braun -> baget
Oh man, without information is like without hands.

2020-06-29T18:12:14 baget -> braun
Now you know everything:-)

2020-06-29T18:12:27 braun -> baget
Now yes)

2020-06-29T18:12:41 baget -> braun
Well, as an aside, you had to go that route yourself...

2020-06-29T18:13:33 baget -> braun
You have the task of rejecting libraries.:-)

2020-06-29T18:13:43 baget -> braun
And the kernel only has unicode.

2020-06-29T18:14:03 baget -> braun
Even the system drivers are only on this.

2020-06-29T18:14:29 baget -> braun
But, they almost have Pascal there...:-)

2020-06-29T18:14:50 baget -> braun
There are 4 bytes at the beginning describing the length of the string.

2020-06-29T18:15:01 baget -> braun
In pascal, it's 2.

2020-06-29T18:46:49 braun -> baget
All done.
Thanks for the tip buddy.

2020-06-29T19:15:03 baget -> braun
My bad.

2020-06-29T19:15:09 baget -> braun
Which one?

2020-06-29T19:15:48 baget -> braun
You don't care about the kernel in php...

2020-06-29T19:16:27 baget -> braun
You're isolated.

2020-06-29T20:25:43 braun -> baget
[22:16:27] <baget (locker)> You are isolated.
> that's right. It's different here than in C++.

2020-06-29T20:26:32 braun -> baget
[22:15:09] <baget (locker)> For what?
> What is the problem with the coding...

2020-06-30T06:51:58 braun -> baget
[22:16:27] <baget (locker)> You are isolated.

2020-06-30T06:51:58 braun -> baget
[22:15:09] <baget (locker)> For what?
> What is the coding problem...

2020-06-30T09:47:35 baget -> braun
Hi!

2020-06-30T09:53:58 braun -> baget
Hi

2020-06-30T09:54:23 baget -> braun
Buddy, what's up with you and Kevin?

2020-06-30T09:54:54 baget -> braun
[10:39:00] <Kevin> braun wanted to demonstrate how everything works. nothing started. by locker... desktop doesn't change, emails don't appear on desktop...
[10:39:34] <Kevin> I would have loved to run the process myself a long time ago, but it's all raw
[10:40:39] <Kevin> and we communicated with buzzer by locker, not with baget...
[10:40:57] <Kevin> booza, as far as I understand, dumped everything on Braun.

2020-06-30T09:54:54 braun -> baget
What about him?

2020-06-30T09:55:16 baget -> braun
Stern discounted this to me with indignation :-)

2020-06-30T09:55:32 braun -> baget
Hz)

2020-06-30T09:55:37 braun -> baget
He didn't write me anything.

2020-06-30T09:56:03 baget -> braun
[12:36:02] <Stern> and who tested it?
[12:36:09] <baget> braun.
[12:36:22] <Stern> on what systems?
[12:36:26] <Stern> inside cor networks
[12:36:28] <Stern> corp etc.
[12:36:35] <Stern> send me the test report
[12:36:37] <Stern> on av too
[12:36:49] <baget> Dobro.
[12:36:57] <baget> I'll check with Brown and send it.

2020-06-30T09:56:10 baget -> braun
Here, to clarify.

2020-06-30T09:56:47 braun -> baget
You and I have finalized everything with the locker.

2020-06-30T09:56:49 baget -> braun
And in fact, so as not to be a transmitter, you would have written to him.

2020-06-30T09:56:56 braun -> baget
Ok

2020-06-30T09:56:59 baget -> braun
I mean Stern.

2020-06-30T09:57:15 baget -> braun
Otherwise, it's kind of ugly.

2020-06-30T09:58:19 braun -> baget
You're required to clean the detects from the locker and put it into combat mode. With the ability to self-delete when the job is done.

2020-06-30T09:58:49 baget -> braun
no problem.

2020-06-30T10:09:37 baget -> braun
Well, I guess that's settled:-)

2020-06-30T10:10:28 braun -> baget
Yeah, I guess)

2020-06-30T10:10:37 braun -> baget
I don't understand why they all flew to you)

2020-06-30T10:10:50 baget -> braun
And you weren't online...

2020-06-30T10:11:19 baget -> braun
I think, okay... I'll work as a transmitter, what to do...:-)

2020-06-30T10:11:41 baget -> braun
But, I'm really glad I didn't have to! :-D

2020-06-30T10:11:51 braun -> baget
Good)

2020-06-30T10:15:42 braun -> baget
They want to infect the company's network with the locker

2020-06-30T10:15:51 braun -> baget
Is it possible with a locker?

2020-06-30T10:16:02 braun -> baget
more precisely provided for?

2020-06-30T10:16:27 baget -> braun
How's that?

2020-06-30T10:17:55 braun -> baget
I take it to scan available computers on the network and encrypt, not really understood yet.

2020-06-30T10:18:07 baget -> braun
Yeah, me too.

2020-06-30T10:26:59 braun -> baget
Get what they want?)

2020-06-30T10:27:11 baget -> braun
Yes.

2020-06-30T10:27:18 baget -> braun
Thank you.

2020-06-30T10:27:24 baget -> braun
I'll do it now.

2020-06-30T10:28:03 braun -> baget
Then tell me the logic, how should it work?

2020-06-30T10:28:13 baget -> braun
ok

2020-07-01T08:50:31 braun -> baget
Hey there, buddy!

2020-07-01T08:51:11 baget -> braun
!!!

2020-07-01T08:51:38 braun -> baget
Busy?

2020-07-01T08:51:50 baget -> braun
say

2020-07-01T08:52:47 braun -> baget
Tell me, we are now writing ip address in the locker, if I specify the domain. Everything will work the same, right?

2020-07-01T08:53:10 baget -> braun
no.

2020-07-01T08:53:17 baget -> braun
not at all.

2020-07-01T08:54:29 baget -> braun
there's only an ip.

2020-07-01T09:02:00 braun -> baget
ok

2020-07-02T10:27:16 braun -> baget
Hey bro!

2020-07-02T10:27:30 braun -> baget
How's it going for you?

2020-07-02T10:27:32 baget -> braun
Hi

2020-07-02T10:28:31 baget -> braun
busy backdoor.

2020-07-02T10:28:46 baget -> braun
I was already hit on by Boosa yesterday...

2020-07-02T10:29:07 braun -> baget
About?

2020-07-02T10:29:24 baget -> braun
I still can't pass.

2020-07-02T10:29:41 baget -> braun
There's a day's work, and there's always something in the way

2020-07-02T10:29:59 braun -> baget
on backdoor?

2020-07-02T10:30:11 baget -> braun
yes

2020-07-02T10:30:34 braun -> baget
I got it, please write me when you're done.

2020-07-02T10:30:45 baget -> braun
ok

2020-07-02T10:30:56 braun -> baget
You didn't do a network locker, did you?

2020-07-02T10:31:17 baget -> braun
Watched it yesterday.

2020-07-02T10:31:22 baget -> braun
Will do.

2020-07-02T10:31:30 baget -> braun
It's not complicated there.

2020-07-02T10:31:38 braun -> baget
ok

2020-07-02T10:32:01 braun -> baget
As you do, you need to clean up the blanks and give it to the test

2020-07-02T10:32:07 braun -> baget
If everything is ok, let's run it!

2020-07-02T10:32:13 baget -> braun
ok

2020-07-03T13:20:08 braun -> baget
Hey bro!

2020-07-03T13:20:37 baget -> braun
Hi.

2020-07-03T13:20:53 braun -> baget
How are you doing?

2020-07-03T13:21:05 braun -> baget
Are you being attacked there?

2020-07-03T13:22:17 baget -> braun
Oddly enough, no.

2020-07-03T13:22:31 braun -> baget
Awesome.

2020-07-03T13:22:55 braun -> baget
What did you decide with kevin :

[13:32:18] <Braun> The network encryption parameter should be taken separately when creating a target? I.e. should we make this function disabled or leave it on always?

2020-07-03T13:23:23 baget -> braun
There was no talk about that.

2020-07-03T13:23:45 braun -> baget
What was it about?

2020-07-03T13:23:52 braun -> baget
I didn't get it at the time.

2020-07-03T13:24:12 baget -> braun
Discussed the scanner. Discussed the synchronization issue.

2020-07-03T13:24:43 baget -> braun
The encryption parameter was not considered.

2020-07-03T13:25:12 baget -> braun
I'm not quite sure what encryption parameter we're talking about...

2020-07-03T13:25:56 braun -> baget
Meaning the encryption of an open balloon at the victim

2020-07-03T13:26:32 baget -> braun
Why take it out somewhere?

2020-07-03T13:29:43 braun -> baget
thought to disable or enable this function to reduce the number of operations in the locker.

I take it this does not affect the speed of the locker?

2020-07-03T13:30:02 baget -> braun
No, not much.

2020-07-03T13:30:17 braun -> baget
no problem then.

2020-07-03T13:37:51 braun -> baget
I was sent a question on locker, which of these items work in locker?
[15:35:44] <Miguel> which of these is done? and can I add what isn't:
1 - Port scanner by local subnets, finds all DFS, SMB, WebDav balloons,
2 - Set file permissions and remove blocking attributes,
3 - Removing shadow copies, cleaning logs,
4 - Mounting hidden partitions, drag'n'drop files and folders.
5 - The work is performed stealthily in offline mode, the presence of the Internet is not required.
6 - The hidden mode of the locker, should not hang in processes in plain sight.
7 - When new hard disks/flashes/network disks/etc. are connected, the cryptolocker starts working on them in separate threads, and if new files appear, they will also be encrypted.

________
I take it you are now busy with point 1.

2020-07-03T13:39:21 baget -> braun
Have you lost your mind?

2020-07-03T13:39:39 baget -> braun
That's three different projects!!!

2020-07-03T13:39:50 baget -> braun
Yes, point 1

2020-07-03T13:40:01 baget -> braun
You want to put it all in the locker???

2020-07-03T13:40:38 baget -> braun
No, it's possible in principle, but we won't be able to take off...

2020-07-03T13:42:05 braun -> baget
Point 3: We have deletion working, let them specify which formats and folders to delete. And that would work, right?

2020-07-03T13:42:18 baget -> braun
Yes.

2020-07-03T13:42:18 braun -> baget
Paragraph 5 works as it is

2020-07-03T13:42:48 braun -> baget
Point 6 needs to be done.

2020-07-03T13:43:08 braun -> baget
Item 7: Does the locker scan the entire pc? all connected disks?

2020-07-03T13:43:18 baget -> braun
Yes.

2020-07-03T13:43:49 baget -> braun
Okay, now let's see if we can't figure out how to do this better.

2020-07-03T13:43:50 braun -> baget
Well, that's okay then.

2020-07-03T13:44:51 braun -> baget
7 points, I explained to them that the locker will work once and delete. It would not hang in the system. They were fine with it!

2020-07-03T13:45:14 baget -> braun
fine.

2020-07-03T13:45:36 braun -> baget
points 2 and 4 it is not very clear what to do with it

2020-07-03T13:45:48 baget -> braun
I'll think about it.

2020-07-03T13:46:24 braun -> baget
Right now they are worried about points 1 and 6

2020-07-03T13:47:19 baget -> braun
I'm fiddling with 1, but this is new to me. I need to read it.

2020-07-03T13:49:14 braun -> baget
ok

2020-07-03T13:51:51 braun -> baget
Another question: will locker encrypt hidden folders and disks?

2020-07-03T13:52:03 baget -> braun
Yes.

2020-07-03T13:52:13 braun -> baget
good

2020-07-03T13:52:15 baget -> braun
He's the one who sees everything.

2020-07-03T14:22:56 braun -> baget
How about raising the startup rights, shouldn't the locker be responsible for that?

On point 2: Increase the rights to the folder/file (of course, other than the system) can you do?

I talked and item 4 became unimportant.

2020-07-03T14:23:34 baget -> braun
It's been around somewhere...

2020-07-03T14:23:58 baget -> braun
Although...

2020-07-03T14:24:16 baget -> braun
It's one thing to raise permissions on locales and quite another to raise permissions on the network...

2020-07-03T14:24:38 baget -> braun
Hmm. I have to think.

2020-07-03T14:25:09 braun -> baget
ok

2020-07-06T09:49:20 baget -> braun
Hi!

2020-07-06T09:49:28 baget -> braun
Buddy, are you there?

2020-07-06T09:59:14 baget -> braun
If you show up, please knock.

2020-07-06T10:01:40 braun -> baget
Hi

2020-07-06T10:01:58 braun -> baget
Buddy, I'm right here!

2020-07-06T10:02:11 baget -> braun
Rad.

2020-07-06T10:02:39 baget -> braun
Don't we have a server with WebDAV somewhere?

2020-07-06T10:03:06 braun -> baget
Oops, I dunno)

2020-07-06T10:03:09 baget -> braun
The task is quite cloudy...

2020-07-06T10:03:18 braun -> baget
Defender should be asked.

2020-07-06T10:03:26 baget -> braun
Already. So he's not saying anything.

2020-07-06T10:03:39 braun -> baget
More geeen

2020-07-06T10:03:52 baget -> braun
Grynya to pull?

2020-07-06T10:03:58 braun -> baget
+

2020-07-06T10:04:07 baget -> braun
Grynya is also possible...

2020-07-06T10:04:46 baget -> braun
Man, this add on crypting files in balls, it's really two separate projects.

2020-07-06T10:05:11 braun -> baget
That wasn't the goal in the first place!

2020-07-06T10:05:19 baget -> braun
Separate for SMB/DFS and separate for DAV

2020-07-06T10:05:43 baget -> braun
I know that...:-)

2020-07-06T10:05:58 baget -> braun
It wasn't. It didn't make it any easier.

2020-07-06T10:06:13 braun -> baget
That's right.

2020-07-06T10:06:35 braun -> baget
I don't really have an idea of the whole balloon encryption scheme right now.

2020-07-06T10:07:34 braun -> baget
They can also be closed for recording, how do you know the user of the balloons under which you can record!?

2020-07-06T10:08:16 baget -> braun
Well, for SMB it's one thing, for DFS it's another, DAV I don't know at all...

2020-07-06T10:09:32 baget -> braun
With DFS - there are kilos of code with these domains...

2020-07-06T10:10:14 baget -> braun
Frankly, the task is not for the faint of heart.

2020-07-06T10:11:19 braun -> baget
I'm afraid to even imagine it!

2020-07-06T10:13:41 baget -> braun
Well, there's not much to be afraid of... But you'll have to tap on the keys.

2020-07-07T11:26:32 baget -> braun
Hi.

2020-07-07T11:26:35 baget -> braun
Are you here?

2020-07-07T11:40:14 braun -> baget
Hi.

2020-07-07T11:40:14 braun -> baget
Are you here?

2020-07-08T13:45:41 braun -> baget
Hey there, buddy!

2020-07-08T13:45:45 braun -> baget
How are you doing?

2020-07-08T13:46:37 baget -> braun


2020-07-08T13:46:49 baget -> braun
Unexpected, isn't it?

2020-07-08T13:47:00 baget -> braun
:-D

2020-07-08T13:47:46 baget -> braun
Yes, yes, I'm listening...

2020-07-08T13:47:55 baget -> braun
The mood is playful...

2020-07-08T13:48:16 braun -> baget
Very unexpected)

2020-07-08T13:48:32 braun -> baget
I see you're having a lot of fun)

2020-07-08-08T13:48:43 baget -> braun
Nah, that's hysterical.

2020-07-08T13:49:08 braun -> baget
That sounds about right.

2020-07-08T13:49:21 braun -> baget
What does it have to do with?

2020-07-08T13:49:38 baget -> braun
The events in Honduras have brought...

2020-07-08T13:49:54 baget -> braun
Buddy, ask the right questions.

2020-07-08T13:49:59 baget -> braun
Please.

2020-07-08T13:50:05 baget -> braun
I'm really busy.

2020-07-08T13:50:16 braun -> baget
Got it

2020-07-08T13:50:23 baget -> braun
Thank you.

2020-07-08T13:50:48 baget -> braun
Where the fuck is Kevin?

2020-07-08-08T13:51:11 braun -> baget
I'm afraid to ask, is the cryptolocker task progressing?

2020-07-08-08T13:51:28 baget -> braun
Yes, of course.

2020-07-08T13:51:40 baget -> braun
Everything is smooth here.

2020-07-08T13:51:43 baget -> braun
Working.

2020-07-08T13:52:03 braun -> baget
Great

2020-07-08T13:52:10 baget -> braun
For SMB and DAV I think 5...7 days is needed.

2020-07-08T13:52:28 baget -> braun
Worse with DFS, but they promised to help...

2020-07-08T13:52:33 baget -> braun
Why?

2020-07-08T13:53:15 baget -> braun
I really still don't understand how to put this shit into the overall locker canvas...

2020-07-08T13:53:24 baget -> braun
But we'll get it in somehow.

2020-07-08T13:53:31 baget -> braun
The unlucky thing.

2020-07-08T13:54:30 baget -> braun
Yes, yes, tell me.

2020-07-08T13:54:35 braun -> baget
Yes, to understand how we should be. We're already finishing with the admin.

2020-07-08-08T13:55:03 baget -> braun
And how did you unbundle the network balls in the admin?

2020-07-08T13:56:19 braun -> baget
No way, except that the statistics will need to be leaked and that's all.

2020-07-08T13:56:44 baget -> braun
Dude, watch carefully.

2020-07-08T13:56:47 braun -> baget
Or was it something Kevin suggested with the net balls?

2020-07-08T13:56:53 baget -> braun
carefully*

2020-07-08T13:57:12 braun -> baget
looking at

2020-07-08T13:57:13 baget -> braun
Okay, hold on.

2020-07-08T13:57:23 baget -> braun
What was your question?

2020-07-08T13:57:47 baget -> braun
I've been working since 7 a.m. this morning, and I'm a little fucked up...

2020-07-08T13:57:58 baget -> braun
Pardon my French.

2020-07-08T13:57:59 braun -> baget
I understand

2020-07-08T14:00:09 braun -> baget
We should be able to configure network encryption from the admin panel?
Or does it change the logic of communication between the locker and the admin panel?

2020-07-08T14:00:21 baget -> braun
А. Got it.

2020-07-08T14:00:29 baget -> braun
No. It won't.

2020-07-08T14:00:49 baget -> braun
Probably won't affect the admin area.

2020-07-08T14:03:47 braun -> baget
I think so, too, the only thing you need to throw the statue of the encrypted network balls if possible.

2020-07-08T14:12:49 baget -> braun
It's not a problem.

2020-07-08T14:13:20 baget -> braun
Distracted question.

2020-07-08-08T14:13:30 baget -> braun
Didn't you work with Chrome?

2020-07-08-08T14:13:54 baget -> braun
As a programmer, I mean.

2020-07-08-08T14:16:27 braun -> baget
No it didn't.

2020-07-08T14:16:37 baget -> braun
Pity. Question removed.

2020-07-08-08T14:16:55 braun -> baget
Uh-huh

2020-07-08T14:17:14 baget -> braun
Kevin promised a DAV server for testing...

2020-07-08T14:17:21 baget -> braun
I haven't given it away yet...

2020-07-08T14:17:51 baget -> braun
You don't have one, do you?

2020-07-08-08T14:19:17 braun -> baget
And I don't have a server.

2020-07-08T14:19:30 baget -> braun
Pity.

2020-07-08T14:19:39 braun -> baget
+

2020-07-08-08T14:19:53 baget -> braun
Def, the bastard, is silent.

2020-07-08T14:20:12 braun -> baget
It's hard to get through to them! (

2020-07-08T14:20:15 baget -> braun
Uh, on vacation...:-)

2020-07-08T14:20:51 braun -> baget
With a load like that, it's about time! =)

2020-07-08T14:22:00 baget -> braun
Ouch, that's not a load.

2020-07-08T14:22:09 baget -> braun
This is a mockery.

2020-07-08T14:22:40 baget -> braun
Wait. What was the question?

2020-07-08-08T14:22:51 baget -> braun
About admin?

2020-07-08T14:23:02 braun -> baget
It's all right now)

2020-07-08T14:23:06 braun -> baget
I think we got it all figured out)

2020-07-08T14:23:16 braun -> baget
thanks for the info

2020-07-08T14:24:06 baget -> braun
Which one?

2020-07-08T14:24:06 baget -> braun
Which one?

2020-07-08T14:24:17 baget -> braun
I didn't leak anything.

2020-07-08T14:24:30 braun -> baget
You blew it all :D

2020-07-08T14:24:45 baget -> braun
Well, as long as - not all of them.

2020-07-08T14:25:00 braun -> baget
+

2020-07-08-08T14:25:21 baget -> braun
When will you finish with the admin panel?

2020-07-08T14:26:59 braun -> baget
The basic work is done, testing and want to give it to kevin for work.

2020-07-08T14:27:10 baget -> braun
Great.

2020-07-08T14:27:35 baget -> braun
The locker is fine.

2020-07-08-08T14:27:38 baget -> braun
?

2020-07-08T14:27:45 braun -> baget
That's very good.

2020-07-08T14:28:02 baget -> braun
Pleasure.

2020-07-08T14:28:36 braun -> baget
Everything that was planned in the locker before the new task, it all works!

2020-07-08T14:43:16 baget -> braun
Pleasure.

2020-07-08T14:43:21 baget -> braun
How's your weather?

2020-07-08T14:43:33 baget -> braun
It's spring again.

2020-07-08T14:44:20 baget -> braun
It was +40 this morning. Within an hour it was down to +16.

2020-07-08T14:44:40 baget -> braun
The wind is knocking you down...:-)

2020-07-08T14:44:55 baget -> braun
The head is really cracking.

2020-07-08T14:47:03 baget -> braun
And get through to Kevin. I'm not getting through. Thanks.

2020-07-08T14:47:21 baget -> braun
The server with the DAV, I remind you. He promised.

2020-07-08T14:53:57 braun -> baget
I'll knock on Kevin's door ))

2020-07-08T14:54:08 baget -> braun
Thank you.

2020-07-08T14:54:10 braun -> baget
The weather is very sweltering!

2020-07-08T14:54:21 baget -> braun
We have a cyclone.

2020-07-08T14:54:39 baget -> braun
It got as dark as 10 p.m.

2020-07-08T14:54:55 baget -> braun
Creepy black clouds:-)

2020-07-08T14:54:59 braun -> baget
We're scared of rain and there's nothing(

2020-07-08T14:55:39 baget -> braun
We have clouds going around, but not a drop has fallen yet.

2020-07-08T14:55:50 baget -> braun
But nearby, yes, it's already flooded.

2020-07-08T14:56:02 braun -> baget
They're gaining momentum)

2020-07-08T14:56:31 baget -> braun
Heh:-) They're gaining momentum, but they're not much use...

2020-07-08T14:58:31 braun -> baget
For now, let's see what happens.

2020-07-08T14:59:42 baget -> braun
We won't have it any other way, as the rock massifs cleverly cut the streams here.

2020-07-08T15:00:06 baget -> braun
The result is a centrifuge effect.

2020-07-08T15:01:48 braun -> baget
Wow, are the winds powerful?

2020-07-08T15:02:01 baget -> braun
It's a real pain in the ass.

2020-07-08T15:02:35 baget -> braun
The wind blow overturns:-)

2020-07-08T15:03:23 baget -> braun
Let's just say going against the wind doesn't work.

2020-07-08T15:08:50 braun -> baget
With the sail especially :D

2020-07-08T15:09:28 braun -> baget
It's probably possible to fly a couple of meters)

2020-07-08T15:22:16 baget -> braun
You can do a couple of meters without a sail.

2020-07-08T15:23:05 braun -> baget
=)

2020-07-08-08T15:23:19 baget -> braun
Walked around, shutting everything down.

2020-07-08T15:23:44 baget -> braun
By the way, the roof ridge flew off the roof at 500 meters.

2020-07-08T15:23:53 baget -> braun
I'll pick it up tomorrow.

2020-07-08T15:24:43 baget -> braun
Or a new one.

2020-07-08T15:25:05 braun -> baget
Is this apparently one of the depressing problems of life in the Crimea?

2020-07-08-08T15:25:17 baget -> braun
This?

2020-07-08-08T15:25:21 baget -> braun
Problem?

2020-07-08T15:25:25 braun -> baget
strong winds

2020-07-08T15:25:26 baget -> braun
What's up...

2020-07-08T15:25:38 baget -> braun
At least that's some entertainment.

2020-07-08-08T15:25:55 braun -> baget
fine then

2020-07-08T15:26:04 baget -> braun
The problem is the prices.

2020-07-08T15:26:20 braun -> baget
expensive?

2020-07-08T15:26:32 baget -> braun
Alas, yes.

2020-07-08T15:26:52 baget -> braun
As the season comes, hide.

2020-07-08T15:27:23 baget -> braun
But, objectively, it is not in all of Crimea, but only here - in Sevastopol.

2020-07-08T15:27:39 baget -> braun
Prices are actually higher than in Moscow.

2020-07-08T15:27:48 braun -> baget
wow

2020-07-08T15:27:53 baget -> braun
Yep.

2020-07-08T15:28:30 baget -> braun
In Moscow, they don't pay 100 rubles per kilometer for a cab:-)

2020-07-08T15:28:56 braun -> baget
bold

2020-07-08T15:29:15 baget -> braun
From Sevastopol to Simferopol 4500 thousand to the airport.

2020-07-08T15:29:33 baget -> braun
4.5 thousand.

2020-07-08T15:29:38 baget -> braun
My bad.

2020-07-08T15:29:53 baget -> braun
80 kilometers. And around town it's a mess.

2020-07-08T15:30:01 baget -> braun
But, it is possible to order.

2020-07-08T15:30:13 baget -> braun
And the prices of munchies - don't come close.

2020-07-08T15:30:38 baget -> braun
Again, you have to know where to get it.

2020-07-08T15:31:10 baget -> braun
You can buy a beer for 140, and next door, around the corner, the exact same -55.

2020-07-08T15:31:27 baget -> braun
And so, in principle, with everything.

2020-07-08T15:32:43 braun -> baget
Simply put: you have to be a local to know that!

2020-07-08T15:32:55 baget -> braun
And not only that.

2020-07-08T15:33:18 baget -> braun
It is necessary to go to the wholesalers, know where and when.

2020-07-08T15:33:46 baget -> braun
And if you need some little thing, you know, you can't go through half the city.

2020-07-08T15:34:02 baget -> braun
And we have such traffic that it's faster to walk.

2020-07-08T15:34:10 baget -> braun
Or on a mountain transport.

2020-07-08T15:34:24 baget -> braun
Separate lanes for them.

2020-07-08T15:34:50 baget -> braun
Alas, we have neither subways nor streetcars...:-)

2020-07-08T15:35:17 baget -> braun
There was a streetcar, but it was abandoned.

2020-07-08T15:35:36 baget -> braun
A long time ago:-)

2020-07-08T15:36:07 baget -> braun
It worked until 1941.

2020-07-08T15:41:24 braun -> baget
Have the roads been made at your place?

2020-07-08T15:53:45 baget -> braun
Aki mirror.

2020-07-08T15:54:54 braun -> baget
I don't get it.

2020-07-08T15:55:33 braun -> baget
before this post, what were the posts?)

2020-07-08T15:55:43 braun -> baget
I got kicked out, maybe something didn't come

2020-07-08T16:03:32 baget -> braun
Hear, hear.

2020-07-08T16:03:47 baget -> braun
Can't you make one account?

2020-07-08T16:04:06 braun -> baget
So I have one.

2020-07-08T16:04:13 baget -> braun
Nope.

<braun@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion/DESKTOP-7M0L4FA>

2020-07-08T16:04:27 braun -> baget
Are the addresses different?

2020-07-08-08T16:04:38 baget -> braun
 <braun@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion/Psi+>

2020-07-08T16:05:02 braun -> baget
ok

2020-07-08T16:06:03 baget -> braun
Try it. It's very uncomfortable.

2020-07-08T16:18:00 braun -> baget
Done.

2020-07-08T16:18:16 braun -> baget
Now I will always write from this account

2020-07-08T16:18:28 baget -> braun
Great.

2020-07-08T16:18:44 baget -> braun
But, I'm not deleting the second one yet :-)

2020-07-08T16:18:59 baget -> braun
I texted Kevin.

2020-07-08T16:19:01 braun -> baget
Which one is shown now?

2020-07-08-08T16:19:10 baget -> braun
<braun@q3mcco35auwcstmt.onion/Psi+>

2020-07-08-08T16:19:22 braun -> baget
kevin give you what you need?

2020-07-08T16:19:36 baget -> braun
Promises only.

2020-07-08T16:20:00 braun -> baget
It all makes sense...

2020-07-08T16:20:18 baget -> braun
He has you as Miguel?

2020-07-08-08T16:21:08 baget -> braun
Who's that?

2020-07-08T16:21:12 braun -> baget
This is his assistant, I wrote to him.

2020-07-08-08T16:21:21 baget -> braun
Ah, then I see.

2020-07-08T16:21:40 baget -> braun
Then it's not interesting:-)

2020-07-08T16:22:23 baget -> braun
I keep trying to get in touch with Def.

2020-07-08T16:22:36 baget -> braun
This one will solve everything in a jiffy.

2020-07-08T16:22:50 baget -> braun
It's hard without a test platform.

2020-07-08T16:23:54 braun -> baget
Miguel was a user of the admin system and cryptolocker from another company.
We do the interface and logic from his words. Only he's not a proger, just a user!

2020-07-08T16:24:30 braun -> baget
Def is also hard to reach!

2020-07-08T16:24:43 baget -> braun
Trying...

2020-07-08T16:24:55 baget -> braun
Busy, apparently.

2020-07-08T16:25:19 baget -> braun
Yeah, and we're just picking pears here...:-)

2020-07-08T16:25:37 braun -> baget
woah)

2020-07-08T16:26:20 braun -> baget
I'm going to reload on linux now...

2020-07-08T16:26:35 baget -> braun
Yeah, let's give it a try.

2020-07-08T16:29:22 braun -> baget
Is everything okay?

2020-07-08T16:29:38 baget -> braun
On linux?

2020-07-08T16:29:43 braun -> baget
+

2020-07-08T16:30:02 baget -> braun
Yeah, now it hasn't switched.

2020-07-08T16:30:06 baget -> braun
Works.

2020-07-08T16:30:09 baget -> braun
Well done!

2020-07-08T16:30:13 braun -> baget
Yay...

2020-07-08T16:30:51 baget -> braun
I'm going to wing it, my friend.

2020-07-08T16:31:10 braun -> baget
?

Progress with the locker*

2020-07-14T14:12:15 baget -> braun
I can tell you for sure that I still haven't got the test server.

2020-07-14T14:12:34 baget -> braun
I've already emailed Kevin - so far no word.

2020-07-14T14:12:48 baget -> braun
Honestly, I don't know.

2020-07-14T14:12:58 baget -> braun
I can't test it. I have nothing to test on.

2020-07-14T14:13:27 braun -> baget
Yeah...

2020-07-14T14:13:39 baget -> braun
You can get busy.

2020-07-14T14:13:50 baget -> braun
Make a server for the test.

2020-07-14T14:13:55 baget -> braun
I'll say thank you.

2020-07-14T14:14:01 braun -> baget
Ok)

2020-07-14T14:14:07 braun -> baget
Which one do you want?

2020-07-14T14:14:17 baget -> braun
It's still the same.

2020-07-14T14:14:20 baget -> braun
WinDAV

2020-07-14T14:14:44 braun -> baget
Does it block open balls?

2020-07-14T14:15:44 baget -> braun
This is what it is - a balloon.

2020-07-14T14:16:10 baget -> braun
One of.

2020-07-14T14:16:18 baget -> braun
Or are you talking about SMB?

2020-07-14T14:16:22 braun -> baget
+

2020-07-14T14:16:27 baget -> braun
So there's no problem there.

2020-07-14T14:16:56 baget -> braun
But, I'm telling you exactly. It's not about SMB.

2020-07-14T14:17:20 braun -> baget
Yeah, I get it.

2020-07-14T14:17:23 baget -> braun
Just as long as it's not DFS.

2020-07-14T14:18:04 baget -> braun

mda.... fast guys.

2020-07-14T14:19:41 baget -> braun
I've already been to the torrent today. Silence.

2020-07-14T14:20:27 baget -> braun
Why don't you really go ahead and deploy the DAV server, huh?

2020-07-14T14:20:37 baget -> braun
If there's nothing else to do.

2020-07-14T14:21:57 braun -> baget
Yes, there are cases. But now I'll give the admins the task.

2020-07-15T13:56:52 baget -> braun
Hi!

2020-07-15T13:57:06 braun -> baget
Hi

2020-07-15T13:57:19 baget -> braun
Anything cleared up with the server? Didn't you find out?

2020-07-15T13:57:46 braun -> baget
Kevin promised to give the server by tonight

2020-07-15T13:58:00 baget -> braun
Oh, it would be good...

How are you doing?

2020-07-16T09:10:48 braun -> baget

Hi, bro)

2020-07-17T16:46:41 braun -> baget
Did they give you a server?

2020-07-17T16:46:51 baget -> braun
Hi.

2020-07-17T16:47:01 baget -> braun
Yes, thank you.

wow

2020-07-17T16:48:10 braun -> baget
Something serious?

2020-07-17T16:48:29 baget -> braun
Flu or something close to it.

2020-07-17T16:48:39 braun -> baget
Did Kevin give you a server or green?

2020-07-17T16:48:47 baget -> braun
Grynia.

2020-07-17T16:49:17 braun -> baget
Buddy be well....

2020-07-17T16:49:28 braun -> baget
Where did you pick this up?

2020-07-17T16:49:38 baget -> braun
Picked up...

2020-07-17T16:49:45 baget -> braun
Presented:-)

2020-07-17T16:50:03 baget -> braun
I already have all my family members over the disease.

2020-07-17T16:50:19 baget -> braun
I was hoping it would blow over. Alas...

2020-07-17T16:50:52 baget -> braun
They go sailing on the seas, you know, bringing all sorts of disease into the house.

2020-07-17T16:51:12 braun -> baget
Apparently so....

2020-07-17T16:54:29 braun -> baget
You then rest today and the weekend and heal,

2020-07-17T16:54:53 braun -> baget
And from the week you'll start working, as the strength will appear...

2020-07-17T16:54:56 baget -> braun
I'm on the mend, buddy.

2020-07-17T16:55:12 baget -> braun
Yes, I was working today as well.

2020-07-17T16:55:18 braun -> baget
drink more tea, it's good for kicking out)

2020-07-17T16:55:26 baget -> braun
It's not that bad...

2020-07-17T16:55:52 baget -> braun
Yes, that's what I'm doing. Thanks.

2020-07-17T16:55:58 braun -> baget
Well, you still need to take care of yourself)

2020-07-17T16:56:03 braun -> baget
alright)

2020-07-17T16:56:18 braun -> baget
When you've done the task, write and we'll test it))

2020-07-17T16:56:39 baget -> braun
Absolutely.

2020-07-17T16:57:01 braun -> baget
By the way, what's the weather like over there right now?

2020-07-17T16:57:17 baget -> braun
Okay.

2020-07-17T16:57:30 baget -> braun
It's relatively not hot.

2020-07-17T16:57:55 baget -> braun
The water, in turn, has warmed up enough.

2020-07-17T16:58:18 baget -> braun
In summary: quite comfortable.

2020-07-17T17:00:48 braun -> baget
(It's awesome, it makes me want to go to the sea))

2020-07-20T10:52:48 braun -> baget

2020-07-20T10:55:31 baget -> braun
Working.

2020-07-20T10:59:12 braun -> baget
Great.

2020-07-20T10:59:30 braun -> baget

2020-07-20T10:59:41 baget -> braun
No.

2020-07-20T10:59:52 baget -> braun
I'll start today.

2020-07-20T11:00:16 baget -> braun
I could barely breathe on Friday. :-)

2020-07-20T11:00:29 braun -> baget
Yes, that's right_)

2020-07-20T11:00:32 baget -> braun
I spent the whole weekend in a state of limbo.

2020-07-20T11:14:52 braun -> baget
Fever or just weakness?

2020-07-20T11:16:24 baget -> braun
And fever and nasopharyngitis, in short - the typical flu.

2020-07-20T11:17:10 braun -> baget
The main thing is that it gets easier...

2020-07-24T12:29:56 braun -> baget
Greetings, buddy!

2020-07-24T12:30:05 braun -> baget

2020-07-24T12:31:15 baget -> braun
Yes, of course.

2020-07-24T12:31:25 braun -> baget
Great

2020-07-24T12:32:24 braun -> baget
For the record, when do you think to show the result?

2020-07-24T12:32:42 baget -> braun
I won't say.

2020-07-24T12:32:56 baget -> braun
I have two more projects in parallel.

2020-07-24T12:33:01 baget -> braun
But, soon.

2020-07-24T12:38:42 baget -> braun
Actually, I only have DAV left.

2020-07-24T12:39:07 baget -> braun

What - "got it"?

2020-07-27T15:10:25 baget -> braun
I ask what they say.

2020-07-27T15:10:26 braun -> baget
What a mess you're in.

2020-07-27T15:10:34 baget -> braun
Answer according to the form.

2020-07-27T15:10:43 baget -> braun
My blockage doesn't fuck with you.

2020-07-27T15:10:55 baget -> braun
Well, you got it....

2020-07-27T15:10:56 braun -> baget
They want to know when the locker will be ready.

2020-07-27T15:11:15 baget -> braun
Yup, so give that one to them.

2020-07-27T15:11:23 baget -> braun
Let them play.

2020-07-27T15:11:38 baget -> braun
Shit, I'm going to upload it from SMB

2020-07-27T15:12:21 braun -> baget
I thought you didn't do c SMB...

2020-07-27T15:12:57 baget -> braun

Between the third and fourth bottle of beer.

2020-07-27T15:13:37 braun -> baget

2020-07-28T19:56:33 baget -> braun
Tomorrow.

2020-07-28T19:56:52 baget -> braun
I have to admit, I'm already falling asleep.

2020-07-28T19:57:18 baget -> braun
It's been a really stupid day.

2020-07-28T19:57:31 baget -> braun
Plus, the weather's gone bad.

2020-07-28T19:57:38 braun -> baget
Lots to do?

2020-07-28T19:57:43 baget -> braun
Enough.

2020-07-28T19:57:44 braun -> baget
What's up with the weather?

2020-07-28T19:57:59 baget -> braun
It's cloudy, wet, and doldrums.

2020-07-28T19:58:03 baget -> braun
raining

2020-07-28T19:58:18 baget -> braun
Consequence - all day long you feel sleepy :-)

2020-07-29T14:59:07 braun -> baget
Hi, bro)

2020-07-29T14:59:19 baget -> braun
Hi!!!

2020-07-29T14:59:33 braun -> baget
How have you been celebrating? Or are you still at work?

2020-07-29T14:59:43 baget -> braun
You won't believe this.

2020-07-29T14:59:56 baget -> braun
I went to my place for bandages.

2020-07-29T15:00:04 baget -> braun
Drunk!!!:-)

2020-07-29T15:00:27 baget -> braun
Implemented the idea of a simulator.

2020-07-29T15:00:56 baget -> braun
With our labor policy, soon all the muscles will be deflated...:-)

2020-07-29T15:01:24 braun -> baget
Ohhhh...you have to work on your muscles! I'm like that myself)

2020-07-29T15:01:32 baget -> braun
That's right.

2020-07-29T15:01:48 baget -> braun
And, that's why they gave me a trainer.

2020-07-29T15:01:56 baget -> braun
Now we need bandages!

2020-07-29T15:02:00 braun -> baget
Awesome

2020-07-29T15:02:10 braun -> baget
Which one?

2020-07-29T15:02:26 baget -> braun
27 Kilogram Onion.

2020-07-29T15:02:40 baget -> braun
27 is the tension of the bowstring.

2020-07-29T15:03:05 baget -> braun
Limit.

2020-07-29T15:03:05 braun -> baget
It must be powerful, I'm not good at it.

2020-07-29T15:03:14 baget -> braun
Well, let me put it this way.

2020-07-29T15:03:31 baget -> braun
Thank God I'm only halfway there.

2020-07-29T15:03:53 baget -> braun
Otherwise the bowstring would have cut the arm off on the return stroke.

2020-07-29T15:04:15 baget -> braun
See, I told you, you can't shoot a bow without a handcuff!

2020-07-29T15:04:23 braun -> baget
Wow

2020-07-29T15:04:27 baget -> braun
Yes!

2020-07-29T15:04:35 baget -> braun
My whole hand is swollen.

2020-07-29T15:04:39 braun -> baget
be careful with that!

2020-07-29T15:04:44 baget -> braun

Take care of your hands, head and eyes.... And in general, you should take care of yourself!

2020-07-29T15:05:07 baget -> braun
Thank God for the Mongolian grip shot.

2020-07-29T15:05:24 braun -> baget
I didn't think it was that serious!

2020-07-29T15:05:32 baget -> braun
If he had fired a British one, some of the meat would have been cut off.

2020-07-29T15:05:53 baget -> braun
Yes!

2020-07-29T15:05:58 baget -> braun
What did you think?

2020-07-29T15:06:41 baget -> braun
Yeah come to think of it, the tension on the bowstring is blade -15...17 kilograms.

2020-07-29T15:07:00 baget -> braun
Can you imagine a blade under the weight of 15 kilograms?

2020-07-29T15:07:17 braun -> baget
Yes, I imagined the picture, it made me sick!)

2020-07-29T15:07:23 baget -> braun
There!

2020-07-29T15:07:32 baget -> braun
That's what I'm talking about.

2020-07-29T15:07:55 baget -> braun
Okay, I have experience, so I wrapped my left hand with a towel.

2020-07-29T15:08:21 baget -> braun
And it fucked up so badly that it went black in my eyes.

2020-07-29T15:08:29 baget -> braun
eyes

2020-07-29T15:08:33 braun -> baget
So you're some kind of extreme guy, huh?

2020-07-29T15:08:43 baget -> braun
No.

2020-07-29T15:08:46 braun -> baget
Have you ever jumped from a hang-glider?

2020-07-29T15:08:52 baget -> braun
No.

2020-07-29T15:09:04 braun -> baget

2020-07-29T15:09:11 baget -> braun
Wanted.

2020-07-29T15:09:22 braun -> baget
What's the matter with you, it's so little Oo

2020-07-29T15:09:32 baget -> braun
But, they wouldn't even let me jump with a parachute.

2020-07-29T15:10:14 baget -> braun
I am one-quarter Chukcha, one-quarter Greek, one-quarter Khokhol, one-quarter Russian.

2020-07-29T15:10:23 baget -> braun
They all don't bother...:-)

2020-07-29T15:10:47 baget -> braun

2020-07-29T15:12:01 braun -> baget
Good for you!

2020-07-29T15:12:14 baget -> braun
God willing.

2020-07-29T15:12:34 baget -> braun
You won't believe this...

2020-07-29T15:12:48 baget -> braun
I didn't have any money - I bought a lottery ticket.

2020-07-29T15:13:30 baget -> braun
What do you think?

2020-07-29T15:14:06 braun -> baget
Did you win?

2020-07-29T15:14:11 baget -> braun
No!

2020-07-29T15:14:18 baget -> braun
Lost!

2020-07-29T15:14:19 braun -> baget
No wonder)

2020-07-29T15:14:36 baget -> braun
But, the nerves gave up and took the dough off the management!

2020-07-29T15:14:43 baget -> braun
And they didn't turn me down...

2020-07-29T15:15:00 baget -> braun
Really, that was two years ago.

2020-07-29T15:15:36 baget -> braun
What's up with you.

2020-07-29T15:15:52 braun -> baget
Is that an expensive lottery ticket?

2020-07-29T15:15:58 baget -> braun
Give me the bill, I'll put some money in it for you - go have a drink for me.

2020-07-29T15:16:04 baget -> braun
No.

2020-07-29T15:16:08 baget -> braun
Useless.

2020-07-29T15:16:24 baget -> braun
I want to give you a gift.

2020-07-29T15:17:34 baget -> braun
I was convinced that the birthday boy should give his birthday present, not the other way around.

2020-07-29T15:17:53 baget -> braun
Well, that's our way of saying thank you.

2020-07-29T15:18:06 baget -> braun
So, come on!

2020-07-29T15:18:16 braun -> baget

2020-07-29T15:19:06 baget -> braun
I don't want to drink for you.

2020-07-29T15:19:16 baget -> braun
And that's the end of it.

2020-07-29T15:19:41 baget -> braun
I wanted to make you feel good.

2020-07-29T15:19:52 baget -> braun

Ahhhh...

2020-08-04T20:35:12 baget -> braun
Well, you can do it that way.

2020-08-04T20:35:14 baget -> braun
:-)

2020-08-04T20:35:40 braun -> baget
Uh-huh

2020-08-04T20:36:24 braun -> baget
We'll see what's there and how it is. Then we want to go to Cape Fiolent, if everything is okay.

2020-08-04T20:37:43 baget -> braun
Well, you tell me right away that you're a rich man.

2020-08-04T20:38:14 baget -> braun
I can fly to Japan, but I can't stay in Koktebeyl.

2020-08-04T20:41:15 baget -> braun
Come on over - we'll figure it out!

2020-08-04T20:46:16 braun -> baget

2020-08-04T20:57:36 baget -> braun
You're a bastard.

2020-08-04T20:58:09 baget -> braun
You won't believe this, but even I need to sleep sometimes (rarely).

2020-08-04T20:58:19 baget -> braun
I'm coming to visit.

2020-08-04T20:58:42 baget -> braun
And we've got a shitload of precios! :-D

2020-08-04T20:58:49 braun -> baget

2020-08-04T20:59:41 braun -> baget
Ok

2020-08-04T20:59:46 braun -> baget
I'll order a KAMAZ

2020-08-04T21:00:01 baget -> braun
Took it off the tree - 12...20 hours.

2020-08-04T21:00:16 baget -> braun
Then - only in the trash.

2020-08-04T21:00:32 baget -> braun
They don't.

2020-08-04T21:00:37 braun -> baget
Any more left on the tree?

2020-08-04T21:00:37 baget -> braun
Even the green ones.

2020-08-04T21:00:57 baget -> braun
Well, there's still 150...200 kilos.

2020-08-04T21:01:01 braun -> baget
Ours froze in this year( And that year we only lived on them that summer!

2020-08-04T21:01:14 braun -> baget
Great, we're on our way to you.

2020-08-04T21:01:24 braun -> baget
You are now a priority.

2020-08-04T21:01:32 baget -> braun
Great.

2020-08-04T21:01:48 baget -> braun

No charge.

2020-08-04T21:05:48 baget -> braun

:-)

2020-08-04T21:17:45 braun -> baget
Don't think so...

2020-08-17T09:06:03 braun -> baget
What is the locator for?

2020-08-17T09:06:17 braun -> baget
Let's test

2020-08-17T09:06:18 baget -> braun
Determine addresses of machines on the network.

2020-08-17T09:06:32 braun -> baget
got it

2020-08-17T09:06:53 baget -> braun
Yes, vinda 10 may not be visible on the network via the API

2020-08-17T09:07:29 baget -> braun
Did you get the advance?

2020-08-17T09:07:36 braun -> baget
no

2020-08-17T09:08:04 baget -> braun
I knocked on Stern's door - so far he's not saying anything.

2020-08-17T09:14:12 braun -> baget
same situation.

2020-08-17T09:14:26 braun -> baget
How are things at home?)

2020-08-17T09:14:52 braun -> baget
Are the peaches ripe?)

2020-08-17T09:15:43 baget -> braun
No.

2020-08-17T09:15:57 baget -> braun
I think by the end of the week they'll be here.

2020-08-17T09:16:25 baget -> braun
And you can't eat them that way - inedible:-)

2020-08-17T09:16:42 braun -> baget
that's right.

2020-08-17T09:16:58 baget -> braun
Did you like the apples?

2020-08-17T09:17:12 braun -> baget
Very)

2020-08-17T09:17:15 braun -> baget
But we already went home for the weekend!

What do you mean?

2020-08-17T09:17:52 braun -> baget
I'm home already.

2020-08-17T09:17:52 baget -> braun
You were going to sit here for another week, weren't you?

2020-08-17T09:18:20 baget -> braun
Tyu, I thought I was going to throw you up before I left!

2020-08-17T09:18:30 baget -> braun
What the hell are you doing!!!

2020-08-17T09:18:47 braun -> baget
That's enough for now, the little ones are sick. I haven't been able to work in peace).

2020-08-17T09:19:03 baget -> braun
Uh-oh, that's how...

2020-08-17T09:19:09 baget -> braun
Bad.

2020-08-17T09:19:16 braun -> baget
It's better to go out in the fall, I'll take a normal vacation and come if everything will be okay.

2020-08-17T09:19:38 baget -> braun
Great idea!

2020-08-17T09:19:52 baget -> braun
That's good in the fall.

2020-08-17T09:20:06 baget -> braun
There are almost no people, no insane heat.

2020-08-17T09:20:19 baget -> braun
Let's go to a submarine factory...

2020-08-17T09:20:42 baget -> braun
There's a new exhibit set up.

2020-08-17T09:20:54 braun -> baget
Cool, wanted to go. And also to the gallery in Feodosia.

2020-08-17T09:21:20 baget -> braun

2020-08-17T09:21:26 braun -> baget
+

2020-08-17T09:21:31 braun -> baget
The main thing is to close the projects, so that my conscience does not torment me)

2020-08-17T09:21:43 baget -> braun
We'll close this week.

2020-08-17T09:21:51 baget -> braun

I'll have to throw you a locker.

2020-08-25T14:34:05 braun -> baget
have you done it yet?

2020-08-25T14:34:09 baget -> braun
Yes.

2020-08-25T14:34:35 baget -> braun
Asked Padawan to finish the piece, I'll give it to you today and drop it off.

2020-08-25T14:34:39 braun -> baget
Why wasn't there any light? Did you break into the station?

2020-08-25T14:34:45 baget -> braun
No.

2020-08-25T14:34:55 baget -> braun
There's nothing to hack...

2020-08-25T14:35:12 baget -> braun
It's breaking in on its own, over the years...

2020-08-25T14:36:37 braun -> baget
Okay, so smb and webdav have been defeated?

2020-08-25T14:36:53 baget -> braun
Right.

2020-08-25T14:37:34 braun -> baget
You have to install your own wind solar generator

2020-08-25T14:37:55 baget -> braun
I agree.

2020-08-25T14:38:07 braun -> baget
Great, I'm ready to test it;)

2020-08-25T14:38:21 baget -> braun

2020-08-25T14:40:15 braun -> baget
mine is asking to go in the fall, and my mother-in-law is asking to go)))

2020-08-25T14:40:29 baget -> braun
That's a great idea.

2020-08-25T14:40:51 baget -> braun
Believe me, it's a lot more comfortable in the fall.

2020-08-25T14:41:05 baget -> braun
Yeah, and variety doesn't hurt.

2020-08-25T14:42:46 braun -> baget

2020-08-31T06:55:11 braun -> baget
Did a good turkey visit you?

2020-08-31T06:55:27 baget -> braun
I'll tell you in an hour and a half.

2020-08-31T06:56:06 braun -> baget

2020-08-31T06:56:40 braun -> baget
Tell me about the project, are you combining modules now?

2020-08-31T06:56:53 baget -> braun
I don't get it...

2020-08-31T06:57:32 braun -> baget
Well what you have the network is scanned, but the files are not encrypted. Now you need to merge with encryption?

2020-08-31T06:57:44 baget -> braun
А! This.

2020-08-31T06:57:52 baget -> braun
Yes!

2020-08-31T06:57:59 baget -> braun

Or is it all the same?

2020-08-31T16:12:23 braun -> baget
Yeah ok.

2020-09-18T14:08:29 baget -> braun
There are, but there are tasks that can't be reassigned.

2020-09-18T14:09:03 braun -> baget

Yes, it's a challenge.

2020-09-18T14:19:37 baget -> braun

Can you fix these points::
- does not delete README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt file in all encrypted folders; (important)
- does not return the desktop splash screen to its final appearance;
- does not send the file with the file lending(README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt) to the desktop;

2020-10-06T05:05:37 braun -> baget
- does not send the file with the file lending (README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt) to the desktop; (This happens if I choose to encrypt certain folders. By convention, the file should always appear on the desktop).

2020-10-16T08:27:32 baget -> braun
I wanted to make a special trip today, at least to buy you a box and send it.

2020-10-16T08:27:52 baget -> braun
And now I've looked at it - it's already starting to deteriorate...

2020-10-16T08:28:10 baget -> braun
They won't make it...

2020-10-22T13:58:52 braun -> baget
Afternoon.

2020-10-22T13:59:06 braun -> baget
How's it going buddy?

2020-10-22T13:59:30 baget -> braun
Hi.

2020-10-22T13:59:37 baget -> braun
Bad.

2020-10-22T13:59:51 baget -> braun
The pressure spiked.

2020-10-22T14:00:00 baget -> braun
The second day of torture.

2020-10-22T14:00:23 baget -> braun
Asked Globus to finish the locker.

2020-10-22T14:00:36 braun -> baget
wow

2020-10-22T14:00:46 baget -> braun
You need to remove the error in the chedouler and that's it.

2020-10-22T14:00:54 baget -> braun
The rest is done.

2020-10-22T14:01:04 baget -> braun
Yep.

2020-10-22T14:01:06 braun -> baget
What's the matter with you, is your heart racing?

2020-10-22T14:01:23 baget -> braun
I have no idea.

2020-10-22T14:02:04 braun -> baget
Why are you scaring me! You need to take care of your health.

2020-10-22T14:02:25 baget -> braun
I need to rest...

2020-10-22T14:03:44 braun -> baget
That's the most important thing, so take a vacation buddy. No one will restore your health and no one will take care of you but yourself)

2020-10-22T14:04:32 baget -> braun
I'll close the projects by the end of the month and maybe I will.

2020-10-22T14:05:50 braun -> baget
Yes on the project, I see that globus is pouring into git. Now there will be a locker in exe and dll? And how to run the dll? Because I haven't worked with dll projects yet.

2020-10-22T14:06:14 braun -> baget
If it were up to me, I'd give you a magic kick)

2020-10-22T14:06:21 braun -> baget

As you wish!

2020-10-22T14:07:27 braun -> baget
Okay, I'll figure it out.)

2020-10-22T14:38:00 braun -> baget
Is it still warm at your place?

2020-10-26T09:30:12 braun -> baget
Hey there, buddy.

2020-10-26T09:31:59 baget -> braun
Oh, I'll ask.

2020-10-26T09:33:17 braun -> baget
ok

2020-10-26T10:35:27 baget -> braun

Didn't find out about the locker?

2020-10-26T18:22:38 baget -> braun
Learned.

2020-10-26T18:22:42 baget -> braun

Hi.

2020-11-02T16:32:45 braun -> baget
What exactly are you interested in?

2020-11-02T16:33:10 braun -> baget
A little understanding.

2020-11-02T16:34:18 baget -> braun
Will bitcoins grow or convert to cash now?

2020-11-02T16:34:51 braun -> baget
Wow...that's an interesting question)

2020-11-02T16:35:11 baget -> braun
It's not a question, it's fucked up!

2020-11-02T16:35:44 baget -> braun

I am dumb NOT FUCKING AWAY at this!!!

2020-11-02T16:37:13 braun -> baget
I can't tell, but one guy told me if bitcoin breaks through a bit more, it will grow further.
When it was 12k per bit he said it would go up 90%. He was right.

2020-11-02T16:37:34 baget -> braun
Don't get smart!

2020-11-02T16:37:39 baget -> braun
Sell or not?

And that's just in one week.

2020-11-02T16:39:54 baget -> braun

2020-11-02T16:41:42 baget -> braun
One day their car broke down, the next day their jaw broke down, the next day their chainsaw broke down, the next day they had a power saw, the next fucking thing...

2020-11-02T16:41:50 baget -> braun
No.

2020-11-02T16:41:54 baget -> braun
Thank God.

2020-11-02T16:42:14 baget -> braun
There's a 30-pound bow.

2020-11-02T16:43:01 baget -> braun
This is the tension on the bowstring

2020-11-02T16:43:07 baget -> braun

2020-11-02T16:43:26 braun -> baget
Yes, you said that you hurt your arm...

2020-11-02T16:43:36 baget -> braun
Already stuffed.

Already learned.

2020-11-02T16:44:02 braun -> baget
that's good.

2020-11-02T16:44:32 baget -> braun
Brother, you ask about the beats.

2020-11-02T16:44:40 baget -> braun
I'm totally dumb on this one.

2020-11-02T16:45:10 baget -> braun
I've only got 120,000...130,000 left on the old one.

2020-11-02T16:45:26 baget -> braun
And in a new way, read all 200...

2020-11-02T16:45:37 baget -> braun
Help me out here, huh?

2020-11-02T16:46:22 baget -> braun
Junior got sick - spent from reserve.

2020-11-02T16:46:37 baget -> braun
Mom's jaw broke - spent out of reserve.

2020-11-02T16:46:54 baget -> braun
Daddy's car has wheels - spent from the reserve...

2020-11-02T16:47:00 baget -> braun
And that's it!

2020-11-02T16:47:14 baget -> braun
If I had known, I would have told everyone to go fuck themselves.

2020-11-02T16:47:32 baget -> braun
Out of reserve is out of bits.

2020-11-02T16:48:29 baget -> braun
And now Stern is laughing at me too! He says - I told you to watch out for the bits! Really - I did. Five times...

2020-11-02T17:11:54 braun -> baget
If Stern talks, he won't advise bad things.

2020-11-02T17:12:09 braun -> baget
I asked the man, but he's not answering yet.

2020-11-02T17:12:26 baget -> braun
Thank you very much!

2020-11-02T17:12:41 baget -> braun

Uh-huh

But, if anything becomes known, please share.

2020-11-02T17:13:25 baget -> braun
Thank you.

2020-11-02T17:13:42 baget -> braun
I'm completely clueless on this subject.

2020-11-02T17:13:48 braun -> baget
for sure

2020-11-02T17:14:18 baget -> braun
This is not quantum physics. It's more complicated than that:-)

2020-11-02T17:16:59 braun -> baget
Very much so... although it's also an interesting topic to explore.

2020-11-02T17:19:47 braun -> baget
Andy, [02.11.20 20:18].
If it comes down to 12300-12400 and does not go further it may go up again, and 13300 is the nearest level) may come up and push up

Andy, [02.11.20 20:18]
but also can go down here the nearest big level such current at 12300-12400 before that can walk))))

Andy, [02.11.20 20:19]
100% there is no way anyone can tell

2020-11-02T18:04:11 baget -> braun
Yeah, either yes or no, or maybe:-)

2020-11-02T18:04:35 baget -> braun
Ah, screw it.

2020-11-02T18:05:04 baget -> braun
The nervous system is more expensive.

2020-11-02T18:48:48 braun -> baget
Nervous system is more expensive, that's for sure)

2020-11-03T07:43:17 braun -> baget
The nervous system is more expensive, that's for sure)
