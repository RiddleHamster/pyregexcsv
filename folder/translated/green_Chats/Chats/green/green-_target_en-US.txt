Hi, I don't know exactly, but it's a backdoor that makes a dns session

2020-06-25T07:23:52 target -> green
Yeah, so I got it right.

My goal is not to conduct attacks, but to understand how it works for self-development

2020-06-25T13:21:56 target -> green
is it true that by sut.

essentially

bacon listener

2020-06-25T13:22:02 target -> green
it's like a paiload

2020-06-25T13:22:08 target -> green
which is placed on the bot

2020-06-25T13:22:15 target -> green
and how does uk communicate with the coba server

2020-06-25T13:22:23 target -> green
and that there is a module of some kind

2020-06-25T13:22:26 target -> green
which works internally

2020-06-25T13:22:33 target -> green
linking one bacon to another

2020-06-25T13:22:45 target -> green
without external bounce from the network

2020-06-25T13:23:18 target -> green
And why is there an injection function in browsers with exploits
Is it to spread internally through the locale?

I will not be useful and I have no time, but I want to understand the general principle in so much time

2020-07-09T11:14:31 target -> green
Then let's hug it out.

2020-07-09T11:14:43 target -> green

2020-07-09T11:41:44 target -> green
A Bentley will come knocking on your door.

2020-07-09T11:41:46 target -> green

2020-07-09T11:41:49 target -> green

2020-07-09T11:41:51 target -> green
and deploys there

2020-07-09T11:41:53 target -> green
while there is time

2020-07-09T11:41:55 target -> green
ok?

2020-07-09T11:42:05 green -> target

2020-07-09T11:43:31 target -> green
I will upload 1 grid there later and just poke it in the menu until I do not touch yours.

2020-07-09T12:08:18 target -> green

2020-07-09T12:08:24 target -> green
on winds

2020-07-09T12:08:25 target -> green
no?

2020-07-09T12:09:10 green -> target

2020-07-09T12:10:01 target -> green
so

2020-07-09T12:10:03 target -> green

2020-07-09T12:10:15 target -> green

2020-07-09T12:10:33 target -> green
I'll upload a couple more to it and watch them there.

2020-07-09T12:10:41 green -> target
Yeah, then you don't need a server.

2020-07-31T13:56:27 target -> green
How to remove it

2020-07-31T13:59:21 green -> target
hi

2020-07-31T13:59:39 green -> target
And the file explorer doesn't remove it either?

I had this, it didn't delete from the orb

2020-07-31T14:00:40 target -> green

2020-07-31T14:01:54 target -> green
got it thanks

2020-07-31T14:01:57 green -> target

2020-07-31T14:02:00 green -> target
location

2020-07-31T14:02:06 green -> target
and delete from there

2020-07-31T14:02:18 green -> target
mv command

2020-07-31T15:48:41 target -> green
green

2020-07-31T15:48:42 target -> green
and a question also

2020-07-31T15:48:45 target -> green
how to run the file

2020-07-31T15:48:50 target -> green
if execute

2020-07-31T15:48:55 target -> green
via clicks

2020-07-31T15:48:58 target -> green
which argument to write

2020-07-31T15:49:29 green -> target
yes no just run if there are no arguments

2020-07-31T15:49:50 green -> target
normal exe pcs without arguments

2020-07-31T15:50:20 green -> target
these are like files where you have to write the options on startup

2020-07-31T15:50:35 target -> green
Got it thanks

2020-09-30T11:10:21 target -> green

2020-09-30T11:10:25 target -> green
domains

2020-09-30T11:10:29 target -> green
working

2020-09-30T11:10:31 target -> green
in 1-2 hours

2020-09-30T11:10:34 target -> green
then we don't work

2020-09-30T11:10:36 target -> green
There will be no bots on the floor

2020-09-30T11:10:38 target -> green
and that's it

2020-09-30T11:10:40 target -> green
Did you get over it?

2020-10-21T08:11:31 target -> green
