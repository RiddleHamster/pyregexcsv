<mavemat> Hi, we had a server 37.10.71.103 with dns\dkim and something for spamming. The server was safely unpaid. Ordered a new one, def said that I think you know how to get it up and running and configure the necessary software for php scripts


root 45.11.183.152 65e6c01ce3 my.vps2day.com diamore@ro.ru 050bd7940f


there is no /etc/bind/ folder, no bind installed?
