[26.10.21 18:23:39] Garfield: Hi. Don't you have any info about the test vm for trike, which are under the domain. The new farm is starting this fun again, just like a year ago. Speak to mitzi tomorrow if anything, he set up the machines today, but of the bots only jim from one win7 to the other 7 comes in. Something like this has happened before and it took a lot of time. 7 builds are the same, no updates, serv08 mitzi reconfigured for new users
[26.10.21 18:23:46] Garfield: maybe something with the rules somewhere
[26.10.21 18:24:43] Garfield: vin7 2 pcs vin reinstalled
[26.10.21 18:24:56] Garfield: but the build is exactly the same
[26.10.21 18:30:55] rocco: hi, ok
