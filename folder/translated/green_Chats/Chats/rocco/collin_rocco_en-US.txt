[04.08.21 07:33:53] rocco: it seems that they refused at the level of pads, decided through the admin
[04.08.21 07:34:20] rocco: or just block the janipots
[04.08.21 07:34:46] rocco: ok, we need to raise scripts
[04.08.21 07:34:57] rocco: send me the list, I'll do it today
[04.08.21 07:35:04] rocco: I'll tell demetrus later
[04.08.21 07:35:25] rocco: Yeah, all of it.
[04.08.21 07:37:43] rocco: no at the end
[04.08.21 07:37:54] rocco: It's going over the torus
[04.08.21 07:38:04] rocco: it might not work at intermediate
[04.08.21 07:44:58] rocco: Copy
[04.08.21 15:21:33] collin: BRo problem with today's addresses that demetrius gave for the new one
[04.08.21 15:22:01] collin: they are getting stormy every now and then with error ERROR_INTERNET_TIMEOUT 12002, then ERROR_INTERNET_EXTENDED_ERROR 12003
[04.08.21 15:22:09] collin: see what's wrong, try to fix it plz
[04.08.21 15:22:24] collin: these
[04.08.21 15:22:27] collin: ``
159.65.204.222
161.35.147.41
161.35.147.242
161.35.149.106
```
[04.08.21 15:30:38] rocco: i'll check it out
[04.08.21 15:47:49] collin: now 502 on all of them
[04.08.21 15:51:28] collin: and the second batch of addresses for today also responded 502 at all
[04.08.21 15:51:31] collin: bro help!
[04.08.21 15:51:38] collin: `64.227.73.32 64.227.73.80 64.227.77.160 64.227.77.21` - these ones
[04.08.21 15:53:09] rocco: now
[04.08.21 15:53:47] collin: all online is gone, now they'll praise us)
[04.08.21 15:56:04] rocco: where, at all?
[04.08.21 15:56:14] rocco: n aspam on target where?
[04.08.21 15:56:49] collin: new main online zero
[04.08.21 15:56:53] collin: last bot knocked 20 minutes ago
[04.08.21 16:00:11] rocco: and spam? demetrus about spam
[04.08.21 16:00:19] rocco: so which one doesn't work?
[04.08.21 16:00:24] rocco: We'll fix it.
[04.08.21 16:00:34] collin: He spammed the addresses, they don't work either.
[04.08.21 16:00:41] collin: but that's for later, the new main one first
[04.08.21 16:00:49] collin: spam is for tests only
[04.08.21 16:00:58] collin: on the new main - work
[04.08.21 16:01:13] rocco: okay, I'm on it.
[04.08.21 16:02:19] collin: what's the prognosis?
[04.08.21 16:02:37] collin: Zeus is asking
[04.08.21 16:03:03] rocco: i'm working on it, i think it's fucking 15-20 minutes
[04.08.21 16:19:09] rocco: check
[04.08.21 16:21:54] rocco: torus got cut off and won't rise, i don't know what's wrong, i did it directly, but i guess i have to change the proclu to another hoster and tomorrow i will have new proclu to flash it
[04.08.21 16:22:28] rocco: What's up? Online is up?
[04.08.21 16:24:46] rocco: maybe they blocked torus, vps2day blocked 2 chats for me, I had to get them back on
[04.08.21 16:25:24] collin: 159.65.204.222 161.35.147.41 161.35.147.242 161.35.149.106 - these addresses are 502 all
[04.08.21 16:25:44] rocco: is this a new one?
[04.08.21 16:25:49] collin: 64.227.73.32 64.227.73.80 64.227.77.160 64.227.77.21 and these
[04.08.21 16:25:51] collin: yes, a new one
[04.08.21 16:25:57] collin: these two sets went live today
[04.08.21 16:26:18] collin: they need to go up first
[04.08.21 16:26:35] rocco: Mm-hmm.
[04.08.21 16:26:54] collin: 161.35.147.110 161.35.155.92 64.227.65.60 64.227.69.92 - that's yesterday's 502 answers, it's better to raise it too
[04.08.21 16:27:48] collin: now only old ones are up
[04.08.21 16:27:49] rocco: It's fucking clear
[04.08.21 16:28:02] rocco: it's through the torus
[04.08.21 16:28:15] rocco: because they cut off torus, so they don't go
[04.08.21 16:28:22] rocco: I'll write it manually everywhere
[04.08.21 16:30:18] rocco: I'll reset them
[04.08.21 16:39:05] rocco: all should work
[04.08.21 16:43:23] rocco: I let them through torus too, but without padding
[04.08.21 16:46:07] collin: but only these three sets I wrote
[04.08.21 16:46:11] collin: or all of them?
[04.08.21 16:46:33] rocco: I don't know, what demetrus gave me for basic
[04.08.21 16:46:39] rocco: check everything
[04.08.21 16:46:50] rocco: probably everything
[04.08.21 16:46:53] collin: ah see partially work from 30.07
[04.08.21 16:50:42] collin: can you make new procles now to new main?
[04.08.21 16:50:58] collin: demetrius writes some problem, I don't fully understand
[04.08.21 16:51:12] collin: You have to register bazaars, get online
[04.08.21 16:51:54] rocco: Yes, you can.
[04.08.21 16:52:00] rocco: I told him
[04.08.21 16:52:10] rocco: let it go for now without procreations
[04.08.21 16:52:14] rocco: let go
[04.08.21 16:56:18] rocco: is everything up?
[04.08.21 16:57:36] collin: yes.
[04.08.21 16:58:07] collin: so what finally happened, not clear yet?
[04.08.21 16:58:19] rocco: I wrote.
[04.08.21 16:58:44] rocco: they shut down the torus
[04.08.21 16:58:56] rocco: and it won't go up
[04.08.21 16:59:10] collin: who disabled it, why?
[04.08.21 16:59:26] rocco: I don't know, it just shut down and won't come up
[04.08.21 16:59:33] rocco: I'm looking into it now
[04.08.21 16:59:36] collin: okay.
[04.08.21 17:18:18] rocco: I raised the torus
[04.08.21 17:18:22] rocco: something systemic
[04.08.21 17:18:28] rocco: but I still gotta change it
[04.08.21 17:18:47] rocco: check old bazaars should work
[04.08.21 17:23:29] collin: from 02.08 there are 3 ERROR_INTERNET_CANNOT_CONNECT, 1 - 502
[04.08.21 17:42:52] rocco: yes, we need new ones, I deleted them all
[04.08.21 17:45:07] collin: I already registered new ones
[04.08.21 17:45:20] rocco: Let the new ones
[05.08.21 08:56:12] collin: hi!
[05.08.21 08:57:09] collin: about router addresses - we got a problem there, that client's ip-addresses aren't passed to the admin
[05.08.21 08:57:32] collin: this can be solved somehow, we can think of alternatives
[05.08.21 08:57:53] collin: or there's no way, routers as destination addresses won't work?
[05.08.21 09:06:05] rocco: hi, I don't know, if only routers directly connect ip
[05.08.21 09:06:09] rocco: not through tor
[05.08.21 09:06:28] collin: directly to the server or is there an intermediate procracker anyway?
[05.08.21 09:15:03] rocco: even if you put in between, still open ip direct to the server
[05.08.21 15:26:42] collin: Bro didn't find out the reason why torus crashed on the interstitials yesterday
[05.08.21 15:26:52] collin: is it possible to repeat the situation?
[05.08.21 15:27:07] collin: especially while you're on vacation
[05.08.21 15:27:19] collin: can demetrius handle a problem of this magnitude?
[05.08.21 15:27:27] collin: in case
[05.08.21 15:29:37] rocco: yes there is something systemic just shut down and all, writes errors, and what they mean I did not understand, I ran it in the screen manually, about the fall off or not, now at demetrius scripts there is sewn directly to onion admin, this is proto2, new vpska is under the bridge, I will adjust it, demetrius will explain, how to switch if something
[05.08.21 15:30:25] rocco: there should be no repetition, you can always switch directly
[05.08.21 15:30:33] rocco: until we know
[05.08.21 15:31:22] collin: about requests logging on server by URI-prefixes - not ready, shall we postpone?
[05.08.21 15:31:40] collin: on the server and on the procs
[05.08.21 15:31:42] rocco: on pads?
[05.08.21 15:32:22] collin: we have two tasks already waiting for this opportunity, it's not urgent yet
[05.08.21 15:33:34] rocco: I will, look here
http://ahl2635xpv4usnedpqtu35qojrk2kfnk3erneuaipyxghasxsmxzrxid.onion:3000/d/-0HiUFWnz/analytics-nginx-loki-v2-data-source-promtail-v2-tool?orgId=1
[05.08.21 15:33:49] rocco: it's grafana plus njinx log collection
[05.08.21 15:35:03] rocco: https://privnote.com/hyn5y1Rw#IjSXVsCCK
[05.08.21 15:35:07] rocco: that's a pass
[05.08.21 15:35:10] rocco: admin
[05.08.21 15:36:07] rocco: it's based on access.log
[05.08.21 15:36:30] rocco: wait a while, it'll load
[05.08.21 15:37:14] rocco: you can also connect grafana-worldmap-panel
that's a geoip map
[05.08.21 15:37:33] collin: now what can I see there7
[05.08.21 15:38:06] rocco: it's work between the spacers on proto2
[05.08.21 15:38:24] rocco: so you can't see it?
[05.08.21 15:44:07] collin: here we made some prefixes in admin for example "/api/v1" and "/api/v2" and GET or POST requests go to them. And we need to collect log on these requests - date-time, prefix, client ipi, request details (all headers) - response details (all headers, response code)
[05.08.21 15:44:23] collin: you probably need separate addresses for them, without any filtering and blacklists
[05.08.21 15:44:38] collin: do you have any of these?
[05.08.21 15:45:16] collin: `And you need to collect a log from these passwords` - a log for some time interval from... to
[05.08.21 15:45:38] rocco: I think so, you can collect it all, I'll set it up later
[05.08.21 15:46:07] collin: okay.
[31.08.21 08:09:59] collin: hi!
[31.08.21 08:11:01] collin: 1) how do you do with logging queries, grafana?
[31.08.21 08:11:28] collin: 2) is there a solution for using router addresses as end (client) proclets?
[31.08.21 08:11:41] rocco: hi, I just got out yesterday, haven't made it yet
[31.08.21 08:11:50] rocco: before logging
[31.08.21 08:12:09] collin: got it, I'll wait
[31.08.21 08:12:19] collin: I took 1 day off yesterday myself, I thought you went out earlier)
[31.08.21 08:12:40] rocco: ah, not me too yesterday
[31.08.21 08:13:44] collin: still need instructions on how to flash addresses in BC pads - understandable to such an admin who never flash these pads before
[31.08.21 08:13:51] collin: and its update if needed
[31.08.21 08:13:53] rocco: and about routers, i don't know, probably not possible, because in routers there is proxying not through nginx, but through iptables, and i don't know how they pass headers
[31.08.21 08:14:36] collin: I need to have the manual handy with me and Elroy
[31.08.21 08:15:10] collin: in case there's no one who knows how to flash it - it happened in early August
[31.08.21 08:15:23] rocco: I will
[31.08.21 08:16:06] collin: about the routers - you wrote that you can do if they go directly to the server?
[31.08.21 08:16:18] rocco: maybe
[31.08.21 08:16:23] rocco: I didn't check it
[31.08.21 08:16:28] collin: but if it is possible, you can probably make an intermediate procco to receive data, convert it properly and pass it on
[31.08.21 08:16:30] rocco: I assumed
[31.08.21 08:16:51] rocco: I'll try to test it
[31.08.21 08:16:53] collin: see what you can do with it plz, together with Alphonse
[31.08.21 08:17:24] collin: Silver still wants to use such procles in BC
[31.08.21 08:18:47] rocco: okay, I'll try to test directly, and router-pavement-server
[31.08.21 08:19:09] rocco: I just have to clean up my mess
[01.09.21 06:27:14] collin: hi!
[01.09.21 06:27:30] collin: about blacklists on BC addresses
[01.09.21 06:27:44] collin: this rule doesn't work: ` 185.220.100.240 - 185.220.102.255`
[01.09.21 06:28:04] collin: I wrote to Demetrius the other day, today these addresses kicked me off again
[01.09.21 06:28:18] collin: fix it?
[01.09.21 06:30:10] rocco: hi, okay
[01.09.21 08:29:45] collin: ``
write to admins, they should have randomized SSLCipherSuite on the pads
```
[01.09.21 08:29:50] collin: do we have that on the pads now?
[01.09.21 08:31:15] rocco: I'll find out
[01.09.21 08:37:22] rocco: yes it does
[01.09.21 11:53:08] rocco: bro what do you mean by randomization, I thought you were asking about cert?
[01.09.21 11:54:59] collin: ``

[01.09.21 11:55:22] collin: protocol randomization for TLS handshake
[01.09.21 11:55:39] collin: which affects ja3s fingerprints (maybe ja3) - they should be different
[01.09.21 11:56:26] rocco: i don't know if it's enabled in config, but never changed it
[01.09.21 11:57:37] collin: you have to set it, ask Silver - he discussed it with someone from admins
[01.09.21 11:57:43] collin: apparently, while we were away
[02.09.21 06:16:14] collin: Hey bro!
[02.09.21 06:16:43] collin: you need 2 vm for tests, new tester
[02.09.21 06:16:50] collin: maybe he already wrote you - nick
[02.09.21 06:17:10] collin: manuel said to you about it - didn't lie?
[02.09.21 06:17:19] rocco: hi, this is demetrus
[02.09.21 06:17:32] collin: ok.
[02.09.21 14:59:07] collin: what about changing ja3s signature, will it work?
[02.09.21 14:59:15] collin: at least once a day, now it's all the same
[02.09.21 14:59:45] rocco: I'm working on it now.
[03.09.21 08:17:00] rocco: bro you wrote me a log, and something else
[03.09.21 08:17:36] rocco: n aproclays need to track where it comes from, ip, etc.?
[03.09.21 08:17:45] rocco: countries?
[03.09.21 08:20:35] collin: about countries, filters are on admin level
[03.09.21 08:21:54] collin: we discussed all this about a month ago, you wrote - do it in grafana, so I'm waiting
[03.09.21 08:22:01] collin: about logs
[03.09.21 08:22:11] collin: i think i saved it
[03.09.21 08:22:45] rocco: search yes
[03.09.21 08:46:48] collin: didn't find the correspondence, I wrote it separately:

you need to get a status on the BC's taps, for a pre-planned test
that is to say in advance: you will need a stat from date-time(later than the present) to date-time
it is a one-time tests will be conducted as needed, now on the turn 2 such tasks
the stata is needed selective:
- specify the proc addresses (end addresses on the client) - one or more
- specify prefixes (URI) in backend: one or several.
For each of them we need to collect statistics of the following format:
- ipv4-address of the client, date and time of the request - required
- request type (GET/POST), server reply code - preferably
- request contents (which headers and their values) - optional, if possible

[09.09.21 08:39:09] collin: today is the old one
[09.09.21 08:39:19] rocco: I didn't change everywhere
[09.09.21 08:39:24] rocco: only one
[09.09.21 08:39:28] rocco: I'll finish it today
[09.09.21 08:39:38] rocco: and start assembly line
[09.09.21 08:39:41] collin: okay.
[09.09.21 08:40:07] collin: there was also a suggestion - to change certificates on the procards in the machine
[09.09.21 08:40:37] collin: the keys at least - for each client's ipi / at certain intervals once per hour for example
[09.09.21 08:40:47] collin: is it possible?
[09.09.21 08:41:32] rocco: yes yes, and the certificates will be random
[09.09.21 08:41:40] rocco: everything will be random
[09.09.21 08:41:50] collin: great! looking forward to it
[14.09.21 09:19:36] collin: hey bro!
[14.09.21 09:19:46] rocco: hi
[14.09.21 09:19:58] collin: no addresses reserve for uk pads?
[14.09.21 09:20:16] collin: and also now amazon addresses can not do?
[14.09.21 09:20:32] rocco: no we can do
[14.09.21 09:20:59] collin: any addresses will do
[14.09.21 09:21:21] collin: demetrius says "no reserves, I don't know when they'll come", that answer doesn't suit Zeus)
[14.09.21 09:21:52] rocco: I'll give him amazons
[14.09.21 09:21:52] collin: you can do it in an hour at least, 4 addresses for the new main needs?
[14.09.21 09:22:03] rocco: proto2?
[14.09.21 09:22:11] collin: yes
[14.09.21 09:22:20] rocco: okay, I'm on it.
[14.09.21 10:24:47] collin: how are you doing on the addresses?
[14.09.21 10:27:04] rocco: I'm already doing it with ssl script
[14.09.21 10:27:12] rocco: amazon
[14.09.21 11:20:43] rocco: fuck, on 16 ubunta, does not work the script for the ssl, trying to do on the others, sorry for the brakes, but need to do it on the new ssl
[14.09.21 11:23:24] collin: got it.
[14.09.21 11:23:51] collin: take your time, for today I've made clean addresses from old ones.

[14.09.21 12:13:17] rocco: he should have rolled up Ubuntu 20
[14.09.21 12:16:00] collin: none of them work
[14.09.21 12:16:50] rocco: okay
[14.09.21 12:17:05] rocco: maybe I sent it to the wrong port
[14.09.21 12:17:16] rocco: which port is it?
[14.09.21 12:17:20] rocco: 12233
[14.09.21 12:17:46] rocco: I think it connects
[14.09.21 12:17:50] collin: port is always the same
[14.09.21 12:17:54] collin: check with alfonse which one
[14.09.21 12:20:48] collin: stand down for now, postman works
[14.09.21 12:20:55] collin: my checker won't work, I'll look into it
[14.09.21 12:21:21] rocco: yeah, I see the port is right
[14.09.21 12:21:35] rocco: server hangs up
[14.09.21 12:21:50] rocco: check everything
[14.09.21 13:36:21] rocco: n
[14.09.21 13:36:28] rocco: did you check it?
[14.09.21 13:43:56] collin: it doesn't work in my code
[14.09.21 13:44:05] collin: what's TLS1.2 only?
[14.09.21 13:45:06] collin: connects to 1.2 - some kind of error, to 1.0 address says "protocol not supported"
[14.09.21 13:46:59] rocco: yes
[14.09.21 13:47:22] rocco: okay
[14.09.21 13:48:12] rocco: probably because of the ciphers
[14.09.21 13:48:30] rocco: tried them all?
[14.09.21 13:48:49] collin: and he writes another error in the browser
[14.09.21 13:49:11] collin: before it was "self-signed certificate" on the addresses, now it's SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER
[14.09.21 13:50:27] rocco: okay, leave them for now
[14.09.21 13:50:37] rocco: let me think about what
[14.09.21 14:17:26] collin: all the same ja3s print didn't change
[14.09.21 14:17:34] collin: the first handshake, it's the same as it always was
[14.09.21 14:17:40] collin: ``

```
[14.09.21 14:18:21] rocco: strange, ok I'll test it
[14.09.21 14:18:24] collin: the only time 08.09 was a different print and everything worked correctly then
[14.09.21 14:18:26] collin: that was it

[14.09.21 14:19:11] rocco: i got it, i'll do manual settings and check
[14.09.21 14:20:11] collin: something was changed with the certificate, there should be different cipher settings
[14.09.21 14:20:24] collin: i.e. elliptic curves used are 65281-11-35-23 65281-23 this should be changed
[14.09.21 14:28:14] rocco: look at this one
https://54.183.0.212/
[14.09.21 14:41:02] collin: the same and ja3s the same
[14.09.21 14:42:37] rocco: I'll try another one
[15.09.21 08:07:25] collin: hi!
[15.09.21 08:07:42] collin: can you make addresses for new main? Need 4 of them.
[15.09.21 08:07:44] rocco: Hi.
[15.09.21 08:07:48] collin: demetrius sent you
[15.09.21 08:07:50] collin: ``
I gave them to rocco. The generation seems to be working, he should reflash it already to get it right
```
[15.09.21 08:07:58] rocco: Yes, I have them, I'm trying to figure out the cipher
[15.09.21 08:08:20] collin: if they do not work so far, you need the old scheme, because you need addresses in an hour functional
[15.09.21 08:08:27] rocco: I'll do it manually, 5 min.
[15.09.21 08:08:27] collin: not like yesterday, can't wait till tonight
[15.09.21 08:17:53] rocco: ``
ok: [185.163.45.140]

```
[15.09.21 08:17:56] rocco: Come on.
[15.09.21 08:17:59] rocco: check
[15.09.21 08:33:05] rocco: how's the print?
[15.09.21 08:36:47] collin: 64.227.72.83 64.225.67.166 - not working
[15.09.21 08:37:49] rocco: It works for me
[15.09.21 08:45:47] collin: Bro, you gotta get the BC algorithm to work
[15.09.21 08:46:01] collin: Same thing as yesterday, certificate error
[15.09.21 08:46:26] collin: You can do the addresses by the old scheme, I have no time to experiment now
[15.09.21 08:47:01] rocco: okay, I'll reset it
[15.09.21 08:52:56] rocco: check it
[15.09.21 08:55:56] collin: 185.163.45.140 - this address is very messy, you can change it
[15.09.21 08:56:11] collin: 5 detects https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/185.163.45.140
[15.09.21 08:56:40] rocco: ok
[15.09.21 09:18:21] collin: can you change?
[15.09.21 09:23:40] rocco: yes, I had to register a new one, no one has any stock
[15.09.21 09:23:46] rocco: I'll flash it.
[15.09.21 09:56:08] rocco: sorry, forgot
[15.09.21 09:56:09] rocco: 194.76.227.21
[15.09.21 09:56:14] rocco: ready
[15.09.21 09:59:36] collin: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/194.76.227.21
[15.09.21 09:59:43] collin: this one's even dirtier
[15.09.21 09:59:56] collin: we need clean addresses, no more than 1 red sign, ideally no red signs
[15.09.21 10:04:46] rocco: shit, ok, we have to register with another hoster again
[9/15/21 10:06:29] rocco: Check this one, 195.149.87.46.
[15.09.21 10:06:39] rocco: I'll upload it to him if anything
[15.09.21 10:24:59] collin: I already gave out the addresses for today
[15.09.21 10:25:17] rocco: 195.149.87.46
[15.09.21 10:25:19] collin: you can provide reserve for BC, so there would be at least 8 of them in stock always?
[15.09.21 10:25:22] collin: pure
[15.09.21 10:25:27] rocco: you can give me that one too
[15.09.21 10:25:52] collin: I also take reserve from Franz, but it's not smooth there either - half dirty, half not working after a week...
[15.09.21 10:26:29] collin: about the problem with randomization of the ciphers - looks like the problem is that standard wind's library (used in BC) supports not all variants of the ciphers
[15.09.21 10:26:40] collin: only compatible ones can be used
[15.09.21 10:26:55] collin: this is the list in the windows designation:

[21.09.21 06:37:25] rocco: bro, check the gasket
[21.09.21 06:37:29] rocco: after the script
[21.09.21 06:37:36] rocco: I think I found a mistake
[21.09.21 06:37:37] rocco: https://194.135.33.207/
[21.09.21 06:37:41] collin: and check how blacklists work please - it skips addresses from rules
[21.09.21 06:37:45] rocco: it's for proto2
[21.09.21 06:37:48] collin: in the last 24 hours these ones:
[21.09.21 06:37:49] collin: 5.187.21.98, 185.220.100.240 to 185.220.102.255, 204.101.161.14 to 204.101.161.19, 167.114.209.103
[21.09.21 06:37:56] rocco: okay.
[21.09.21 06:37:59] rocco: Check.
[21.09.21 06:38:07] rocco: check gasket
[21.09.21 06:38:15] rocco: it's after the kiefer generation
[21.09.21 06:38:27] rocco: took the ciphers from your table
[21.09.21 06:38:31] rocco: takes
[21.09.21 06:38:40] collin: okay, let me check
[21.09.21 06:42:04] collin: padding works, but the cipher set is the same as before
[21.09.21 06:42:16] collin: i.e. ja3s didn't change
[21.09.21 06:42:49] rocco: now sec, the bug was not in the ciphers, but in the certificate generation, now I'll play with the ciphers
[21.09.21 06:49:27] collin: Bro, I need new addresses today - 2 packs of 4
[21.09.21 06:49:39] collin: no demetrius, and we gotta get ready
[21.09.21 06:49:49] collin: is it coming soon, or will you do it?
[21.09.21 06:50:41] rocco: yeah, i think it'll come out, if it doesn't, i'll do it
[21.09.21 06:50:49] collin: okay, I'll wait another half hour
[21.09.21 06:58:50] rocco: check
https://194.135.33.207/
[21.09.21 07:09:53] collin: same
[21.09.21 07:10:33] rocco: ok
[21.09.21 07:20:27] rocco: check it changed?
[21.09.21 07:20:46] rocco: demeter does?
[21.09.21 07:21:02] collin: yes, I ordered working addresses from him
[21.09.21 07:21:38] collin: no change
[21.09.21 07:21:57] rocco: ja3?
[21.09.21 07:22:08] collin: ja3s the same
[21.09.21 07:22:15] rocco: okay

[21.09.21 07:37:36] rocco: not to bother you

[21.09.21 07:40:51] rocco: thanks
[22.09.21 06:14:25] collin: hey bro!
[22.09.21 06:15:05] collin: what's up with the blacklists at pad level, did you check?
[22.09.21 06:15:27] collin: 5.187.21.98 167.114.209.103 104.237.193.26 - these are the addresses he knocked from last night
[22.09.21 06:16:07] collin: 5.187.21.98 - wrote about it yesterday, 167.114.209.103 - been writing about it since last week
[22.09.21 06:28:11] rocco: Hey bro, I'll get to it, but in principle demeter has all the scripts, you can also write to him, if he fails then I will connect, I just may not have time to do
[22.09.21 06:28:55] rocco: you always write him all the problems first, it's like the first line, if he does not work he tells me
[22.09.21 06:30:10] rocco: Listen, I do not understand how to connect ja3 into shark, there is a plugin for shark, and I'm looking for in my lin, vashe no folder even for plugins, what the hell
[22.09.21 06:30:23] rocco: you have everything on the wind?
[22.09.21 06:30:36] rocco: maybe it's better to have a winder on the deck
[22.09.21 06:30:44] rocco: I'll try it on wine
[22.09.21 06:31:13] rocco: do you have any manual how to connect all this stuff
[22.09.21 06:31:13] collin: `may I write him too` - I also write him and duplicate it for you (because the question is not solved)
[22.09.21 06:31:40] collin: I only set it up on Windows, I'll look for correspondence now
[22.09.21 06:32:05] rocco: yeah bro I'd appreciate it, I just don't want to spend a lot of time on the setup
[22.09.21 06:32:33] rocco: Demeter's coming out, I'll find out what's wrong with his filter
[22.09.21 06:32:41] rocco: I'll do it myself
[22.09.21 06:39:59] collin: didn't save the info, I'll write it from memory:
[22.09.21 06:40:04] collin: 1) I put wireshark
[22.09.21 06:40:33] collin: 2) I put plugin from here https://github.com/salesforce/ja3 - in folder C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins
[22.09.21 06:40:48] collin: there is one file to put there ja3.lua
[22.09.21 06:41:19] rocco: yeah thanks
[22.09.21 06:41:24] collin: 2) put the plugin from here https://github.com/kikito/md5.lua/blob/master/md5.lua
[22.09.21 06:41:33] rocco: I'll put it on the windup
[22.09.21 06:41:47] collin: into the folder C:\Program Files\Wireshark one file md5.lua
[22.09.21 06:42:32] collin: after that it works, on interception in Client Hello package appears ja3 section, in Server Hello - ja3s section
[22.09.21 07:09:48] collin: tell me, do you chat with the newbies now?
[22.09.21 07:09:57] collin: ojdglzhrquash4... which one?

ojdglzhrquash4... which one?
[22.09.21 07:42:44] rocco: demeter

[22.09.21 13:42:07] collin: Yeah, I got the procs
[22.09.21 13:42:47] rocco: probably have to manually pick up working sets

[23.09.21 07:08:33] collin: you put in a plugin, enabled packet capturing
[23.09.21 07:08:36] collin: next you have to send the packet
[23.09.21 07:08:41] collin: what do you send the packet with?
[23.09.21 07:08:46] rocco: aah!
[23.09.21 07:09:16] collin: different result if you use your browser
[23.09.21 07:09:24] collin: because the client part is different
[23.09.21 07:09:33] collin: address checker for workplace
[23.09.21 07:09:35] collin: I'll send it to you
[23.09.21 07:09:51] rocco: go ahead
[23.09.21 07:12:05] collin: so I must have given you a redundant list of ciphers
[23.09.21 07:12:16] collin: all of them are supported by Windows from 7 to 10
[23.09.21 07:12:32] rocco: it's not clear what kind of fingerprint it shows
[23.09.21 07:12:37] rocco: you
[23.09.21 07:12:39] collin: but the wininet liba used in the client part of the backend - there's less list
[23.09.21 07:12:50] rocco: maybe it's an admins print
[23.09.21 07:13:02] rocco: you have to change it in admin

[23.09.21 13:26:35] collin: he sends a request and gets an answer, so it's possible to intercept the packet
[23.09.21 13:26:54] collin: wait though
[23.09.21 13:27:00] collin: what kind of OS do you have?

[23.09.21 13:29:03] rocco: is it bdchk?
[23.09.21 13:29:18] collin: yes
[23.09.21 13:29:18] rocco: I'll check again at 10
[23.09.21 13:29:28] collin: I think I fixed it, I'll check it too

[23.09.21 13:30:24] rocco: I just need to figure out whose print
[23.09.21 13:30:49] rocco: I figured out how to change it
[23.09.21 14:00:44] rocco: it worked, I was racking my brain all day
[23.09.21 14:16:04] rocco: does test bro work like proto2?
[23.09.21 14:16:27] rocco: change ciphers on the admin and the same set on the pad
[23.09.21 14:16:42] rocco: it just doesn't work in battle
[23.09.21 14:20:02] collin: yeah proto2 is there
[23.09.21 14:20:16] collin: alphonse recently made a cast of the main new
[23.09.21 14:20:19] collin: to the test one
[23.09.21 14:21:02] rocco: yes then I will try on it, most likely it is a print of the admin comes, you need to do the same on the admin and on the pad most likely
[24.09.21 06:39:03] collin: Hey bro!
[24.09.21 06:39:10] collin: Demetrius will be, do not know?
[24.09.21 06:39:52] rocco: Hi, I don't know where he is, he didn't tell me anything, he didn't show up yesterday
[24.09.21 06:40:29] collin: still blacklisted on the proc, since yesterday evening:
[24.09.21 06:40:40] collin: 167.114.209.103, from these ranges: 185.220.100.240 - 185.220.102.255, 154.61.71.51 - 154.61.71.54
[24.09.21 06:40:56] rocco: Yeah, I'll get right on it.
[24.09.21 06:41:00] rocco: since he's not here
[24.09.21 06:41:11] collin: we'll need addresses for bazaars, but it's not urgent
[24.09.21 06:41:29] collin: I'll write after lunch if he doesn't show up

[24.09.21 09:16:49] rocco: yesterday I can't understand anything, 500 and 500
[24.09.21 09:17:02] rocco: and I thought my ciphers didn't work properly
[24.09.21 09:17:15] rocco: I've been going over everything
[24.09.21 09:20:46] collin: put it into Test Bot - try it now
[24.09.21 09:21:19] rocco: yeah, I got it.
[24.09.21 09:21:39] rocco: shit, I couldn't figure it out yesterday
[24.09.21 09:22:02] rocco: rebuilt Procla 200 times
[24.09.21 09:22:12] collin: well, request still passes, ja3s fingerprint is fixed
[24.09.21 09:23:16] collin: look, now it's the old one
[24.09.21 09:23:31] rocco: that's the thing, it didn't take it off
[24.09.21 09:23:46] rocco: just wasn't in the dump
[24.09.21 09:44:04] rocco: and check now 194.135.33.207
[24.09.21 09:44:15] rocco: I think jas3 changed
[24.09.21 09:44:23] rocco: I think I figured out how to change
[24.09.21 09:48:41] collin: yeah another
[24.09.21 09:48:51] collin: only then it switches to TLSv1 for some reason
[24.09.21 09:49:13] rocco: need to tune it up
[24.09.21 09:49:24] rocco: so I figured out that jas3 admins
[24.09.21 09:49:40] rocco: I put a spacer between them, and now jas gets it
[24.09.21 09:49:48] collin: but the seal itself establishes connection, first with the client, then with the admin?
[24.09.21 09:49:53] rocco: we'll just change everything on the pad
[24.09.21 09:50:01] rocco: I dunno bro
[24.09.21 09:50:01] collin: encrypts data, adds header with ipi
[24.09.21 09:50:13] rocco: got it like this
[24.09.21 09:50:27] rocco: if to do it with intermediate, it changes
[24.09.21 09:50:53] rocco: didn't want to touch admin
[24.09.21 09:51:11] rocco: because there might be errors with those ciphers
[24.09.21 09:52:30] rocco: I do not know how the connection, but whatever you did not aprocle jas not changed, but I remembered that you once said that you had changed somehow, and remembered that I had a couple of procreated through the intermediate
[24.09.21 09:52:47] rocco: here
[24.09.21 09:53:11] rocco: gonna play with cyphers and certificates on the crotch, and see how it changes
[24.09.21 11:11:59] collin: need addresses for new main 4
[24.09.21 11:12:24] collin: any oceans or other vps?

[30.09.21 07:35:21] rocco: ah yes
[30.09.21 07:35:28] collin: take from them

[30.09.21 15:45:53] collin: well, these two vps are fine
[30.09.21 15:46:11] collin: or leave them for tests?
[30.09.21 16:04:58] collin: Bro, Manuel gave me the "coba shk" files, says you did
[30.09.21 16:05:11] collin: sc_http_111_x64_dll.bin and sc_http_111_x64_exe.bin
[30.09.21 16:05:41] collin: a couple of questions - why are they "shellcode" - are they dll libraries, PE format?
[30.09.21 16:06:07] collin: and if dll can be done without IMAGE_FILE_RELOCS_STRIPPED feature, because our cryptors can't handle it?
[30.09.21 16:08:45] rocco: bro, i've been making these cheeks for a long time, and they're crypting fine, i just changed profile on kobe yesterday, and it stopped crying for some reason, i returned the old profile and it was fine
[30.09.21 16:09:12] rocco: it's easier to pick up a profile than to mess with cryptors
[30.09.21 16:11:22] collin: is there a parameter responsible for format?
[30.09.21 16:11:43] collin: those are different things, dll library and raw shellcode
[30.09.21 16:11:51] rocco: I don't know bro there's a lot to take apart
[30.09.21 16:12:00] collin: in the profile that Manuel showed - there is nothing like that, maybe by default dll and you need to add a parameter
[30.09.21 16:12:06] rocco: no 1 shellcode for dll, another for eqe
[30.09.21 16:12:19] rocco: I specialize in what to do
[30.09.21 16:12:42] rocco: no, that's the thing, I didn't change anything, I set it up and put it down
[30.09.21 16:12:50] collin: that's weird
[30.09.21 16:12:51] rocco: only changed cob profile yesterday
[30.09.21 16:13:07] rocco: that's just the profile
[30.09.21 16:13:40] collin: build-panel recognizes them by format, if it's a DLL - stubs for shellcode become inaccessible
[30.09.21 16:13:45] rocco: i think it's because of that, because they were crypting like hotcakes
[30.09.21 16:14:15] rocco: okay, let's see what I don't like about that profile
[30.09.21 16:15:01] collin: maybe they can be crypted as shellcode, but there's no such mode in the panel yet...
[30.09.21 16:15:19] collin: let's try it manually
[30.09.21 16:51:32] rocco: yeah, like bro, they've been crypting like shellcodes for a month now
[30.09.21 16:55:13] collin: in short, the shellcode is camouflaged to a PE file, the panel doesn't allow it: it recognizes the file as a dll and hides stubs with shellcodes
[30.09.21 16:55:26] collin: now let's try it manually, if everything is ok - we'll fix it in the panel, you can crypto
[30.09.21 16:56:56] rocco: ok
[30.09.21 17:13:09] rocco: all the bros work, thanks!
[30.09.21 17:13:30] rocco: maybe there will be other profiles, but they will probably work too

[29.10.21 14:53:38] rocco: which ones did you give today?
[29.10.21 14:55:02] rocco: I don't put a monitor on the procs
[29.10.21 14:55:08] rocco: but I can certainly
[29.10.21 14:55:28] rocco: it won't take long
[29.10.21 14:56:15] rocco: I have scripts for aprometheus and zabix, I just never bet on them, because they change often, but if you need to search you can roll them all
[29.10.21 14:56:41] rocco: let me do it, I'll send you a report at the weekend
[29.10.21 14:57:32] rocco: okay, with logs, I'm getting everything set up, I think, on Monday
[29.10.21 15:13:11] rocco: just like he said, everything's done

[01.11.21 11:30:00] rocco: I'll explain everything to him
[01.11.21 11:30:06] rocco: but he already did
[01.11.21 14:38:05] rocco: no bro, I'll run the block

[01.11.21 14:44:32] rocco: yes yes, found it
[01.11.21 14:44:41] rocco: running it now
[01.11.21 16:07:15] rocco: gave scripts to Gator
[01.11.21 16:07:27] rocco: if anything he will pick up
[01.11.21 16:07:29] rocco: well, he will
[01.11.21 16:08:02] rocco: there's everything and filter and tor check in the script
[01.11.21 16:09:31] rocco: he ran those too
[01.11.21 16:09:57] rocco: I just upgraded scripts, and forgot to turn on filter with tor check
[03.11.21 09:24:14] rocco: hi, yeah
[03.11.21 09:26:00] rocco: check
[03.11.21 09:28:01] rocco: probably, but last check was 2 min ago and it showed good
[03.11.21 09:28:44] rocco: yeah it's for ed?
[03.11.21 09:29:13] rocco: ok
[03.11.21 11:01:27] rocco: and old white domains work, you can't use them?
[03.11.21 11:02:28] rocco: I think all addresses work
[03.11.21 11:02:54] rocco: we haven't used them yet
[03.11.21 11:03:04] rocco: check everything, let's leave it
[03.11.21 11:03:54] rocco: ah just trade them in, got it

[04.11.21 11:49:04] rocco: what's the link?
[04.11.21 11:49:45] rocco: And throw all the procs to the new one
[04.11.21 11:56:23] rocco: okay, that's fine.

[05.11.21 06:55:09] rocco: yes, I will, because I now put all caps on the new main one through the center gasket, there should be less glitches and any admin can if what reboot the center gasket, or make a new one and put caps through it
[05.11.21 06:55:57] rocco: our end caps go ip to the center of the pad, only the center of the pad already broadcasts to the server via tor
[05.11.21 06:56:43] rocco: and I'll set up a backup
[05.11.21 07:49:54] rocco: what do you mean, backup?
[05.11.21 07:52:07] rocco: no I'll set up a dedication, I'll take backups from all my services and it will back up to our centralized backup, just in case I'll double transfer it to two places and then it won't backup at all like last time, I'll divert backups

[05.11.21 07:55:29] rocco: if I have time
[05.11.21 07:56:14] rocco: I need to configure backups, all the rockets, gits, admins, and I can not sleep peacefully when the backups are not configured)
[05.11.21 07:56:43] rocco: do instructions
[05.11.21 09:12:37] rocco: bro check, ip pass now?
[05.11.21 09:24:27] rocco: yeah, I sent it through head procco, headers have to be set up differently
[05.11.21 12:46:12] rocco: Yeah.
[05.11.21 12:46:34] rocco: by the way, you can ask Gator to do it
[05.11.21 13:03:12] rocco: about the profiles, I use several there
[05.11.21 13:07:31] rocco: two kinds of server for cobalt, and each with a different profile
1. it's a build with a sert on a white domain, the https listener gets a sert on a letse with a site.com address
2. it is also an assembly with a server on a white domain, but on the https listener gets a CDN domain of amazon or azur, that is https goes under the name of the CDN domain
[05.11.21 13:08:00] rocco: so there is a redirect from CDN to cobalt listener
[05.11.21 13:12:38] rocco: to the server where you bring up timeserver
[05.11.21 13:13:17] rocco: you set up on the server, do all manipulations, write the listener and it will connect to the server
[05.11.21 13:13:36] rocco: you can connect to it from any place
[05.11.21 13:13:58] rocco: bro, come on next week, I'll tell you everything in details
[05.11.21 13:14:17] rocco: I got stuff to do
[05.11.21 13:14:27] rocco: just can't get it done
[05.11.21 13:14:56] rocco: what do you want to optimize?
[05.11.21 13:15:15] rocco: or just understand the process itself?
[05.11.21 13:15:29] rocco: hide cobalt traffic?
[05.11.21 13:15:39] rocco: its weak point
[05.11.21 13:23:13] rocco: how?
[05.11.21 13:23:50] rocco: yeah
[05.11.21 13:24:13] rocco: well, for the bots to run the cob pailodes properly
[05.11.21 13:24:23] rocco: and the coba didn't stalk
[05.11.21 13:24:34] rocco: good deal
[05.11.21 13:25:28] rocco: that's the problem, you should analyze coba traffic, and see what's scamming, and take it out of the original load generation
[05.11.21 14:27:28] rocco: begemot
[05.11.21 14:28:51] rocco: Geez, he's a little more responsible, I guess.
[05.11.21 14:30:14] rocco: how much did you order?

[05.11.21 14:31:49] rocco: Oh, man.
[05.11.21 14:32:22] rocco: okay, we'll wait.
[08.11.21 08:12:25] rocco: hey, which one?
[08.11.21 08:14:56] rocco: Oh, man, I was watching the old one.
[08.11.21 08:14:59] rocco: now sec
[08.11.21 08:20:05] rocco: checked the old one this morning, thought everything was online
[08.11.21 08:20:12] rocco: mixed up
[09.11.21 07:44:19] rocco: Hey bro, send me the proc address for Target Admin
[09.11.21 07:45:06] rocco: yeah, I got it
[09.11.21 07:45:21] rocco: gator does
[09.11.21 07:51:29] rocco: they are on white domains, right?
[09.11.21 07:51:49] rocco: we should also do it via central procco
[09.11.21 07:55:37] rocco: they are all on domains?
[09.11.21 07:57:52] rocco: got it
[09.11.21 07:58:10] rocco: give me the domains
[09.11.21 08:00:01] rocco: just a list
[09.11.21 08:00:33] rocco: yes, I do, I want to check
[09.11.21 08:00:52] rocco: I want to switch everyone through the center procco
[09.11.21 08:31:14] rocco: yeah sec
[09.11.21 08:35:19] rocco: check all addresses
[09.11.21 08:59:19] rocco: yeah gator says abuses

[12.11.21 14:15:08] rocco: i think so, gator does it, i gave him a account where domains are more alive, it takes 5 minutes to flash the ansiblom
[12.11.21 14:25:17] rocco: those domains were registered at bitcoinsdomain, they put an abuse there for the slightest suspicion, I left there
[12.11.21 14:25:49] rocco: now gator will registrate on another one where I register kobas while everyone is alive
[12.11.21 14:26:41] rocco: Still fighting us on all fronts, it looks like the americans got them all
[12.11.21 14:27:02] rocco: kobos are pounding, abuses are hanging up

[08.12.21 11:02:28] rocco: or you can send me emc from yours?
[08.12.21 11:06:43] collin: yeah go ahead
[08.12.21 11:07:12] collin: give me your emc wallet, or the domains/addresses you need
[08.12.21 11:18:09] rocco: give me a purse

[08.12.21 11:22:48] collin: sent
[08.12.21 11:22:56] rocco: thanks bro!
[08.12.21 13:52:08] collin: Bro, about the admin BK Spam
[08.12.21 13:52:21] collin: Demeter says - you gave the command not to pay anymore
[08.12.21 13:52:41] collin: is it coordinated with alphonse? they're doing test work on it
[08.12.21 13:54:41] rocco: i understood that he skipped the payment and it was deleted
[08.12.21 13:55:36] collin: they are working with ryan on it as far as I know
[08.12.21 13:56:07] collin: I was reminding Demeter all last week that it's time to pay, and today he says he's taken the payment off
[08.12.21 13:56:30] collin: if everything is agreed with people - ok of course, if not - need to correct
[08.12.21 13:56:39] rocco: I have to back it up
[12/13/21 08:33:58] collin: hi!
[12/13/21 08:34:13] collin: make an address for the main admin panel
[13.12.21 08:34:31] collin: 2 sets of 4, total 8 pcs.
[13.12.21 08:34:39] collin: no Demeter and Gator
[12/13/21 08:50:09] rocco: hi ok
[12/13/21 08:50:21] rocco: 15 minutes to go
[12/13/21 08:51:33] collin: Bro, I need three sets.
[13.12.21 08:51:45] collin: 3 sets of 4.  - 12 addresses in all
[13.12.21 09:21:06] rocco: okay.
[13.12.21 09:21:42] rocco: Where the hell did they go, I thought I paid them for the pads
[13.12.21 09:25:38] collin: I have in reserve VPS, but only 6 units
[13.12.21 09:25:40] collin: I can give you

[12/13/21 10:52:49] rocco: some fucked-up vpbs
[12/13/21 11:10:01] collin: Which ones are mine?
[13.12.21 11:10:18] collin: What should be changed in them, I'll specify in the future when ordering
[13.12.21 11:13:01] rocco: yeah dunno, kakiete problems with updates and with the installation of software
[12/13/221 11:13:09] rocco: sometimes it happens.
[12/13/221 11:13:30] rocco: have to manually tester each one
[13.12.21 11:14:01] rocco: I'll get the bros together, pick up the good ones
[13.12.21 11:14:20] rocco: where the fuck did gator and demetrus go?
[13.12.21 11:14:44] rocco: they're needed for another project too

[12/13/21 15:13:00] collin: Bro very unstable today's procs
[12/13/21 15:13:08] collin: torus hangs regularly
[12/13/21 15:13:13] collin: anything you can do to improve it?
[12/13/221 15:39:20] collin: BK main (lch5nnzy) admin fee deadline - 12/15/2012
[12/13/221 15:39:37] collin: will demetrius renew it?
[12/13/221 15:47:58] rocco: is it a target?
[12/13/21 15:48:30] collin: basic old
[12/13/21 15:49:16] collin: `185.25.49.159` - that's probably it
[12/13/221 15:49:20] collin: but not sure about the address
[12/13/21 15:49:59] rocco: let him pay of course
[12/14/21 08:19:35] collin: hi!
[14.12.21 08:19:51] collin: since yesterday multiple bot bounces from addresses `40.94.*.*`
[14.12.21 08:20:02] collin: in yesterday's addresses, what did you do with blacklists all right?
[14.12.21 08:35:44] rocco: most likely, I did not run a blacklist, now I will run
[12/15/221 07:57:18] rocco: hey bro, I ran 185.25.49.159
[15.12.21 08:00:20] collin: Hello!"
[15.12.21 08:00:26] collin: saw it thanks!
[12/16/21 08:00:45] collin: hi!
[12/16/21 08:01:13] rocco: Hi.
[12/16/21 08:01:14] collin: About the coba
[16.12.21 08:01:34] collin: read manual you downloaded, all in all I understand
[16.12.21 08:03:29] collin: about shellcodes - is it HTTPS Beacon?
[16.12.21 08:04:10] collin: And do you prepare C2 for them yourself, or customers provide?
[16.12.21 08:04:45] collin: And another question - do you prepare them for Horse's team?
[16.12.21 08:06:45] rocco: I do everything.
[16.12.21 08:06:54] rocco: for horus too
[16.12.21 08:07:33] rocco: now, server in torus, listener through gasket
[16.12.21 08:08:04] rocco: like our gaskets for bk
[16.12.21 08:10:24] collin: c2 are universal, they can be used by any customer, or a specific master server can be flashed there
[16.12.21 08:10:26] collin: its address?
[16.12.21 08:10:58] rocco: c2 unique universal is made for the customer
[16.12.21 08:11:20] rocco: can be used by anyone knowing ip port pass
[16.12.21 08:11:36] collin: we don't have our own master server?
[16.12.21 08:12:06] collin: or c2 is connected by a client at once
[16.12.21 08:12:18] rocco: no bro, they get banned and it's a pity to have such a server for a long time
[16.12.21 08:12:30] collin: what does listener do?
[16.12.21 08:12:38] rocco: it's maxed out for a month
[16.12.21 08:12:56] rocco: listener makes a connection between pailode and server
[16.12.21 08:13:24] collin: does pyload connect to listener on startup, takes actual c2 address from it?
[16.12.21 08:13:55] rocco: i.e. it creates a load that knocks on the server, the system sees it as a connection via https protocol with the domain and with the data that you prescribed in the profile
[16.12.21 08:14:25] rocco: pailod yes it connects with either server ip or domain name
[16.12.21 08:15:11] collin: in paiload is one address/domain or several?
[16.12.21 08:15:15] rocco: now it's a pad address, not a server address
[16.12.21 08:16:08] rocco: you can have multiple listener http https dns, you can create many with only a unique port
[16.12.21 08:16:33] rocco: and when you create load you specify on which port listener it will knock
[16.12.21 08:16:55] collin: on https does the paiload knock directly to the server without a proxy, or using a system proxy?
[16.12.21 08:17:35] collin: or it can be configured when creating a paiload
[16.12.21 08:18:50] rocco: you can do it when you create a pailode
[16.12.21 08:19:38] collin: `there can be several listener http https dns` - do you do all of them at once, or some specific one, what customer asks?
[16.12.21 08:21:04] rocco: no, I do the standard 80 and 443
[16.12.21 08:41:28] collin: how can you see what paiload knocked on C2 - only with Koba client/main server software?
[16.12.21 08:41:37] collin: no way to see console command on c2, for example?
[16.12.21 08:45:07] rocco: there are logs
[12/16/21 08:45:17] rocco: weblog_443.log
[16.12.21 08:45:24] rocco: weblog_80.log
[16.12.21 08:45:43] rocco: you can see there what your test came for
[16.12.21 09:41:49] collin: Bro make me a x64 paiload coba and c2 test for it
[16.12.21 09:41:59] collin: with standard settings, like you usually do for Horse
[16.12.21 09:42:08] collin: not urgent, if possible
[16.12.21 09:56:46] rocco: ok
[16.12.21 10:19:15] collin: about procles for BK admins - I have a problem with them
[16.12.21 10:19:28] collin: during last week I've been waiting very long, at least 3 hours set
[16.12.21 10:20:04] collin: can you optimize the speed of preparation?
[16.12.21 10:20:09] collin: no more than one hour to prepare a set
[16.12.21 10:20:48] rocco: we need more registrations
[16.12.21 10:20:52] rocco: in advance
[16.12.21 10:20:54] collin: I order from Demeter - he pays, activates, waits every time
[16.12.21 10:21:02] rocco: I don't know why they wait
[16.12.21 10:21:03] collin: that's what I mean.
[16.12.21 10:21:13] collin: and by order to flash only and give out
[16.12.21 10:21:25] rocco: Yes, I'll write him.
[16.12.21 10:27:38] rocco: well, the problem is he's sitting and waiting to activate
[16.12.21 10:27:56] rocco: I wrote to make 10pcs every day.
[16.12.21 10:28:06] rocco: will be activated in the morning
[12/20/221 12:08:44] collin: hey bro!
[20.12.21 12:08:52] collin: need procs for new main admin BC
[20.12.21 12:08:55] collin: need another 4 pack addresses
urgently, at the bazaars are lied
[20.12.21 12:09:05] collin: something urgent, Demetrius and Gator are not answering
[22.12.21 14:47:26] collin: Hi!
[12/22/221 14:47:34] collin: Bro what's up with the addresses, why do they crash so often?
[22.12.21 14:47:50] collin: can we go back to the old scheme - do the sets in half from two different hosts?
[22.12.21 14:51:18] rocco: hi, this is not a question for me bro, but for the hosts
[22.12.21 14:51:29] rocco: also lie on cobs
[22.12.21 14:53:42] collin: no abusive ones in mind, maybe some new ones?
[22.12.21 14:54:03] rocco: I'll try some now.
[22.12.21 14:54:07] rocco: tell me
[22.12.21 16:54:01] collin: why did it take so long to flash your punches?
[22.12.21 16:54:08] collin: 4 procs, waiting 2 hours and not ready yet
[22.12.21 16:54:27] collin: it was faster before, can you optimize the process?
[22.12.21 17:34:38] collin: Bro here's the situation - I order reserve vps for uk, if necessary give them out for flashing
[22.12.21 17:34:48] collin: second time I can not flash these vps
[22.12.21 17:34:57] collin: `Permission denied, please try again. : unreachable"`
[22.12.21 17:35:03] collin: this is what demetrius has when setting up
[12/22/221 17:35:23] collin: can you figure out what's wrong - with the setup scripts or with the vpsc?
[22.12.21 17:35:51] collin: if there is something wrong with cps, you need to specify it, I will specify it when ordering
[22.12.21 17:35:59] collin: now only for the order I say you need debian 10
[22.12.21 17:37:19] collin: i just have working vpc-cards, i connect via SSH all ok, here is the picture in the console

[12/23/221 06:27:11] collin: Try my wpc
[23.12.21 06:27:18] collin: it's dirty, not good for work, for tests it's fine

[12/23/221 06:28:00] collin: also check what's wrong with vpc and why they can't flash
[12/23/221 06:28:35] rocco: about flashing speed, you have to tell Demeter to take some ports and flash them, it takes too long to flash through torus
[23.12.21 06:28:46] rocco: and change them
[23.12.21 06:28:59] collin: yesterday it turned out he had another problem - they just wouldn't flash, the process was crashing
[23.12.21 06:29:06] collin: and not only my reserves too, I guess
[12/23/221 06:30:01] collin: and how's it going with the test cob for me?
[12/23/221 06:30:04] rocco: it's just a manual action, you can run everything manually and find the mistake
[23.12.21 06:30:16] collin: I think this year she will have no time, let's postpone until the beginning of January
[23.12.21 06:30:33] rocco: you mean the test coba?
[23.12.21 06:30:49] collin: Yeah, I ordered from you about a week ago
[12/23/221 06:31:06] collin: now I'm just busy with other tasks, I have no time to look
[23.12.21 06:31:08] rocco: how do you make it with the certificate without, as I do for all through the gasket?
[23.12.21 06:31:25] rocco: okay, I'll bring it up when I need it
[12/23/221 06:31:42] collin: Don't do it yet, I'll write about it when I'm ready
[23.12.21 06:31:56] collin: and the main git ain't working
[23.12.21 06:32:04] collin: can you bring it up, or is it for adam?
[12/23/221 06:34:53] rocco: that's for adam
[12/23/221 06:35:53] rocco: I need to do a gasket and see what's wrong
[12/23/221 06:36:14] rocco: You could have figured it out by yourself a long time ago
[12/23/221 06:36:55] rocco: Did he make your gaskets?
[12/23/221 06:37:45] collin: I did, but again on that hoster
[12/23/221 06:37:52] collin: which we left a couple of days ago due to constant abuses
[12/23/221 06:38:01] collin: So I think for half a day again
[23.12.21 06:38:26] rocco: let them take from adam and make them

[27.12.21 07:35:39] collin: this:
[12/27/221 07:35:43] collin: ``
To create builds (bot init file)

1) Go to the \builder\ folder
2) edit \builder\config.bat file

PRJ_NAME - project name as in the admin panel
UPDATE_VER - version of the update
URL_PATH - path to push to
HOST_LIST - list of domains which will be triggered

ZIP_PASS is a optional parameter that sets the password for the archive to be created
```
[27.12.21 07:43:29] rocco: no, nitrous does the builds
[27.12.21 08:04:32] collin: do you pay for targeting admin or go to demetrius too?

[07.02.22 08:14:58] collin: my id is there, save it just in case too
[07.02.22 08:15:05] rocco: Yeah okay
[09.02.22 07:24:35] collin: hello!
[09.02.22 07:24:48] collin: about procs on routers
[09.02.22 07:25:16] collin: they cannot pass the ip of the client, and their ip is correct?
[09.02.22 07:25:54] collin: i.e. server accepts ip procles as before, if there is no ip client - extracts it from the data that bot will transfer
[09.02.22 07:26:19] collin: or approach will be different and the server part should be adjusted to them?
[09.02.22 08:51:53] collin: Bro, what about the routers?
[09.02.22 08:52:19] collin: except for the ip client transfer, everything else is the same as in the PPS or there are other differences?
[09.02.22 09:18:00] rocco: hi
[09.02.22 09:18:13] rocco: yeah
[09.02.22 09:18:24] rocco: router at the end, then the spacer
[09.02.22 09:18:49] rocco: no everything else is not working, we checked with you
[09.02.22 09:24:25] collin: we only checked one router
[09.02.22 09:24:33] collin: they have different hardware and OS
[09.02.22 09:24:43] collin: maybe something else will pop up on some of them
[09.02.22 09:24:46] collin: still have to test it
[09.02.22 09:25:09] rocco: no
[09.02.22 09:25:13] collin: we just stopped at this IP is not transmitted and that's it
[09.02.22 09:25:16] collin: we didn't check it further
[09.02.22 09:25:16] rocco: the rules are the same
[09.02.22 09:25:47] rocco: so there were even at work
[09.02.22 09:26:04] collin: yes there was a start
[09.02.22 09:26:05] rocco: the problem was only in ip
[09.02.22 09:26:55] collin: how to get external ipv4 address from the machine, advise me what methods you know
[09.02.22 09:27:19] rocco: okay, I'll take a look
[09.02.22 09:27:24] collin: except for HTTP requests like http://ifconfig.me/ip
[09.02.22 09:27:31] collin: preferably non-standard ways
[09.02.22 11:21:57] rocco: this bro won't do?
```
wget -q -O - ifconfig.io
```
[09.02.22 12:32:28] collin: advise about backups on admins, how is it organized now?
[09.02.22 12:32:31] collin: on the main one to start with
[09.02.22 12:33:05] collin: how often backups of database and software are made and checked, how automated is this process?
[09.02.22 12:33:38] rocco: I back up my database every day
[10.02.22 08:17:05] collin: Hi!
[10.02.22 08:17:21] collin: online lagged on the BC, on the procs tor lies like on all
need to pick it up quickly
[10.02.22 08:50:28] rocco: hi, I'll check it out
[10.02.22 08:51:04] collin: partially restored
[10.02.22 08:54:20] rocco: send me the link to enter proto2
[10.02.22 08:56:04] rocco: got it
[11.02.22 07:16:29] collin: hello!
[11.02.22 07:16:58] collin: can you give me a comprehensive list of answer codes,
[11.02.22 07:17:39] collin: which may not be from admin
[11.02.22 07:18:26] collin: that is either procles of any kind, in some abnormal situations, or the server before the transfer of control to the server part of the BC
[11.02.22 07:19:00] rocco: hi
[11.02.22 07:19:24] rocco: i dunno, didn't pedal such a topic
[11.02.22 07:19:40] rocco: you did something like that
[11.02.22 07:21:17] collin: okay, then
[11.02.22 07:21:34] collin: there could be response codes 500 or 404 from procles or from server (before BC backend)?
[11.02.22 07:22:26] collin: the answer is not needed right now, in principle
[11.02.22 07:22:43] collin: can you do the necessary research checks or delegate them to someone else?
[11.02.22 07:46:57] rocco: there was 404
[11.02.22 07:47:20] rocco: 500 is when proc isn't responding, bad request
[11.02.22 07:47:52] rocco: I'll take care of it
[11.02.22 07:50:39] collin: you need new clear machine on our proxmox, who can you order from?
[11.02.22 07:51:46] rocco: mizti
[11.02.22 07:52:13] rocco: did you put proksla on routers?
[11.02.22 07:53:04] collin: they kicked me the procs yesterday
[11.02.22 07:53:13] collin: only some strange, addresses and port, no credits
[11.02.22 07:53:28] rocco: what do you mean?
[11.02.22 07:53:29] collin: rather, the routers themselves aren't proksla
[11.02.22 07:53:34] rocco: it's all https
[11.02.22 07:53:42] rocco: yes
[11.02.22 07:53:46] collin: it's too early for them anyway, you should develop software first)
[11.02.22 07:53:51] rocco: just like normal stevans
[11.02.22 07:54:11] rocco: no need creeds, I already made them
[11.02.22 07:54:35] collin: aha, they are already made, just checked
[11.02.22 07:54:47] rocco: yeah
[11.02.22 07:55:01] collin: there are 20 pcs, did you flash the same amount?
[11.02.22 07:55:06] rocco: yes
[18.02.22 08:40:28] collin: Hi!
[18.02.22 08:40:49] rocco: Hi.
[18.02.22 08:40:56] collin: tell me, do we use or have we used gaskets for BC on cloudflare services?
[18.02.22 08:41:05] rocco: no
[21.02.22 08:32:43] collin: hi!
[21.02.22 08:33:10] collin: I need procles at least 1 set 4 pcs.
[21.02.22 08:33:21] collin: Will you make, or Demetrius wait?
[21.02.22 08:47:28] rocco: Hi.
[21.02.22 08:47:38] rocco: Yeah, he was here this morning.
[21.02.22 08:48:21] rocco: listen to the distribution of bots connects to the end, for example one knocked 27, the other 1 or 2
[21.02.22 08:48:36] rocco: how are the connections distributed?
[21.02.22 08:48:39] rocco: bots
[21.02.22 08:48:54] rocco: maybe that's why bad bounce
[21.02.22 08:49:19] collin: yes, there is no randomization in client when selecting an address
[21.02.22 08:49:32] collin: there is a task for coders, set it as a priority for all
[21.02.22 08:50:17] rocco: def suggested a couple more procles, and between them to distribute the end, but I do not know whether it helps
[21.02.22 08:50:36] rocco: the speed of the procles is good
[21.02.22 08:50:43] rocco: torus has good speed
[21.02.22 08:52:50] rocco: and ip via router, have you decided yet?
[21.02.22 08:54:32] collin: by the middle of March we are going to improve the router speed
[21.02.22 08:54:45] rocco: great
[21.02.22 08:54:57] rocco: things are not so good with vpc
[21.02.22 08:55:19] rocco: either dirty, or banned at once
[21.02.22 08:55:37] rocco: it goes bad through them
[22.02.22 11:25:44] collin: Hi!
[22.02.22 11:26:13] rocco: Hi
[22.02.22 11:26:21] collin: tell me what do you need to backup from BC servers when you completely shut them down and clean them up?
[22.02.22 11:26:39] collin: what you need and maybe some notes from alpha
[22.02.22 11:26:54] collin: in case there was a restart in the plan
[22.02.22 11:27:33] rocco: i think /etc /var/www and postgres dump
[22.02.22 11:28:11] collin: what server logs do you keep?
[22.02.22 11:30:11] rocco: yeah you can clean up the entire /var/log folder
[22.02.22 11:30:25] collin: you don't need them?
[22.02.22 11:30:48] collin: and DBMS in `/etc /var/www` too?
[22.02.22 11:31:33] rocco: the subd system is in /var/lib/postgresql
[22.02.22 11:31:42] collin: ok
[22.02.22 11:32:14] rocco: in /etc settings in /var/www admin in /var/lib/postgresql base
