[26.07.21 12:23:48] silver: Thank you.
[26.07.21 15:01:50] silver: one question
[26.07.21 15:02:07] silver: what is the fundamental difference between the gaskets for tric on routers, and gaskets for uk?
[27.07.21 15:53:11] silver: hi
[27.07.21 15:53:22] silver: what about onion2 domain transfer?

[28.07.21 08:17:07] silver: yum!
[28.07.21 08:17:17] silver: there's a sponge at stake, start over
[28.07.21 08:20:47] silver: let's try it for Bk as for Tric
[28.07.21 08:21:00] silver: cascade will slightly increase, because we are not giving up torus
[28.07.21 08:21:04] silver: yeah
[28.07.21 08:21:14] silver: on routers live long?
[28.07.21 08:21:28] silver: experiment
[28.07.21 08:23:10] silver: yeah, now the moans are coming from everywhere
[28.07.21 13:09:56] silver: on mongodb, go to osint chat room and write borne

[28.07.21 13:29:48] silver: how's the reverser chat going?
[28.07.21 13:32:26] silver: what about backups ? )
[29.07.21 08:25:28] silver: hi
[29.07.21 09:30:11] rocco: hi.
[29.07.21 09:30:44] silver: 1) on routers for uk. You're repeating the certificates again.
[29.07.21 09:30:49] silver: monblan.ua
[29.07.21 09:31:00] silver: there is no use in changing the scheme if the same errors repeat from time to time
[29.07.21 09:31:42] silver: about reverses - talk to Kermit
[29.07.21 09:31:46] silver: Raise chat room
[29.07.21 09:31:51] silver: the most important thing there is accounts
[29.07.21 09:32:13] silver: get user password hashes from the corrupted database and at least manually push them into the new database
[29.07.21 09:32:32] silver: which one?
[29.07.21 09:32:46] silver: Fuck!
[29.07.21 09:32:48] silver: that's bad
[29.07.21 09:32:54] silver: there's no backup
[29.07.21 09:33:08] silver: why is the base broken?
[29.07.21 09:37:26] silver: okay
[29.07.21 09:37:38] silver: Get the chat room up as soon as possible, people are worried
[29.07.21 09:37:59] silver: talk to Kermit, the two of you will solve it, he's a smart guy, he'll help you to rewire the base
[29.07.21 09:38:07] silver: I don't care if there aren't a couple of aces
[29.07.21 09:38:15] silver: You can start them up by hand and send the passwords to people
[29.07.21 10:11:51] silver: give Nikolai the password
[29.07.21 10:11:55] silver: And tell me, I'll send it to him
[29.07.21 10:18:54] silver: +
[29.07.21 11:07:45] silver: I see
[29.07.21 11:07:46] silver: thank you

[30.07.21 08:01:40] silver: 1. transfer the onion chat to onion3 before we lose them
2. we should do backups of chat rooms. So it won't be like with newbies.

[05.08.21 08:12:52] silver: they also had a chat room down there
[05.08.21 08:13:36] rocco: Yes, the hoster blocked it yesterday, on suspicion of fraud, I just barely got them to turn it back on
[05.08.21 08:13:55] silver: now get them all into the new chat room
[05.08.21 08:14:02] silver: because now I don't trust this hoster
[05.08.21 08:14:09] silver: and so as not to lose anyone
[05.08.21 08:14:18] silver: are they in the backup toad?
[05.08.21 08:14:19] rocco: yeah, i'll get a new server from someone else
[05.08.21 08:14:25] rocco: yes they are
[05.08.21 08:14:30] silver: the other one?
[05.08.21 08:14:44] rocco: i have access and demetrus has it
[05.08.21 11:03:25] rocco: the asperts were transferred to another server
[05.08.21 11:03:49] silver: which one?
[05.08.21 11:04:00] silver: i mean, is the domain the same?
[05.08.21 11:04:18] rocco: Yeah.
[05.08.21 11:04:55] rocco: about the tor address, demetrus made it there, he's got it if anything
[05.08.21 11:06:26] silver: so you get demetrius into all those chats, give him whatever he needs
[05.08.21 11:06:32] silver: and have him make an announcement there
[05.08.21 11:07:05] rocco: he's already in all of them
[05.08.21 11:07:21] rocco: I'm telling you, in principle, he already knows everything
[06.08.21 08:09:37] silver: hi
[06.08.21 08:09:45] silver: what's up with the async chat?
[06.08.21 08:13:51] rocco: what about it?
[06.08.21 08:13:55] rocco: it works

[06.08.21 08:14:49] rocco: I told you we switched to another server, let them use white
[06.08.21 08:15:22] rocco: onion will be different, especially v2 version
[06.08.21 08:15:29] silver: okay
[06.08.21 08:15:30] silver: accepted
[06.08.21 08:15:40] rocco: what's with the onion if you had a white address
[06.08.21 08:16:36] rocco: will they understand that you have to go by white address?
[06.08.21 08:16:59] rocco: I'm moving the onion address
[06.08.21 09:15:39] silver: liam doesn't know how to enter torjaba
[06.08.21 09:16:00] silver: liam doesn't know how to enter torjaba
[06.08.21 09:18:39] rocco: liam is where at asps?
[06.08.21 09:19:03] silver: yes
[06.08.21 09:24:26] rocco: he's off
[06.08.21 09:25:08] rocco: by the way, that https://gkipp4muy5josquz.onion worked, transferred
[06.08.21 09:35:23] silver: you gotta catch Liam, he's like a submarine
[06.08.21 09:35:28] silver: floats and sinks
[06.08.21 09:35:29] silver: )
[06.08.21 09:35:49] rocco: yeah if anything demetrus said
[01.09.21 11:59:58] rocco: silver: hi, advise me about SSLCipherSuite randomization, it's the first time I heard
[01.09.21 12:00:26] silver: hi

[01.09.21 12:01:52] silver: see the tribot tag?
[01.09.21 12:02:46] rocco: yeah i got it, but i think demetrus changes the cert in the settings, the print should change
[01.09.21 12:02:53] silver: no
[01.09.21 12:02:55] silver: you don't understand
[01.09.21 12:03:03] rocco: or should I change something else?
[01.09.21 12:03:18] silver: in order to understand, you have to read this article
```
https://engineering.salesforce.com/tls-fingerprinting-with-ja3-and-ja3s-247362855967
```
[01.09.21 12:03:26] silver: and understand thoroughly what it says
[01.09.21 12:03:45] silver: detects have *SOMETHING* different vectors for traffic
[01.09.21 12:04:00] silver: first detective vector is HTTPS SSL certificate repeatability
[01.09.21 12:04:35] silver: the second detection vector is JA3/JA3S detections - and you need SSLCipherSuite randomization to fight JA3S (but NOT JA3)
[01.09.21 12:04:45] silver: think of it as AB static detection
[01.09.21 12:05:02] silver: the third detection vector is neural network detections for traffic ripple
[01.09.21 12:06:01] rocco: yeah
[01.09.21 12:06:30] silver: on the link to sslbl.abuse.ch, and look at first seen and last seen dates
[01.09.21 12:06:34] silver: what do you think?
[01.09.21 12:06:42] silver: 4 straight years of JA3 tricks
[01.09.21 12:06:46] silver: 29k samples
[01.09.21 12:06:54] silver: don't you think that's a problem?
[01.09.21 12:07:03] rocco: a problem
[01.09.21 12:07:12] silver: decide, I said way
[01.09.21 12:07:38] rocco: okay, I'll think about it
[01.09.21 12:07:42] silver: There's one more thing
[01.09.21 12:07:55] silver: there is a negative from Prof and his people, very strong
[01.09.21 12:08:05] silver: you are admins, but you are a collection of people, not a team
[01.09.21 12:08:58] silver: there is no interchangeability
there is no training
there is no person who has to deal with all of the admin tasks, and who is fully aware of what's going on for all of the admin tasks
[01.09.21 12:09:24] rocco: for what tasks, I have never been approached by Prof
[01.09.21 12:09:25] silver: cobalt, anchor were not serviced
[01.09.21 12:09:50] silver: cobalt by hors, anchor was needed by prof
[01.09.21 12:09:58] rocco: i asked dums if you use anchor, he said no, i disabled it, no bots were hanging there
[01.09.21 12:10:12] silver: It's not Dums you should ask
[01.09.21 12:10:19] silver: anchor's teammate is @brooks
[01.09.21 12:10:25] silver: dums is a user
[01.09.21 12:10:31] silver: there are other users besides Dooms
[01.09.21 12:10:34] silver: socket for example
[01.09.21 12:10:36] silver: technologist
[01.09.21 12:10:47] silver: you can't turn off anchor to all users based on one person's opinion
[01.09.21 12:10:50] rocco: there was no Prof, I asked Dums
[01.09.21 12:10:59] rocco: no you don't understand
[01.09.21 12:11:03] silver: why did you ask the user and not brooks?
[01.09.21 12:11:04] rocco: there are a lot of anchors
[01.09.21 12:11:12] silver: well, I know there are a lot
[01.09.21 12:11:15] rocco: I keep track of them all
[01.09.21 12:11:54] rocco: but not to prolong empty infra, which is not used, I ask you if you need it, not to waste money

hello, if the stars align - we'll try to do it today, if not we'll take the alternate route, it will take a little longer

simple curiosity, what exactly had to be done that only people who are on vacation can do?

there's a lot tied up in rocco

suffer without it (

6:08 PM
so what exactly? domains? servers? it's fucking insane that the bot is down because one person isn't online right?
11:11 AM
https://185.25.51.104:9758/
the same codes
11:08 PM
What are the domains? are there any?
3:50 AM
The domains should be the same, they haven't been changed

    11:26 AM
    Can I have a separate panel with 20 domains?
    Abused what? Domains or a panel? It's kind of weird that the domains are the same.

[01.09.21 12:12:22] silver: look, this is the dialogue from the hacker chat room
[01.09.21 12:12:28] silver: first message August 13th
[01.09.21 12:12:31] silver: last message today
[01.09.21 12:12:49] silver: August 13, 15, 22, 23, 24, 25
[01.09.21 12:13:09] rocco: silver: I know, I got a lot on me, I'll teach you, I didn't have time to learn
[01.09.21 12:13:11] silver: problem not solved
[01.09.21 12:13:19] rocco: I raised anchor
[01.09.21 12:13:33] rocco: I don't know who, but what brooks asked for
[01.09.21 12:13:41] rocco: heros already made a cob
[01.09.21 12:13:52] rocco: and I'm uploading it now
[01.09.21 12:14:02] silver: you have no team leader
[01.09.21 12:14:31] silver: def not a team leader
[01.09.21 12:14:32] silver: neither are you
[01.09.21 12:14:45] rocco: yes, i'll take care of it, but i gotta pay my debts, and then i'll teach
[01.09.21 12:15:57] rocco: I created a group, I'll teach you there, and I'll give you a new one.
[01.09.21 12:16:14] silver: you must have tutorials, and there must be training
[01.09.21 12:16:25] silver: you must rotate people, giving them tasks not of their competence
[01.09.21 12:16:36] silver: so they would learn by their mistakes to apply this methodology
[01.09.21 12:16:57] silver: And to correct the workbook itself, because there are always omissions in them - I wrote it wrong, misunderstood, forgot something, swapped places
[01.09.21 12:18:03] rocco: Yes, yes, that's what I'm talking about, now I'll pay my debts and bring all the work to a common denominator, I myself can not cope with the amount
[01.09.21 12:18:07] silver: about ja3
[01.09.21 12:18:13] silver: you have to do it with all botnet pads
[01.09.21 12:18:19] silver: both trike and bk and anchor and cobalt
[01.09.21 12:18:28] silver: since this detector doesn't choose who to detect, it works for everything
[01.09.21 12:18:36] rocco: i already read about kiefer today you can do it in config
[01.09.21 12:18:46] silver: be careful with it
[01.09.21 12:18:54] rocco: but didn't specify how
[01.09.21 12:19:00] silver: you can make a lot of combinations there
[01.09.21 12:19:08] silver: there may be unworkable cipher combinations
[01.09.21 12:19:14] rocco: that's it
[01.09.21 12:19:18] silver: check your browser opens the seal
[01.09.21 12:19:28] silver: okay
[01.09.21 12:19:49] rocco: okay, we'll tighten it up
[01.09.21 12:19:58] silver: Can I have a separate panel with 20 domains?
here's the socket asking
[01.09.21 12:20:02] silver: anchor
[01.09.21 12:20:21] rocco: 20 dns domains?
[01.09.21 12:20:44] silver: I don't know
[01.09.21 12:20:48] rocco: you gotta have a separate guy to monitor it all
[01.09.21 12:20:49] silver: check with brooks what he wants
[01.09.21 12:21:05] rocco: and the socket is from whose team?
[01.09.21 12:21:13] silver: prof
[01.09.21 12:21:18] rocco: got it

[25.11.21 07:54:21] rocco: demeter will register a faster server for me, please pay, but put a bigger commission, so the transaction was fast, and Zeus asked to fast, I think I promised to give today

[07.12.21 13:09:41] rocco: anchor is knocking
[07.12.21 13:09:49] rocco: commands are passed
[07.12.21 13:09:51] silver: > if you set our smtp server
so it was tested
[07.12.21 13:09:59] silver: free mail doesn't work, everything is blocked
[07.12.21 13:10:09] silver: you should have asked me, it would have saved time!)
[07.12.21 13:10:12] rocco: they tested it so badly, I had to retest it for a week!
[07.12.21 13:10:24] rocco: brooks fixed code 10 times
[07.12.21 13:10:31] rocco: everything seemed to work
[07.12.21 13:10:52] rocco: now server side doesn't work if you connect external mail server
[07.12.21 13:11:09] rocco: I already tried everything and rebuilt and changed servers
[07.12.21 13:11:16] rocco: only works with ours
[07.12.21 13:11:32] rocco: client builds itself and works fine
[07.12.21 13:11:47] rocco: but the server somehow does not connect to external servers
[07.12.21 13:12:07] rocco: client -> server -> admin
[07.12.21 13:12:10] silver: for some reason )
[07.12.21 13:12:27] silver: I regularly bring up the topic of mail servers in 21st century
[07.12.21 13:12:55] silver: to make mail go to other servers, you have to give a shit about google and the majors and all
[07.12.21 13:13:02] silver: so they don't put you on their spam list
[07.12.21 13:13:17] silver: your pc will end up on some spambl.abuse.ch and that's it
[07.12.21 13:13:26] rocco: So I'm thinking, maybe to hell with them with external ones let our intermediate be
[07.12.21 13:13:48] silver: well, let's at least do it
[07.12.21 13:13:54] silver: won't work somewhere, we'll figure it out
[07.12.21 13:13:58] rocco: It's just a request
[07.12.21 13:14:03] rocco: mont chors
[07.12.21 13:14:05] silver: I'm being asked too
[07.12.21 13:14:18] rocco: will brooks be out soon?
[07.12.21 13:14:25] silver: I don't know
[07.12.21 13:14:28] silver: I don't think it's coming out
[07.12.21 13:14:34] rocco: (
[07.12.21 13:14:34] silver: we'll see
[07.12.21 13:14:37] rocco: shit
[07.12.21 13:14:41] silver: he got scared then
[07.12.21 13:14:45] rocco: I have the source code
[07.12.21 13:14:50] silver: yeah
[07.12.21 13:15:15] rocco: okay, I'll give it to mont, I'll check it again
[07.12.21 13:15:30] silver: yes, thank you.
[07.12.21 13:15:33] rocco: Why is Brooks scared?
[07.12.21 13:15:53] silver: he was changing bits and there tranz was lit as ransom
[07.12.21 13:15:58] silver: and sort of asked him to confirm who he was
[07.12.21 13:16:05] rocco: wow
[07.12.21 13:16:19] silver: there are few exchangers without AML left at bestchange
[07.12.21 13:16:39] rocco: I withdraw from elektrum
[07.12.21 13:16:40] silver: all exchangers where I changed, they checked for AML since summer
[07.12.21 13:17:10] silver: there is literally Keshbank, suex - both are under sanctions, plus they were searched in moscow a month ago
[07.12.21 13:17:16] silver: well, they get searched all the time anyway.)
[07.12.21 13:17:27] rocco: american bitches are all pinched
[07.12.21 13:17:37] rocco: They fucking piss me off
[07.12.21 13:17:47] silver: so he needs to mix the bitcoins before the white exchanges at least, or exchange them for litecoins or something else.
[07.12.21 13:17:58] silver: they pay us back unwashed, so keep it in mind
[07.12.21 13:18:05] rocco: yes yes
[07.12.21 13:18:09] rocco: I know.
[07.12.21 13:18:14] rocco: mix it up
[07.12.21 13:18:35] silver: Well, I still think it's a giveaway game.
[07.12.21 13:18:44] silver: amerians nailed it, ours pretended they did
[07.12.21 13:18:48] silver: We'll see.
[07.12.21 13:18:58] rocco: Yeah, I have that feeling
[07.12.21 13:19:04] rocco: big fucking game
[07.12.21 13:19:10] silver: The problem is that the Ministry of Internal Affairs itself is not our department, it's all bought up by americans
[07.12.21 13:19:25] silver: So, we should not fear the cops themselves, but the fact that they were bought by the pindos
[07.12.21 13:19:47] silver: And if you shout something, it is not your level, tell the FSS, I will call the press.)
[07.12.21 13:20:03] rocco: )) well, yes, you can do that now.
[07.12.21 13:22:38] silver: I was testing plutus.is
[07.12.21 13:22:44] silver: well, everything there is in manual mode
[07.12.21 13:22:49] silver: those are some familiar zeus/robin
[07.12.21 13:22:59] silver: and they're a mess over there
[07.12.21 13:23:10] rocco: ah ooh I'll take a look
[07.12.21 13:23:25] silver: until zeus personally started kicking them, nothing worked, support is silent, nobody cares
[07.12.21 13:23:47] rocco: Unfortunately, it's like this everywhere
[07.12.21 13:23:59] rocco: nothing works without a magic pendel
[07.12.21 13:24:03] silver: They have a variant there to order anonymous plastic and withdraw it from ATMs
[07.12.21 13:24:12] rocco: Wow.
[07.12.21 13:24:15] silver: I haven't tried it, it's a possible option
[07.12.21 13:24:30] silver: but there's a 2.5% fee only for withdrawal, plus the ATM itself has its own fee
[07.12.21 13:24:48] silver: plus ATM limits, you can hardly withdraw more than 100k rubles at a time
[07.12.21 13:24:52] rocco: well, you can withdraw everything in cash at once
[07.12.21 13:24:58] rocco: ah
[07.12.21 13:25:01] rocco: Damn right.
[07.12.21 13:25:10] rocco: I had an Advance Cash Card
[07.12.21 13:25:32] silver: you can put it in a cash machine a hundred times, withdraw 100k, put it in again, withdraw it again, then they get bored and the cash machine won't give it back
[07.12.21 13:25:34] rocco: they were cutting the limit there too until they closed the card for Russia
[07.12.21 13:26:00] silver: or run around like a moron in new and new ATMs) is also a good way to withdraw )
[07.12.21 13:26:11] silver: then your face will stick out) ATMs have cameras
[07.12.21 13:26:24] rocco: )
[07.12.21 13:26:42] silver: In short, the problem of finding good changelings is pressing
[08.12.21 09:31:12] rocco: koo
[08.12.21 09:31:35] rocco: bro tell me how can I refill my emecoin wallet?
[08.12.21 09:31:51] silver: hi

[08.12.21 11:28:53] silver: us or them?
[08.12.21 11:29:34] rocco: qbot didn't see that
[08.12.21 11:31:24] silver: yes anubis

[08.12.21 11:31:41] silver: or fix it yourself
