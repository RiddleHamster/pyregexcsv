[14.09.21 17:19:24] rocco: yeah saw that, I'll try to solve it, haven't dealt with it yet
[14.09.21 17:19:57] orval: I think the easiest thing now is to copy from the working profile of another cryptor
[14.09.21 17:20:10] orval: can do
[14.09.21 17:20:23] orval: if the problem is here on jenkins itself
[14.09.21 17:20:40] orval: can't be related to git?
[14.09.21 17:21:47] rocco: no, not likely, it can't copy a temporary file
[14.09.21 17:21:57] rocco: it goes to krypt
[14.09.21 17:22:04] orval: I noticed that the order of the git.exe command is different than others
[14.09.21 17:22:29] rocco: i'll see if your profile is configured incorrectly\
[14.09.21 17:37:21] orval: copied from work profile, same error
[14.09.21 17:38:02] rocco: let me check on the admin
[16.09.21 10:36:34] orval: hi
[16.09.21 12:00:12] orval: 123
[16.09.21 12:14:34] rocco: hi.
[16.09.21 12:17:21] orval: you haven't figured out the 4 cryptor?
[16.09.21 12:17:37] rocco: yes we did
[16.09.21 12:17:50] orval: great
[16.09.21 12:17:54] orval: what was the problem?
[16.09.21 12:18:41] rocco: the problem was in the folder test, and the intermediate file in Jenkins also test, because of that there was a hitch
[16.09.21 12:19:01] rocco: the folder was in the shield
[16.09.21 12:19:03] rocco: git
[16.09.21 12:19:11] rocco: in that assembly
[16.09.21 12:20:12] rocco: I named test file when I was making settings and it stayed that way
[16.09.21 12:20:44] rocco: now to rename it you have to redo everything
[16.09.21 12:21:13] orval: I see
[16.09.21 14:22:30] orval: thanks for the help)
[20.09.21 15:40:54] orval: hi
[20.09.21 15:51:52] rocco: hi
[20.09.21 15:53:15] orval: I wanted to put studio tools on Jenkins
[20.09.21 15:53:29] orval: you can do it with official installer?
[20.09.21 16:01:54] rocco: i think we deleted all the images
[20.09.21 16:02:04] rocco: you have to upload them again from torrents
[20.09.21 16:02:21] rocco: but you can upload them again on biterrent
[20.09.21 16:02:28] rocco: let me give you access
[20.09.21 16:02:30] orval: and from official?
[20.09.21 16:02:32] orval: I have
[20.09.21 16:02:41] rocco: I think you can
[20.09.21 16:03:08] rocco: don't break anything, put it on
[20.09.21 16:03:45] orval: okay
[20.09.21 16:19:03] orval: and there's some adate in there too
[20.09.21 16:19:07] orval: on the system
[20.09.21 16:19:18] rocco: update?
[20.09.21 16:19:27] rocco: reboot request?
[20.09.21 16:19:38] rocco: cancel it for now, then reboot
[20.09.21 16:19:39] orval: when I came in yes
[20.09.21 16:19:58] orval: webcompanion updater
[20.09.21 16:20:12] orval: canceled
[20.09.21 16:20:22] orval: I think they are still different processes
[20.09.21 16:20:38] orval: updater just want to update
[20.09.21 16:20:43] orval: the system wanted to reboot
[20.09.21 16:21:19] rocco: aah, what the hell, I'll check it later
[20.09.21 16:21:37] rocco: I turned off all telemetry there
[24.09.21 11:11:49] orval: hi.
[24.09.21 13:21:35] rocco: hi
[24.09.21 13:24:26] orval: do you administer the git you upload cryptos to?
[24.09.21 13:24:40] rocco: yes
[24.09.21 13:25:12] orval: do you know if stuffy has an account there?
[24.09.21 13:27:15] rocco: no such account for stuffy, maybe he uses another one
[24.09.21 13:27:27] rocco: check with elroy
[24.09.21 13:27:41] orval: yeah
[24.09.21 13:28:04] orval: and the repository needs to be configured somehow to make it work on Jenkins?
[24.09.21 13:28:29] rocco: no, it's already configured in Jenkins profile
[24.09.21 13:28:44] rocco: nothing on the git itself
[24.09.21 13:29:08] orval: just elroy always asked for read rights, i thought maybe he set something up
[24.09.21 13:30:29] rocco: i don't remember exactly about rights, in jenkins only takes and under what account
[24.09.21 13:31:33] orval: got it, thanks
[26.10.21 16:46:01] orval: hi.
[26.10.21 17:06:42] rocco: hi.
[26.10.21 17:07:09] orval: the git with crypts is down, is it for you?
[26.10.21 17:07:20] rocco: I texted adam
[26.10.21 17:07:32] orval: ok
