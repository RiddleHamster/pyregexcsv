[28.07.21 14:49:19] jefferson: hi.
[28.07.21 14:49:45] jefferson: elroy told me he ordered spambots from you
[28.07.21 14:50:01] jefferson: can we do more?
[29.07.21 09:38:41] jefferson: hi. here?
[29.07.21 09:39:24] jefferson: hello
elroy told me he ordered a spambot pad from you.
can we do more?
[29.07.21 09:40:23] jefferson: "rocco.
Ordered from rocco, usually 5 pieces, per https server address. Depending on need, there may be more/less.
He means he makes the config for the spambot himself... I don't know about that."
[29.07.21 09:41:45] jefferson: the server is where the admin area is, I take it? about the port, I'll check now
[29.07.21 09:47:34] jefferson: https://173.208.146.34:443
[29.07.21 09:48:03] jefferson: let's do 10 at once
[29.07.21 09:48:11] jefferson: I plan to run it in business
[29.07.21 09:48:31] jefferson: okay, 8
[29.07.21 09:48:42] jefferson: not important
[29.07.21 10:04:53] jefferson: accepted
[29.07.21 10:04:55] jefferson: thank you.
[26.10.21 15:27:46] jefferson: hi.
[26.10.21 15:27:49] jefferson: take it.
[26.10.21 15:30:11] rocco: ping
[26.10.21 15:30:41] jefferson: i got a job for testers. i sent it to manuel, and he sent me to you for some reason
[26.10.21 15:30:42] rocco: are you hash?
[26.10.21 15:30:46] jefferson: I'll send it over.
[26.10.21 15:30:54] jefferson: 1. You'll need 51 emails, you'll need full control over them.

2. You need to create a separate virtual machine with ms office 2016 or 2019 installed and, of course, outlook express as part of it.

3. you need to create the outlook express account from step 2 based on any of those 51 addresses. I recommend making this account on hotmail

4. From the remaining 50 addresses write any letter, even asiucaqchehoweifdjoji sdosdnjchjneciwe, to the email from point 3. The main thing that this letter reached and was accepted by the mail program from paragraph 2, and the letters were in the folder inbox.

5. After 50 emails will be accepted in outlook, create a checkpoint on the virtual machine (save its current state)
[26.10.21 15:31:35] rocco: Write to gator or mitzi, they are virtual admins
[26.10.21 15:31:51] rocco: they will decide who do
[26.10.21 15:32:01] rocco: I'm not dealing with virtual machines now
[26.10.21 15:32:04] jefferson: accepted
[26.10.21 15:32:27] rocco: write gator first
[26.10.21 15:32:50] rocco: tell them I sent to them, and let them decide who will do it or mitzi
[26.10.21 15:35:46] jefferson: I missed the part about you tell gator first
[26.10.21 15:35:53] jefferson: wrote mitzi
[26.10.21 15:37:10] rocco: yeah, just tell him I sent it
[26.10.21 15:37:19] rocco: not to delay
