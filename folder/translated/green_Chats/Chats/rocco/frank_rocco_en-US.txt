[30.09.21 13:33:03] frank: Hi.
I used to write on proxies for mav code.
Sitting around thinking, basically I'll write you, they die in a day or four. I have to write again, I then just bailed and started cleaning out the logs every day, because essentially because of the fact that the proxy has fallen away in the logs errors are piling up.
I studied that this code does what I found that it stupidly goes to sites and collects from them the title and description.
I was thinking what can be done with it, I had a thought, can I put a torus on the gasket, which you do? In fact, if he starts to go through a torus to these sites in theory should not so quickly rotten
[30.09.21 13:54:24] rocco: Hi, you can go to the server nator from the gasket
[30.09.21 13:54:35] rocco: n aon address requests will go
[30.09.21 13:54:55] rocco: to server on which port? is it open on torus?
[07.12.21 14:38:26] frank: Hi.
[08.12.21 14:14:21] frank: Hi.
Are you online?
[08.12.21 14:14:55] rocco: Hi.
[08.12.21 14:20:04] frank: I remember you still did a script at theo that ran the servers through security, at least it had a switch to ssh on a non-stop port, by a key.
We were discussing, and decided it would be good to run it on our battle servers on a trike.  There were some doubts, we want to systematically eliminate the possibility of third-party access.
Tell me please, can it be done if I give you ip\accesses, and whether you need ports which now go there from outside? And in general, what is needed, how long / hard to do?
[08.12.21 14:53:58] rocco: It's a quick fix from the ensibles.
[08.12.21 14:57:18] frank: ok, will the ports stay in place?
[08.12.21 14:57:54] frank: Ok, I'll talk to adam, he'll tell me the final decision, I'll write later
[08.12.21 15:00:21] rocco: ufw is turned on, then open ports that will stick out
[08.12.21 15:06:12] frank: Ok, I'll prepare the port numbers.
Probably tomorrow plus or minus at the same time I'll write what was decided.
[08.12.21 15:15:45] frank: Or if it's different... I don't know if it's the other way around... I don't know if it's the other way around...
Well, there are two complexes. first we will do it on one, and when we see that everything works, we will repeat it on the other.
[08.12.21 15:16:02] frank: I'll look at the tink by tomorrow too, how and through what it communicates ports, etc.
