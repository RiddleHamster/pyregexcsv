[01.12.21 10:39:30] lucas: Hello
[01.12.21 13:58:47] core: Hi, I have a message from you, but I don't see it
[01.12.21 13:58:59] lucas: Hi.
[01.12.21 13:59:19] lucas: it's obviously I wrote to a wrong person...
[01.12.21 14:15:47] core: ok
[03.12.21 10:20:14] lucas: Hi. Text me when you show up.
[03.12.21 10:47:07] lucas: You just got hired, right?
[03.12.21 11:01:58] lucas: Knock, knock...answer me)
[03.12.21 11:03:28] core: Hi.
[03.12.21 11:03:32] core: Yes, me
[03.12.21 11:03:50] core: The dialogue took a long time to load
[03.12.21 11:03:59] lucas: I see... let's talk about an introduction)
[03.12.21 11:04:40] lucas: Welcome to the team.
You need to unsubscribe in this chat frances, he's on financial issues. We need to let him know:
1. backup jabber on the public server (exploit.im for example)
2. who's your team leader
3. the date since which you work
4. what salary was negotiated for
Your teammate silver.
I'm running the crypto theme with stout, also a teamleader by position, but silver teamleader among teamleaders.
It's forbidden to use starphones at work... they leak like a river, no security
[03.12.21 11:05:18] lucas: If you have any questions about work come to me or stout
[03.12.21 11:05:34] lucas: Well, and for others, too, you can)
[03.12.21 11:06:35] lucas: About confidentiality of information - I think it's not necessary to remind?
[03.12.21 11:07:38] lucas: By the way, if the chat works slowly - try to change the chain for this site
[03.12.21 11:09:35] core: No, I understand it
[03.12.21 11:10:27] core: You mean you want me to write about it?
[03.12.21 11:10:48] lucas: No, I'll communicate with you about work myself...
[03.12.21 11:11:04] lucas: Or stout, if he's not busy
[12.03.21 11:11:20] lucas: You specialize in C++, right?
[12/03/221 11:12:54] core: Yes, that's right
[03.12.21 11:13:29] lucas: So, here's your Terms of Reference and study documents
[03.12.21 11:13:30] lucas: https://privatlab.com/s/v/W7j6OGOWAOsb2DaV3J3E
[03.12.21 11:13:36] lucas: password
[03.12.21 11:13:50] lucas: qevD4Lbdoxft7S$v[avnwocC6sv
[12/03/221 11:15:24] lucas: So, you read, study, get into the theme))
[12/03/221 11:15:46] core: I'd still like to discuss the release date)
[03 12/21/221 11:16:02] lucas: What about the date?
[03.12.21 11:16:02] core: I told at the interview that I work now, I need time to quit
[03.12.21 11:16:56] lucas: So you're still at work all day?
[03.12.21 11:18:01] core: For now, yes.
[03.12.21 11:18:20] lucas: I see. And when do you think you'll come to us?
[03.12.21 11:19:52] core: I can go to work on the 13th
[03/12/221 11:19:58] core: That's Monday.
[03.12.21 11:20:32] lucas: On the 13th write me and we'll start over)
[03.12.21 11:21:26] core: Ok
[12/13/221 06:11:38] core: Hi, I'm here if you need me
[12/13/221 07:04:44] lucas: Good morning.
[12/13/221 07:04:52] lucas: Already at work full time?
[12/13/21/221 07:07:08] core: Yep.
[12/13/21/221 07:07:24] lucas: Very good.
[12/13/21/221 07:07:48] lucas: Reminder, write @frances
[13.12.21 07:09:03] lucas: And the second, did you download the package of documents I gave you earlier?
[12/13/221 07:09:27] core: Yes, I did
[12/13/21/221 07:09:28] core: I'm looking into it.
[12/13/221 07:10:26] lucas: Welcome. How many years have you been in programming?
[12/13/21 07:13:20] core: Not much work experience, about 5 months. In general, I've been acquainted with the pluses for about 6 years.
[12/13/221 07:14:05] lucas: Do you know the principles of networks, addressing, etc.?
[12/13/221 07:15:22] core: Yes.
[13.12.21 07:16:18] lucas: Have you already looked at crypter's terms of reference?
[12/13/21 07:17:04] core: Not much detail, but yes.
[12/13/21 07:18:38] lucas: This is of course already "combat" ToR, but everyone has the same ToR at the beginning. Cryptors are workhorses that don't live long, so you have to write something new all the time.
[12/13/221 07:19:26] lucas: And at the same time you can evaluate the speed and quality of the coder)
[12/13/21 07:21:53] lucas: So, let's say, you look, read, study today. Still the first day when you can do it quietly, and tomorrow we'll talk about what you see approximately terms and difficulties in the upcoming work on the task.
[12/13/21/221 07:22:44] core: Okay.
[12/13/221 07:23:33] lucas: If you have any questions or anything else - write.
[12/13/21 07:24:40] core: Okay.
[12/13/221 08:28:31] core: Listen, I can't write frances, I can only write you in direct
[12/13/221 08:31:52] lucas: That's weird. In general find it and select write in private.
[12/13/221 08:33:06] core: I have such an option only when I poke you, and it says not allowed. maybe something with rights?
[13.12.21 08:35:03] lucas: So.... steps...In the general, select the top right members
[12/13/221 08:35:47] lucas: there you select all users and find frances, he's inactive now
[12/13/221 08:36:21] lucas: click on him and select direct message
[13.12.21 08:37:09] core: I can only ignore him)
[13.12.21 08:39:15] lucas: strange... I'll try to figure it out
[13.12.21 08:40:25] lucas: Is it only him?
[13.12.21 08:41:40] core: everyone but you
[12/13/21 08:46:16] lucas: Okay. We'll figure it out, I'll write.
[12/13/21 08:49:23] core: okay.
[12/13/21 08:50:02] lucas: Try clicking on the planet on the left
[12/13/21 08:54:13] core: it says You are not authorized to view this page.
[12/13/221 08:55:09] lucas: I see.
[12/13/221 08:56:03] lucas: While you can drop me a tutu for frances, and I'll send it to him.
[12/13/221 08:57:49] core: 1. jabber - aHgooLe@exploit.im
2. teamlead silver
3. working since 12/13/2021
4. bargained for $ 2,000
[12/13/21/221 09:02:40] lucas: ok.
[12/14/21 07:06:49] core: Hi.
[14.12.21 07:06:54] core: And what are the terms on the crypto?
[12/14/21 07:29:11] lucas: Hi. No deadline is given for the first task, but it's still looking at the turnaround time. Again, a git will be given where you need to commit to the project at least once a week. Better yet, more often.
[12/14/221 07:30:04] lucas: We'll talk a little later. Busy right now.
[14.12.21 07:51:58] core: ok.
[14.12.21 08:25:44] lucas: in place?
[14.12.21 09:29:11] lucas: text me when you show up.
[14.12.21 09:36:37] core: I'm here.
[14.12.21 09:39:48] lucas: apr?
[14.12.21 09:40:20] core: what?
[14.12.21 09:40:50] lucas: it's called a confidential conversation)
[14.12.21 09:41:24] lucas: I'll reset your account to git, when you go there, change the password
[14.12.21 09:41:34] lucas: core

asslkasjiurmg[z7s53edmncubh;12w9ck.czdjge47x2d8
when you create a new project, you can uncheck the readme box to create a
completely empty project
[14.12.21 09:42:17] lucas: see?
[14.12.21 09:42:49] core: yes
[14.12.21 09:43:31] lucas: must not have seen the messages, huh?
[14.12.21 09:44:25] lucas: your account on git:
[14.12.21 09:44:33] lucas: core
https://77ge2uapvcwymkkolxegeiyyhihpz3lfjq7dhoebpegc6wp2sv4wrtid.onion
asslkasjiurmg[z7s53edmncubh;12w9ck.czdjge47x2d8
when you create a new project, you can uncheck the readme box to create a
completely empty project
[14.12.21 09:44:45] core: Yeah, I don't see any new messages
[14.12.21 09:44:54] lucas: you can change the password to your own after login.
[14.12.21 09:45:55] lucas: do you see everything now? Something's slowing down the chat today...
[14.12.21 09:46:16] core: Yes, I saw it, I logged in.
[14.12.21 09:47:16] lucas: Good. On the git work you have a file in the passed bundle. On the frequency of commits I spoke above.
[14.12.21 09:48:21] core: I have to create a new project for crypto, right?
[14.12.21 09:49:07] lucas: Sure, you create your own project and put all the more or less changes in it
[14.12.21 09:49:23] core: okay.
[14.12.21 10:51:39] lucas: They'll add you to the branch of creepers, take a look, there are interesting things
[12/16/21 13:54:26] lucas: Hi. How's it going? You got your head working?
[12/16/21 14:10:06] core: Hi.
[16.12.21 14:10:14] core: I think I'm okay.
[16.12.21 14:10:36] core: There are some unclear moments, but in general I think that it won't be a problem to figure out
[16.12.21 14:20:23] lucas: That's good
