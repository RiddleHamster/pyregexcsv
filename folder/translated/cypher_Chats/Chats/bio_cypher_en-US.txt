[10.01.22 09:21:44] bio: hi. I need clarification on this company: Technosoft (www.technosoftcorp.com). This company is long gone, it was bought out, and the site redirects to https://www.apexon.com/, i.e. now it is an Apexon company. If you compare the revalue of these two companies, technosoft has it for 1B, and Apexon has it for less than 5k. Please clarify if you need to collect information on Apexon company. As far as I know, companies with rhubarb less than 500kk are not interested. Check pliz and let me know. Thank you.
