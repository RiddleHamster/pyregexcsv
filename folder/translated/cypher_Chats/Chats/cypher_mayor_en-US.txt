[08.11.21 09:54:35] cypher: Hi, someone made you a txt report, can I see it? To do by his example. Because all last week there was no talk about formats or anything like that.
[08.11.21 09:54:48] mayor: hi
[08.11.21 09:54:49] mayor: turn it on
[08.11.21 09:55:21] cypher: enabled
[08.11.21 09:55:59] cypher: Ah, I thought you finn in jabber, and turned it on there. I'll figure out how to turn it on here.
[08.11.21 09:56:23] cypher: Yeah, I see it's on now. Great.
[08.11.21 09:58:20] cypher: Are you in charge, as I understand it? And the final decisions are yours?
[08.11.21 09:58:48] mayor: Yes.
[08.11.21 09:59:17] mayor: people who demand "give me everything chewed up" like you are inflexible
[08.11.21 09:59:24] mayor: take it and do it yourself
[08.11.21 09:59:36] cypher: Just then we have a broken phone. One discounts one, fire accepts reports in pdf+csv format and no problems, and you already write about another.
I just need an understanding of how YOU prefer to read
[08.11.21 10:00:01] cypher: I understand about the rejection of pdf and other foramtes, no problem.
[08.11.21 10:00:03] mayor: I have a lot of other things to do.
[08.11.21 10:00:18] mayor: I'm not going to get into the details of your formats.
[08.11.21 10:00:22] mayor: shut up and listen.
[08.11.21 10:00:22] cypher: ok, give me a firm, I'll do it in txt, look it over, if it's ok - let it be canon then
[08.11.21 10:00:42] mayor: the final format will ultimately determine fire as your immediate superior
[08.11.21 10:00:48] mayor: I determine the security requirements
[08.11.21 10:01:03] mayor: your current mess doesn't meet those requirements, you're compromising the job
[08.11.21 10:01:28] mayor: as for "let me" - initiative is punishable
[08.11.21 10:01:39] mayor: when a person demands a job description, this is bad
[08.11.21 10:02:04] mayor: life is too changeable, for a job description, regulations, instructions could cover 100% of cases
[08.11.21 10:02:37] mayor: there must be a certain flexibility of mind to quickly respond to the unexpected
[08.11.21 10:03:10] mayor: if you need a format and can't do without it, fine, there will be a format
[08.11.21 10:03:13] mayor: but you do it yourself
[08.11.21 10:03:38] mayor: you write the layout based on your experience, the way you think it will be better
[08.11.21 10:03:55] mayor: you write it, show it to fire, he makes corrections, agrees with info consumers
[08.11.21 10:04:22] mayor: then you use this layout in your daily work until you are not satisfied with it for some reason - then the rules change
[08.11.21 10:04:31] mayor: what questions and comments do you have?
[08.11.21 10:07:35] cypher: There were no such requirements when I was hired. I specifically - I work for a salary, not a percentage, and as you pointed out above - initiative is punishable. You tell what company to punch, and in what format - I do.
Making layouts - this is a completely different task, which at the time of hiring was not negotiated at all.
Make no problem, then quietly waiting for the name of the firm.
No remarks to the bosses, my job is to do the work,
[08.11.21 10:09:31] mayor: if you're so tense about your work, you'll be working for us until the first non-standard situation
[08.11.21 10:09:39] mayor: then you say "that's not our deal"
[08.11.21 10:12:27] cypher: Let me clarify my situation:
I'm interested in results and work, and I like to get creative, to come up with something. But I don't like it when they then publicly start "fucking with you" for something that wasn't your fault at all. Serfdom was abolished. We were given instructions, told how to do things, we do them. Then you come in, and you start saying it's all wrong, it's all wrong, and you, since you're trying to figure it out, get a lefty job.
"It's not about the money, it's about the attitude," that's all.
I've been quiet for fire to get through quick contacts, even though it's kind of not part of my job description. I'm very loyal, and I like career advancement and stuff like that. But most important to me is a normal atmosphere in the team, not "slavery".
[08.11.21 10:13:00] mayor: a mess made by loki and snow, but you got into the bottle )
[08.11.21 10:13:29] mayor: why?
[08.11.21 10:14:57] cypher: I apologize if I hurt your feelings. Just as far as I understood, it applies to the whole team, because I, too, called the archive with the name of the company. So it did apply to me as well.
I just want us to work like clockwork and you get the most out of working with us.
[08.11.21 10:15:06] cypher: That's why I check the chat here on weekends too, just in case
[08.11.21 10:15:12] mayor: It's impossible to hurt me
[08.11.21 10:15:24] mayor: About the attitude, that's my position
[08.11.21 10:17:07] mayor: when a person gets fucked over, it's not worth getting offended over. There is a reason, and it is explained, sometimes in a harsh but vitally understandable way.
When I'm wrong, it's clearly explained to me by more experienced people, and I agree and accept it, regardless of the language.
When I am rude without reason, I am just thick-skinned and I don't give a shit what anyone says about me. There's truth in rudeness too.
[08.11.21 10:17:30] cypher: Got it, learned my lesson :)
[08.11.21 10:17:34] mayor: about the fact that the task is unexpected for you, you're not busy
[08.11.21 10:18:02] mayor: and the task is just for flexibility of mind, and flexibility of mind is very important not only in work, but in everyday life
[08.11.21 10:18:12] mayor: as for the general atmosphere - you'll see that it's good
[08.11.21 10:18:20] mayor: i never touch anyone just like that
[08.11.21 10:18:23] mayor: *so
[08.11.21 10:18:34] mayor: I don't have time to interfere with work processes
[08.11.21 10:18:47] mayor: I try to encourage creativity
[08.11.21 10:18:59] mayor: and I believe in self-organization
[08.11.21 10:19:01] cypher: Got it, got it. I'm waiting for fire then, I'll coordinate with him the firm, and I'll make a text file for you to look at (well, who he rents it to)
[08.11.21 10:19:43] mayor: about publicity - so we didn't cross that line in general chat, so you dropped your face somehow
[08.11.21 10:20:12] mayor: now we'll finish there and you'll continue your work in peace and fruitfulness)
[08.11.21 10:30:01] mayor: I'll explain a little more why it's like this
[08.11.21 10:30:16] mayor: why did you ask for a template and I told you to make it yourself
[08.11.21 10:30:42] mayor: our job is such that we very often have situations that we need to solve ourselves right now on the spot, immediately
[08.11.21 10:30:56] mayor: no one to ask
[08.11.21 10:31:14] mayor: no one will come and tell you, here's the solution
[08.11.21 10:31:21] mayor: go like this
[08.11.21 10:31:43] mayor: I started like this once, and no one could tell me either
[08.11.21 10:32:03] mayor: then somehow it turned out that the most effective people are those who come up with a solution to the problem themselves, without waiting for anyone
[08.11.21 10:32:11] cypher: I just work in parallel with the person, in approximately similar subjects, and when a situation arose there, that it was necessary to make a decision, and there was no decision, I made this decision.
Then he was like, "Maybe we could have done it in a different way".
That's why I'm already trying to be more specific :)
[08.11.21 10:33:00] mayor: when you're the only one who can make a decision here and now and it's wrong, you say so
[08.11.21 10:33:28] mayor: you say I have nothing to reproach myself with, there was no one, I acted based on my experience and knowledge in an uncertain environment
[08.11.21 10:33:32] mayor: I was wrong
[08.11.21 10:33:39] mayor: but where were you?
[08.11.21 10:33:48] mayor: and there can be no question
[08.11.21 10:34:08] mayor: I train people's initiative with such tasks
[08.11.21 10:34:28] mayor: you may make mistakes, but after 10 mistakes you will have the right solution, you will gain experience
[08.11.21 10:35:04] cypher: Yes, I agree.
[08.11.21 10:35:18] mayor: we work.)
[08.11.21 10:35:23] cypher: +++
[09.11.21 10:18:29] cypher: Good day, the basic rules I threw down (about archives, passwords, nondisclosure, etc.). Report has not done yet, because I'm waiting for the company.
[09.11.21 10:22:22] mayor: hi
[09.11.21 12:51:46] cypher: Hello again, sorry for the possible distraction, made this format:

[10.11.21 09:11:17] mayor: hi, okay
[10.11.21 09:25:59] cypher: Great, then we are waiting for you to publish it as a standard
[10.11.21 09:26:24] mayor: just tell everybody that it's standard!)
[10.11.21 09:26:37] cypher: Copy that, I'm on it.
[11.11.21 15:12:25] cypher: Mr. Warden, may I make a suggestion?
[11.11.21 16:31:09] mayor: tomorrow

[23.11.21 10:49:02] mayor: hi
[11/23/11/21 10:49:27] cypher: Not to order, but just something that would be nice to cover, but it happens sluggishly :)
[11/23/11/21 10:51:59] mayor: I'll remember
[11/23/221 10:52:01] mayor: thank you
