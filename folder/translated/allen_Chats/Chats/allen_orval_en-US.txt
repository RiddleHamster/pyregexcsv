[24.08.21 11:53:52] orval: hi
[24.08.21 11:54:29] allen: what orval?
[24.08.21 11:54:58] orval: 123
[24.08.21 11:55:01] orval: can't see
[24.08.21 11:55:28] allen: I don't see it, do it again.
[24.08.21 11:55:33] orval: hi
[24.08.21 11:55:48] allen: Hi.
[24.08.21 11:56:45] orval: a new crypt task has arrived, I need to check a series of crypts for fuzzy hash ssdeep
[24.08.21 11:57:07] orval: here are instructions
[24.08.21 11:57:16] orval: ``Official site
https://ssdeep-project.github.io/ssdeep/index.html

Link to download the archive with the binary
https://github.com/ssdeep-project/ssdeep/releases/download/release-2.14.1/ssdeep-2.14.1-win32-binary.zip

1. Unpack the archive
2. Build n (10) crypts with the same assembly
3. Put them all into one folder (samples)
4. Generate file with crypts' signatures:
ssdeep\ssdeep.exe -b ssdeep\samples\* > ssdeep\signatures.txt

5. Compare each signature with each crypt:
ssdeep\ssdeep.exe -m ssdeep\signatures.txt -b -a -s ssdeep\samples\*
[24.08.21 11:58:14] orval: download ssdeep tool, crypt the same load 10 times and compare hash matches
[24.08.21 11:58:46] orval: and try to get a minimum match
[08/24/1921 11:58:59] allen: Okay. Not now. In about 20 minutes.
[24.08.21 11:59:24] orval: ok, it's no rush
[24.08.21 12:01:02] orval: according to my feeling the coincidence can be reduced by shoving the following dereq:
unsigned int __declspec(allocate(".text")) array1[] = {...}
[24.08.21 12:01:18] orval: but that's if there's a problem
[31.08.21 08:44:04] orval: hi
[31.08.21 08:44:16] orval: any luck with ssdeep hashes?
[31.08.21 08:45:41] allen: Hi. Haven't done it yet - I have another task. For some reason crypter gives wrong DLL function address. I'm figuring it out.
[31.08.21 09:11:07] orval: got it
[01.09.21 10:49:57] orval: hi
[01.09.21 10:50:12] allen: hi
[01.09.21 10:50:34] orval: change your BK profile
[01.09.21 10:50:46] orval: ``// Example of func
__declspec(dllexport) int __stdcall func(HWND hWnd, HINSTANCE hInst, LPWSTR lpszCmdLine, int nCmdShow)

    // callback pseudocode
    return payload->func(hWnd, hInst, (LPWSTR)_STR("func"), nCmdShow);
}
[01.09.21 10:50:52] orval: the callback passes the function name as it is called in the crypt export table.
i.e. when renaming, a new name is passed
[01.09.21 10:51:14] allen: to documentation?
[01.09.21 10:51:50] orval: into code
[01.09.21 10:52:07] allen: I don't have it ready yet
[01.09.21 10:53:22] orval: okay
[01.09.21 10:53:32] orval: when you do this change
[01.09.21 10:53:41] allen: ok

[10.09.21 16:06:46] orval: in profile dll_shellcode_64_crypter3 in DllMain what are you returning?
[10.09.21 16:07:08] allen: True
[10.09.21 16:07:18] orval: always?
[10.09.21 16:07:25] allen: Yes.
[10.09.21 16:15:12] orval: generic exe->dll is not running
[10.09.21 16:17:20] allen: I asked Elroy to make a logged version. He kept silent for some reason...
[10.09.21 16:17:41] orval: you already knew the problem?
[10.09.21 16:18:01] allen: No. Each time it's new...
[10.09.21 16:18:23] orval: logged version of what?
[10.09.21 16:19:07] allen: My cryptor. For RUNDLL he did.
[10.09.21 16:28:22] orval: generic dll -> dll works fine
[10.09.21 16:28:28] orval: there are almost no differences
[10.09.21 16:30:41] allen: Yes. Only in exe->dll HollowProcess works from under DllMain.

[22.09.21 12:20:57] orval: hi.
[22.09.21 12:21:07] orval: just wanted to write about the malfunction
[22.09.21 12:21:37] allen: I know. I just updated it.
[22.09.21 12:21:47] orval: thanks
[22.09.21 12:21:54] allen: Should be ready.
[22.09.21 12:22:58] allen: I'm writing a krypt in asm in parallel. How's that in asm? There's a C-functional, too. In libraries.
[22.09.21 12:23:38] orval: that's good, but dangerous
[22.09.21 12:23:53] allen: But not completely. More asm code.
[22.09.21 12:24:41] orval: I wrote a crypt with no import or runtime at all and it's detected by windef and it takes a lot more man-hours to fix something
[22.09.21 12:24:43] allen: It's not dangerous. Do you know how many minimal EXEs there are in asm? 2048 bytes...
[22.09.21 12:25:05] orval: that's what I wrote
[22.09.21 12:25:13] orval: 5 kb or so

2) Full AB protection with mutex and interprocess data exchange.
[22.09.21 12:35:22] orval: ok, if so)
[22.09.21 12:35:35] orval: I'm all for it
[22.09.21 16:41:55] orval: and how do you encrypt load?

[30.09.21 11:49:37] orval: hi
[30.09.21 13:38:54] allen: hi
[30.09.21 13:42:39] orval: can you clean rundll_dll profile?
[30.09.21 13:44:19] allen: That's what I'm doing. I had to make sure it was going at all. It's an asm cryptor.
[30.09.21 13:44:50] orval: okay, is there a load?
[30.09.21 13:45:20] allen: I'll take it in cryptopanel.
[29.10.21 14:10:23] orval: hi

[01.11.21 12:14:57] allen: hi.
[01.11.21 12:27:42] allen: I'm struggling with 32-bit cryptor. I can't beat AhnLab V3 Light. Even with empty cryptor it gives out: Malware/Win32.Generic. ((
[01.11.21 12:47:18] orval: there's a new one, it's more important
[01.11.21 12:47:31] orval: I need to create a new profile
[01.11.21 12:47:38] orval: ``1.8 ET profile
Profile based on BK, but need to roll through exported functions so that their ordinals coincide with the ordinals of the export load
Call by ordinal:
rundll32 file.dll,#1

Example of setting ordinals of exported functions via .def file:
LIBRARY
EXPORTS
	Test1=Test1 @2
	Test2=Test2 @3
	Test3=Test3 @1
	
In this case rundll32 file.dll,#1 is equivalent to rundll32 file.dll,Test3

You also need to have the line 04D996FE94D3442EB1544EF742938E70 in the ready crypto

The order of the load start is the same as the BK profile
[01.11.21 12:50:51] orval: it's straight on fire
[01.11.21 12:53:51] allen: And it doesn't matter that there is a problem with detects?
[01.11.21 12:54:45] allen: And with an open load there are plenty of detects.
[01.11.21 12:56:42] orval: yes make a profile first, it takes a couple of hours to do, and then it turns out clean on that profile should be
[01.11.21 12:57:10] allen: Really, not WinDef.
[01.11.21 12:57:15] orval: and these exe_x86 constantly problems
[01.11.21 12:57:40] orval: plus if you sit on an empty project you might have to change the code a lot
[01.11.21 13:00:33] allen: String in HEX?
[01.11.21 13:02:16] orval: should check today, I'll let you know right away
[01.11.21 13:02:21] orval: you can do both for now
[01.11.21 13:02:27] orval: also
[01.11.21 13:02:34] orval: ``Each profile must support setting a text string.
For example
build.bat --string somestringthatusercanuse

Arbitrary length not affecting the execution (i.e. the string can eventually be patched by the customer).

Need to keep records of builds and loads.
What load, from whom received + date and time, what crypted, hashes.
Need to be able to give such information on request (for last two weeks).

[15.11.21 17:48:44] orval: profile et doesn't build
[15.11.21 17:53:50] allen: Hi. I'll have to take a look at it. I'm currently busy researching the crypts I'm getting. The thing is that the crypts made on the build machine have 2 detects. But the crypts made on my machine have no detects. The question is why. So far I found the only difference in DOS header DLL: they differ by 8 bytes in length and data offset 0x3C is different. NT headers are the same. I'm writing a prog to compare 2 exe files.
[11/15/21 17:55:37] orval: winmerge compares files
[15.11.21 17:56:20] orval: my crypts matched hashes with my manual ones
[15.11.21 17:56:38] orval: and this task is urgent
[15.11.21 17:58:11] orval: maybe the studio needs to be updated
[15.11.21 17:59:15] allen: Win merge compares binaries. That's what fc /b does as well. I'm interested in something deeper. Right down to the disassembler. I'll look at the ET problem tomorrow morning.
[11/15/21 21 17:59:49] orval: How much deeper? It compares every byte
[11/15/21/18:00:04] allen: not structurally.
[11/15/21/18:00:45] orval: look, we still need to take the file and make it clean, not do research
[15.11.21 18:00:57] orval: does your version of linker match the one on jenkins?
[11/15/21/18:01:18] allen: I have it clean. It matches.
[11/15/21/18:01:35] allen: But code does not.
[15.11.21 18:02:28] orval: but I can't make crypt your stub
[11/15/21/18:33:03] allen: Try it.
[15.11.21 18:33:16] allen: I corrected it.
[15.11.21 18:45:48] orval: it works, but there is a vatakat
[25.11.21 11:50:44] orval: hi
[25.11.21 11:51:44] allen: Hi.
[25.11.21 11:52:18] orval: jenkins is moving to a new server, which one is required for your crypt?
[25.11.21 11:52:44] orval: and can i get installation instructions?
[25.11.21 11:52:52] allen: VS2017 + fasm
[25.11.21 11:53:10] allen: The instruction is elroy.
[25.11.21 11:53:32] orval: can you dump fasm folder to C?
[25.11.21 11:53:55] allen: Yes. And, I think, that's all.
[25.11.21 11:54:27] orval: studios will now be from 15 to 22, but only Enterprise
[12/14/21/221 11:51:37] orval: hi.
[14.12.21 12:20:37] allen: Hi.
[12/15/21/18:51:27] orval: hi
[12/17/21 11:26:26] orval: hi
[12/17/21 11:28:01] allen: hi
[17.12.21 11:28:15] orval: We have a new addition to the crypto
[17.12.21 11:28:24] orval: ``The sieve function''.
Function to place data fragments in stub that can be
The external utility can patch it without damaging stub functionality.
The external utility is oriented to the macros placed in the stub.

This feature is enabled as an option for the crypter's build system.

It is expected that the created sieve will be filled randomly by an
external utility. That is, a series of crypts will be created based on a single crypt.
In doing so, the sieve should be sized and shaped to provide
maximum-possible or complete difference of samples by fuzzy
hashes in the created series. And this is a mandatory condition.

The sieve should be placed in all sections of the stack.

If this feature is active, the build system prepares a file with fragments
for filling and puts beacons of the following contents in each fragment:
struct beacon
{
  DWORD64 signature; // Usually 0x11223344FFEDA5D0
  DWORD size; // Fragment size (the beacon is in the fragment,
                     // it means taking into account the size of the beacon)
  DWORD crc; // checksum of the signature and size fields
}
The checksum is calculated in the following way:
DWORD ComputeBeaconCRC(beacon* bcn)
{
  DWORD crc = 0;
  BYTE *p = (BYTE*)bcn;
  for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(beacon) - sizeof(DWORD); i++)
    crc += *p++;
  return crc;
}

If this feature is not active, the build system still prepares a file with
fragments, but fills the fragments with random data.
The random data has to be generated with a hardware
randomization, e.g., the rdrand microcommand.
(Source code of random generator is available in C++, you may ask).
In this case beacons are not created, or they are created and overwritten by the build system
during filling.

It is worth considering that when generating crypts, randomization is important,
so it is advisable to prepare a sieve of different sized fragments for each
new build.
[17.12.21 11:28:48] allen: I'm aware of that. Elroy skimmed it to me.
[17.12.21 11:29:01] orval: ok
[17.12.21 11:29:19] orval: do you know how to do it?
[12/17/221 11:29:35] allen: Yes on asm.
[12/24/21 09:54:34] orval: hi
[24.12.21 09:57:42] allen: Hi.
[24.12.21 09:57:51] orval: what's your progress on beacons?
[12/24/21 09:58:36] allen: I haven't done that yet. They give a lot to crypto.
[24.12.21 09:59:35] orval: on cleaning or giving away?
[24.12.21 10:00:15] allen: I do.
[12/24/221 10:04:24] orval: do you profile leo?
[12/24/21 10:05:11] allen: Yes.
[12/24/21 10:05:45] orval: manuel needs a clean stub for monday
[12/24/21 10:05:48] orval: you got it?
[12/24/21 10:09:01] allen: I know. He checked with AVCheck, AVCheck gives out DYNAMICS, not static. His sources are all dirty. I managed to make absolutely clean crypts by statics yesterday
[24.12.21 10:09:25] orval: what makes you think it's for dynamics?
[24.12.21 10:10:37] allen: Check it yourself. Static on dyncheck is clear, dynamic - 3 detects. AVCcheck always has 3 detections.
[12/24/221 10:12:26] orval: I have them clean when I clean them
[24.12.21 10:12:45] orval: Maybe AVCheck updates them faster
[24.12.21 10:13:29] orval: moreover, how he will check the libraries
[12/24/21 10:14:04] orval: I have a delay of about a minute, but the results are almost immediate
[12/24/21 10:16:26] allen: I had a conversation with Elroy yesterday on this subject. His closing words:
`There's nothing to say to me about the case. Thought the avcek was watching the statics...`
[12/24/221 10:18:15] allen: I gave him the links to the check from dyncheck and avcheck. On avcheck you can't select the check mode: static or dyncheck. So it checks everything.
[24.12.21 10:18:56] orval: one does not follow from the other
[24.12.21 10:20:18] allen: Conclusion: you have to put your car with all the avs. And check there. And give admins the task to constantly update the databases.
[24.12.21 10:20:39] orval: Yes
[24.12.21 10:23:07] allen: I, until it is not set, where to check (setting should go from Buza (Silver)), I'll slow down with crypto. I'll make those changes, which are required.
[24.12.21 10:28:49] orval: check on dincheck
[12/24/21 10:28:59] orval: static
[24.12.21 10:29:19] allen: I was clean on dincheck yesterday.
[24.12.21 10:29:38] orval: let's do crypto
[12/24/21 10:29:52] orval: I'll redirect it to you now

[12/28/221 13:00:38] orval: how about the beacons?
[12/28/221 13:01:05] allen: Nothing yet - yesterday I cleaned 64 bits.

[27.01.22 13:55:50] orval: how's the cleanup going?
[27.01.22 14:01:33] allen: I'm reading about antiviruses for now. I need to do an AV detection. I have a problem. I use the creation of a named mutex to protect against viruses. It is the only one in the system. If it is created, I study to restart myself. If there is an error with code 187, I can work. After that I check on the parent. If not myself, then exit. All protection. I need to think about a more complex one. Maybe you can advise something?
[27.01.22 14:08:35] orval: I didn't take it apart
[27.01.22 14:08:43] orval: how would that help with static?
[27.01.22 14:10:20] allen: it helps.
[27.01.22 14:11:17] orval: maybe because you just added new code and the whole structure changed, I did that
[27.01.22 14:11:41] orval: import changed, file looked different
[27.01.22 14:12:39] orval: I understand that
[27.01.22 14:12:59] orval: but such code fragments will just quickly start giving you detections
[27.01.22 14:13:52] allen: And parsing by status is like this.
invoke GetLastError
add [esp], eax
ret

There is no direct comparison.

The import has not changed. As it was ExitProcesss() GetProcAddress() GetModuleHandle() remains
[27.01.22 14:15:02] orval: but how should it help with static?
[27.01.22 14:15:57] orval: if detected a number of attributes such as import table, compiler version, and already burned pieces of code
[27.01.22 14:18:49] allen: Import table. Maybe. I'm working on reading it from the TEB process now. Or I'll remove import at all.

[09.02.22 11:54:31] orval: but why, if it worked before?
[09.02.22 11:55:08] allen: I say Rewrite the whole thing.
[02/09/222 11:56:12] allen: From scratch. To eliminate importing. To leave only a few functions.
[09.02.22 11:56:20] orval: you just wrote something before, and now you're writing again
[09.02.22 11:59:36] allen: I don't know how to clean what is already written. AVs literally swear at everything... Even on an empty project...
[09.02.22 12:05:04] orval: all these changes don't change the code
