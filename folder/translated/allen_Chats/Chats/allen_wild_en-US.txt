[19.08.21 14:55:40] wild: hi
[19.08.21 14:55:44] wild: uno momento
[19.08.21 14:57:29] wild: dl6_release_nologs_group_6_ver_1_34_x64_rundll32.dll
[19.08.21 14:57:56] wild: only I made a bunch of 3 crypts, they all folded and I deleted them
[20.08.21 09:58:20] allen: Hi. What parameters did you set when crypting dll_rundll_crypter3? And where do you get dl6_release_nologs_group_6_ver_1_34_x64_rundll32.dll? It's not in the cryptopanel.
[20.08.21 09:58:40] wild: hi
[20.08.21 09:58:48] wild: no parameters set
[20.08.21 09:58:54] wild: I'll get it
[20.08.21 10:00:00] wild: can you see the wild tab?
[20.08.21 10:00:11] wild: if not, tell me where to upload the source
[20.08.21 10:05:41] allen: wild is not visible to me. there are folders uncrypted, bk and testBuild.
[20.08.21 10:05:57] wild: let's put it into BK
[20.08.21 10:06:36] wild: done
[20.08.21 10:07:01] allen: go ahead
[20.08.21 12:00:43] allen: you can try. I fixed everything in Jenkins. It wasn't configured correctly...
[20.08.21 12:01:33] wild: I'll try new build
[20.08.21 12:01:41] wild: or just for the test to tell you how it works or not?
[20.08.21 12:02:11] allen: try it for the test.
[20.08.21 12:02:15] wild: +
[20.08.21 12:17:24] wild: tested, no detects
[20.08.21 12:17:25] wild: great
[20.08.21 13:00:05] wild: okay
[20.08.21 13:00:11] wild: it looks like crypt 3 assembled
[20.08.21 13:00:30] wild: made 3 different ones, first two knocked down at once, this one is gone for a long time
[20.08.21 13:00:43] wild: now I'll wait 20 minutes if it doesn't knock - tell me if you check it out please
[20.08.21 13:01:26] allen: Try running it again. Here, I think the problem is with rundll32.exe.
[20.08.21 13:02:01] wild: I will try, now I will wait 20 min. Well actually the rest of them knocked it out at once
[20.08.21 13:02:13] wild: and before that today I did other ones too, there was a knock and a grip at once
[20.08.21 13:02:31] wild: there are assemblies that take a long time to knock, but the one I'm looking at now is fast
[20.08.21 13:04:11] allen: My algorithm is as follows: 1) A named MUTEX is created. If it's created, restart everything on the command line + wait 500 ms. If not, we check its PARENT...
[20.08.21 13:16:05] wild: doesn't work
[20.08.21 13:16:10] wild: make a logical version
[20.08.21 13:16:11] wild: ?
[20.08.21 13:16:35] allen: yes
[20.08.21 13:50:50] wild: yes, but I made 3 crypto logged source 3 stub, the log is not created
[20.08.21 13:51:03] wild: tested with test source - stub works
[20.08.21 13:51:10] wild: why it doesn't work and makes no log I don't know
[20.08.21 13:51:24] wild: I'll give you a logged source, please check what's the problem
[20.08.21 13:51:35] wild: don't run it on a working machine!

[20.08.21 14:07:23] wild: Thank you.
[23.08.21 09:00:52] allen: Hi. What command line parameters did you pass to rundll32?
[23.08.21 09:01:04] wild: hi
[23.08.21 09:01:24] wild: I didn't pass any parameters
[23.08.21 09:01:27] wild: or did you run

[23.08.21 09:02:24] wild: launch usually rundll32 file.dll,StartW

[23.08.21 09:02:42] wild: that's what they tell me I use)
[23.08.21 09:03:19] allen: what was the launch without bouncing?
[23.08.21 09:03:49] wild: I'll restart the timeline
[23.08.21 09:03:53] wild: 5 minutes)
[23.08.21 09:10:17] wild: okay
[23.08.21 09:10:40] wild: can't remember anything, I remember 3 krypt didn't work, I was testing it as I could, and I didn't create a logical log
[23.08.21 09:10:48] wild: go StartW
[23.08.21 09:11:01] wild: but GetRangeList is possible
[08.23.21 09:17:17] allen: GetRangeList is absent in original DLL of paleoad. Since the build was run without parameters, the crypter repeated the export table of the original paiload DLL. Which means that the GetRangeList call couldn't happen.
[23.08.21 10:30:14] allen: I'm getting everything executed.....
[23.08.21 10:32:09] wild: fine, i'll call cryptan
[23.08.21 10:32:32] allen: Really, machine without internet...
[23.08.21 10:33:18] wild: well, i need bk crypto now, so no check

[24.08.21 09:35:01] wild: hi
[24.08.21 09:39:10] allen: I made a logging of crypto start via DebugView. Stub value for the cryptopail: dll_rundll_crypter3_logged, Try your DLL with the logged function and DebugView.
[24.08.21 09:43:50] wild: accepted, I'll get a new build and test
[24.08.21 10:12:33] wild: okay, now I'll test it on the old build, no new ones available yet
[24.08.21 10:12:35] wild: unsubscribe
[24.08.21 10:39:22] wild: log file is not created in the same place where usually (by crypting out with another stub or running the source code, everything works), in the admin area it also does not work
[24.08.21 11:02:31] wild: I downloaded DebugView and run it with it.

[02.12.21 14:17:26] allen: I do not know. I'm all clear! https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/abbb6653306e974f57490bfb0d0e1a1e.
[02.12.21 14:20:20] wild: it's the 5th check from the pack, all 10 detects
[02.12.21 14:20:22] wild: how come
[02.12.21 14:21:11] wild: the 5th one by the way +-

[02.12.21 14:24:26] allen: I will redo it now with checks after each build.
[02.12.21 14:25:20] wild: thanks, not so hard, 1 check per stack is enough, but it's just really messy here
[02.12.21 14:33:23] wild: the panel also went with crypto 3 stub detections

[02.12.21 14:34:30] wild: moreover one pack had detects (I checked 2 from the pack)
and the second one is clean (checked 1)
[02.12.21 15:24:10] allen: I have to crypt the files several times. Till complete cleanliness. It has to do with random number generator. We'll have to revise it.
[02.12.21 15:24:40] wild: let's wrap it up then.
[02.12.21 15:24:55] wild: I'm almost done with the panel.
[02.12.21 15:25:03] wild: thanks
[02.12.21 15:25:47] allen: I have 6 pieces ready. Do you want it?
[02.12.21 15:26:35] wild: no thanks, it's ok, I'm already checking the last pack of 100
[12/15/221 09:34:04] wild: hello!
[15.12.21 09:34:29] wild: need some cryptos, can you do it?
[12/15/221 09:57:54] allen: Hi. Come on, but only 64 bits.
[15.12.21 09:58:40] allen: I have them clean. And 32 bits are still on the cleanup.

[15.12.21 10:00:00] wild: 20 crypts with rename entry point ```
LoadDeviceA=ClearNotifyList
`` so that the startup becomes rundll32 file.dll,ClearNotifyList
[15.12.21 10:00:19] wild: just a bunch please
[12/15/221 10:02:17] allen: This will take a long time. I need to test for dyncheck after every crypt.
[12/15/221 10:02:31] wild: 10 is enough then.
[15.12.21 10:02:43] wild: usually 1 out of 10 checks
[15.12.21 10:03:17] wild: guys who do 50 grand at once are not online yet(
[12/15/221 10:05:05] allen: Okay. I'll be gone for an hour. I'll be back. I have a problem with the random generator of intermediate codes. I have to check every crypt because of it. Bye. I think I'll fix it soon. When I make 32 bit crypts without detects.
[12/15/21 10:06:26] wild: got it, good, thanks!
[12/15/221 11:22:52] wild: haven't done it yet? Probably retired then, I'll do it in a batch now
[12/15/21 13:26:23] allen: Okay. I was crypting for manuel.
[12/20/21 14:47:00] wild: hi!
[20.12.21 14:47:17] wild: need two crypts, can you do it?
[12/20/221 14:54:39] allen: Hi. 64 bits only.
[20.12.21 14:55:04] wild: yes!
[20.12.21 14:55:24] allen: Come on.
[20.12.21 14:55:42] wild: I'm pouring it in.
[20.12.21 14:56:15] allen: 1. dl_g4_release_nologs_group_g4_ver_1_73_x64_regsvr32.dll?
[20.12.21 14:56:29] wild: yes
[20.12.21 14:56:42] wild: for crypt in dll, run through regsvr32
[20.12.21 14:57:32] wild: and dl2_x64_57_484.dll
[20.12.21 14:58:02] allen: both crypt as BK?
[20.12.21 14:58:04] wild: to crypt in dll, run: bkstart.exe file.dll
it's a special build mode, bkstart.exe is a file to run the module, it will be in the build kit
only crypt with BK profiles
[20.12.21 14:58:08] wild: yes
[20.12.21 14:59:59] allen: Do you have access to MAR folder?
[20.12.21 15:00:13] wild: no
[20.12.21 15:00:31] allen: So I'll send it through file.ip
[20.12.21 15:01:06] wild: got it, I'll correct the second file
[20.12.21 15:01:12] wild: they write to me...
[20.12.21 15:01:43] wild: dl2test.exe instead of bkstart.exe
