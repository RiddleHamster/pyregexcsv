Nothing, just update Defender to the latest version

2020-08-07T10:55:27 frog -> bentley

Hi.
Can you see if there will be detections on another machine with Windows Server 2019? Because on this machine both new and old exe files are missing detections.

2020-08-19T13:34:36 bentley -> frog
Hi

2020-08-19T13:34:45 bentley -> frog
Do you have a fresh build of the BC for the test?

2020-08-19T13:36:46 frog -> bentley
Hi. Not at the moment. I'm still working on the detects.

2020-08-19T13:37:01 bentley -> frog
What does it detect?

2020-08-19T13:40:59 frog -> bentley
BullGuard, for example, sees the creation of a shortcut in the autorun. When doing dynamic test on dyncheck, some antiviruses saw anchoring in the system (can't remember which ones exactly). I took BullGuard as a choice and am trying to figure it out. If I remove this detection from this antivirus, maybe others will also disappear.

2020-08-19T13:41:17 bentley -> frog
I see.

2020-08-23T22:06:52 frog -> bentley

2020-08-24T07:21:22 frog -> bentley

There just one of the antiviruses (BullGuard, I think) did not like it when it was writing to the registry and creating a shortcut at the same time. So I had to do it with a delay.

2020-09-09T15:06:51 bentley -> frog

Yep

2020-09-30T13:38:53 bentley -> frog

How do you mount the 7?

2020-09-30T19:09:11 bentley -> frog
didn't work after rebooting

2020-09-30T19:11:16 frog -> bentley
It should stick right away.

2020-09-30T19:11:36 bentley -> frog
did not work on all tests after rebooting

2020-09-30T19:11:56 frog -> bentley
Okay. I'll look into it. Thanks

2020-09-30T19:16:41 frog -> bentley
Can you see if a shortcut has been created in the autostart?

You can connect to some machine to see what the cause is. I'm checking at my place, everything works.

The bot should be fixing the loader.

2020-10-01T07:22:35 bentley -> frog
hi

2020-10-01T07:22:40 bentley -> frog
Do you need a 7?

2020-10-01T07:24:19 frog -> bentley
Windows 10. Didn't anchoring work on it or didn't it work everywhere?

2020-10-01T07:25:21 bentley -> frog
at 7 only

2020-10-01T07:28:36 frog -> bentley
Ahh... Thought it didn't work at all. Weird. Then windows 7 is needed.

2020-10-01T07:29:33 bentley -> frog
jr

2020-10-02T08:07:35 frog -> bentley
Hi. Regarding anchoring... Some kits use anchoring via BITS. Mushroom told me that it may take a few hours to start up in Windows 7 after a reboot.

2020-10-02T08:08:04 bentley -> frog
Oh right!

2020-10-02T08:08:06 bentley -> frog
Got it

2020-10-02T08:09:07 frog -> bentley
I tested it with myself, it runs right away. Maybe that's the reason.

2020-10-02T08:09:25 bentley -> frog
moge.

2020-10-02T08:09:33 bentley -> frog
Will you send me a fresh build to test?

2020-10-02T08:13:45 frog -> bentley
I'll send it to you later

2020-10-02T08:13:55 bentley -> frog
Dobro

2020-10-02T10:32:22 frog -> bentley
Made four builds as well. They are different. "1-A", "2-A" create a shortcut in the autoload, "1-B", "2-B" create a BITS job.

2020-10-05T06:36:59 bentley -> frog
Prvieth. Tested 1 build.

2020-10-05T06:37:15 bentley -> frog

2020-10-05T06:37:18 bentley -> frog
the rest are ok

2020-10-05T06:37:24 bentley -> frog
We'll run the rest today

2020-10-05T06:44:04 frog -> bentley
Let me check again. Assemblies 1-A, 2-A should create a shortcut in the autorun

2020-10-05T07:42:14 frog -> bentley
Checking with myself, everything is fine. See if the shortcuts are created in the autoload after 2 minutes of startup or a BITS job.

2020-10-05T07:42:30 bentley -> frog
Ok, let's check

2020-10-05T09:14:48 frog -> bentley
Would it be possible to connect to some Windows 7 machine to see what doesn't work? I've already tested it a few times on mine.

2020-10-05T09:15:18 bentley -> frog

2020-10-05T09:53:35 frog -> bentley
I don't see him in my admin area, so he must be in a different group

2020-10-05T09:53:47 bentley -> frog
strange

2020-10-05T09:53:53 bentley -> frog
Is it working now?

2020-10-05T09:55:31 frog -> bentley
Commands from the server are definitely coming. You can see it in the logged version.
It works, only I don't see it in the admin. I've had this happen when they were in a different group.

2020-10-05T09:57:24 frog -> bentley
Was it visible in the admin area before you rebooted?

2020-10-05T09:57:28 bentley -> frog

The last command "Get_SystemInfo" was executed just after the reboot.
I will check the second set now.

2020-10-05T10:38:29 frog -> bentley
Set 1-B BITS job created. After a reboot, it didn't start right away. Mushroom told me it might take a few hours to start after a reboot.

2020-10-05T14:49:24 frog -> bentley

2020-10-05T14:49:56 bentley -> frog
got it

2020-10-05T14:51:04 frog -> bentley

2020-10-05T20:20:16 frog -> bentley

Sent Xenon two kits today. Says it's not working. Although he sent bot logs, from accepts commands from server. I do not understand what is not working. I have no access to the fourth group in the admin, can not see what is loaded there.
