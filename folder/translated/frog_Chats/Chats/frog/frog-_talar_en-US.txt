You need a non-CIS SIM card. I need to register a cart. Or tell me how to do it otherwise.

Hi. Tested the bots, a question arose.
The description of the command itself has information, but when I click on "more bot info" there are empty lines "Antiviruses" and "Installed software". What can be the reason?
[10.09.2020 16:39:58] <buza> his hetinfo went through and you can see that admin got the data from this hetinfo and it seems to be even correct - this is if you look at the response of the command itself
[10.09.2020 16:40:08] <buza> at the same time, clicking on more bot info is empty

It's at the bots of group "7".

The list of software is fine, but the list of antiviruses is not displayed.
But the Get_SystemInfo command itself has information:
av: 1: Don't have information about antivirus software

Hi. Trying to work with the command server.
Kaktus said to report an error:
I accept the NOP command when connecting to the server and immediately quit.
On the second run, I run the command "/9ad32d8226adb0597c50579ff624615a/4" with the title
Cookie: group=2;
An error occurs. The status code is 500.
If I change the computer ID, I can accept the new command.
