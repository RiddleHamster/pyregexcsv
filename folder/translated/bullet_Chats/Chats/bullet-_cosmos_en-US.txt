Did Buza give you the ftp/ssh search engine project?

First, you need a script that will check FTP/SFTP and WSO shells for validity
and on all valid ones search for the following file extensions:
pdf, exe, zip, rar, gz, doc, docx, docm, xls, xlsx, xlsm

the list should be output in txt goo and "goo with files"
FTP/SFTP or WSO "file goody with files" and at the bottom a list of files with our extensions and name (price.xls)
after each bucket with files two blank lines


If we find something interesting on your ftp, I will write what you need to do to output the file correctly
I have blanks, maybe all you need to do is make some changes to one file.

Told him you have a ready-made program, you just need to do the configuration
