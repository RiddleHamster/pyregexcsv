Hey there, any news bro?

Hi, the software needs randomization of functions such as 1) what file to attack
2) where to send from
3) where to send
4) smtp - essentially static
5) theme
6) body

1) it doesn't like (outlook) that sending doesn't come from web-client but from some emulator, say there
2) the account went straight to the web

3) there is no option in the software to use proxies - I think this will very quickly score Ip aces will be stupidly fucked off

I don't understand about randomization. How should the mailing process work in general? I.e. take a random sender, a random recipient, a random file, and send? And how many of these parcels should be?

Sending emails goes through this program I sent, the account is used from live.com. And to send directly from live.com, it is necessary to enter it manually. From the program I can not do it.

What does smtp static mean? And what does it affect?

on randomization - give a choice how many letters to send from 1 mailer: a slider to send from 1 to 100 - the choice can be made any of the values in this range

further the body of the email
outlook perfectly recognizes html forms, so if you send it the text as an html page, everything will be correct
but you have to add spintax inside the software itself - this is a condition:
if there is a code/macros [rand:variant 1|variant 2] - so you have to choose one of the random ones

As for the proxy - just add the ability to throw a list of ip:port and alternative formats to the software to connect to smtp directly through the proxy
