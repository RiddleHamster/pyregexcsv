2020-09-29T12:13:32 mushroom -> professor
Here.

2020-09-29T12:19:05 mushroom -> professor

Yep

Later there will be a script that uses curl to download and run the exe.

2020-09-29T12:23:59 professor -> mushroom
thanks

2020-09-29T12:24:23 mushroom -> professor
It's easy to tell if it worked, the full path to curl.exe will be written at the end

2020-09-29T12:56:23 mushroom -> professor
How do I make a script that downloads a file using curl and then runs it? Do I pass the curl path and download address into the script as command line arguments, or do I write them at the top of the script?

2020-09-29T12:56:56 professor -> mushroom
can be upstairs in the script

At the top of the script curl and url, also write in quotes there.

2020-09-29T13:54:48 mushroom -> professor
Another one, downloads using curl and runs the file in base64 encoding:

2020-09-30T14:00:12 mushroom -> professor
The other variables are optional like arguments, opimation, etc.

2020-09-30T14:02:21 mushroom -> professor
Yes, it is understood that everything went smoothly, at the end will be written the full path to the shortcut.

Hi updated anchorage scearios. Now when you start a program you want from the anchor, its window is hidden.

Clarification of the autorun.cmd script

2020-10-01T14:31:41 professor -> mushroom
What's your question?
Do we want to run it without exe? Or is there a way to load it as a dll?

2020-10-01T14:31:45 mushroom -> professor
Before you run it, it is better to check first that there is no shortcut with the same name in the startup folder.

2020-10-01T14:32:10 mushroom -> professor
Launch where?

2020-10-01T14:32:20 professor -> mushroom
loads on the backed up car

2020-10-01T14:32:35 mushroom -> professor
You can run both exe and dll.

2020-10-01T14:32:44 mushroom -> professor
There's a run dll command in the admin area.

2020-10-01T14:32:57 professor -> mushroom
which admin area?

2020-10-01T14:33:00 professor -> mushroom
I don't have an admin)

2020-10-01T14:33:20 professor -> mushroom
Can I just send the one who tests these scenarios to you?
cause I'm already in a mess in my head

2020-10-01T14:33:27 professor -> mushroom
I don't want to engage in copy-paste only to get confused

2020-10-01T14:33:59 mushroom -> professor
I can also use a script to make the dll run

2020-10-01T14:34:12 professor -> mushroom
Yeah, dandis@ is about to scribble


2020-10-01T14:34:38 mushroom -> professor
With a script that uses curl to download and run an exe, you can have it download and run a dll.

2020-10-01T14:35:23 professor -> mushroom
Yep
you need a dll
the exe is very dirty(

2020-10-01T14:35:42 professor -> mushroom
on testing @dandis
he is about to write - please make him a dll variant

2020-10-01T14:38:49 mushroom -> professor
For this you need the name of the function in the dll to run.

2020-10-01T14:39:08 professor -> mushroom
yes, of course @dandis will say

2020-10-01T14:40:47 mushroom -> professor
If anything, you can run the dll through the admin panel, too.

2020-10-01T14:41:01 mushroom -> professor
Booza said your underlings have access to it.

2020-10-01T14:41:31 professor -> mushroom
I don't really know which admin panel you're talking about)

2020-10-01T14:41:39 mushroom -> professor
And through the admin panel you can run an exe without saving the file to disk, just in case it's dirty.

2020-10-01T14:41:39 professor -> mushroom
we are going to fasten with our custom load

2020-10-01T14:41:45 professor -> mushroom

2020-10-01T14:42:17 mushroom -> professor
To control the bot.

2020-10-01T14:42:37 professor -> mushroom
no no
these scripts are not for the bot to fix, we will with our own loads...

2020-10-01T14:42:45 professor -> mushroom
these are point options just where the bot doesn't survive

2020-10-01T14:43:16 mushroom -> professor
Okay, then I'm waiting for dandis to write.
