Hi. I have a 5/2 schedule, from 10 to 19. My BC has a bootloader crashing through Win Defender at the moment. Frog has got a detection today with Win Defender, it's being sorted out. Steller has everything done bootloader/bot, no detects (his bootloader is ps1 script). Price has made bot, he completes bootloader for it.
