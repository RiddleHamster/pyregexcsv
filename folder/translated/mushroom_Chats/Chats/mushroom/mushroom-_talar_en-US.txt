Hi. Have you made getting system information for the boot loader?

2020-07-10T11:13:42 talar -> mushroom
yes

2020-07-10T11:13:44 talar -> mushroom
Hi

2020-07-13T09:22:24 mushroom -> talar
Hi. I have all bot addresses return a 404 code when I do a GET /<id>/4 request to get the date and signature.

2020-07-21T08:54:55 talar -> mushroom
Hi all. Who knows a FREE DNSBL API? Exactly API

2020-07-27T11:49:31 mushroom -> talar
Hi. Give me access to the price and frog groups on the test server.

2020-08-03T11:19:23 mushroom -> talar
Hi. For example 99f2dc1d084229eb7196b7ded58953a6 I click on give commands get Exception.

2020-08-03T11:19:39 mushroom -> talar
And so everyone in group two.

2020-08-17T14:23:32 talar -> mushroom
You need a non-CIS SIM card. I need to register a wagon. Or tell me how to do it otherwise.

2020-08-24T07:50:34 mushroom -> talar
Hi. Does Buza's signature for the server only?

2020-09-14T13:56:30 mushroom -> talar
Hi. How to get in here https://51.89.125.28:12280/

2020-09-14T13:56:32 mushroom -> talar
?

2020-09-15T13:15:43 talar -> mushroom
Folks, who did I borrow 35 bucks in bits from? Lost history...

2020-09-30T10:38:13 mushroom -> talar
Hi. I've lost access to group 4.

2020-09-30T10:38:17 mushroom -> talar
We need to bring it back.

2020-10-05T11:40:24 mushroom -> talar
Hi in the paths to download the loader and the bot can specify parmeters?

2020-10-05T11:40:41 mushroom -> talar
The ones after the question mark.

2020-10-05T11:41:02 mushroom -> talar
For example /api/v89?one=two

2020-10-05T11:44:23 mushroom -> talar
And another question, can the grid be specified there?

2020-10-05T11:44:30 mushroom -> talar
For example /wiki/Poetry#History

2020-10-05T12:04:59 mushroom -> talar
Changed in the group o21 paths to download the files, I get the correct version, but the file does not download.

2020-10-05T12:06:11 mushroom -> talar
For example, here is the address to download the bot file https://grd015.com/wiki/Poetry/Genres

2020-10-05T12:06:36 mushroom -> talar
I'm b6 there.

2020-10-05T14:36:39 mushroom -> talar
Another thing I wanted to ask, is command 18 already in the admin?

2020-10-05T17:48:09 talar -> mushroom
not

2020-10-06T07:21:15 talar -> mushroom
not

2020-10-06T08:03:21 mushroom -> talar
Hi. XML parsing error: no root element found
Address: https://grd015.com/wiki/Poetry/Genres
Line 1, character 1:

2020-10-08T12:10:37 mushroom -> talar
Hi. When you make a GET request to download a file from loader and there are no files loaded on the server. The response comes with code 200, of course without the file.

2020-10-08T12:11:21 mushroom -> talar
So it is useless to check the correctness of the request by code.

2020-10-08T12:17:58 mushroom -> talar
I created a bug in bootlegers for this.

2020-10-14T09:49:43 mushroom -> talar
Hi. See how headers come in group two queries. You should check how signs come + / etc.

2020-10-14T09:50:25 mushroom -> talar
This is by task when the date with the signature is sent to the server.

2020-10-14T09:59:43 mushroom -> talar
Tell me when to send a request.

2020-10-16T09:06:10 mushroom -> talar
Hi. The keys I gave you will not work with openssl, it's a different format. I will make a translation of these keys into a format that openssl understands and give it to you.

2020-10-19T11:50:23 mushroom -> talar
Hi HEAD request https://numklo.xyz:443/issues/290

2020-10-19T11:50:35 mushroom -> talar
In reply to:

2020-10-19T11:50:47 mushroom -> talar
There is no signature.

2020-10-19T11:52:06 talar -> mushroom
There's a tricky roll-on/roll-off

2020-10-19T11:52:06 mushroom -> talar
Group o26

2020-10-19T11:52:08 talar -> mushroom
Hi

2020-10-19T11:52:16 talar -> mushroom
will recover soon

2020-10-21T15:10:07 PM mushroom -> talar
Hi. Here's the generated keys, in a format I can understand for openssl:
Download: https://qaz.im/load/4kA4Tr/8FHbQF
Delete: https://qaz.im/index.php?a=delete&q=1181535083
Password: WH>,44T)xGPI;3O4V

2020-10-21T15:11:08 mushroom -> talar
You can check it this way:
openssl dgst -sha384 -sign priv.pem -out sign.bin text.txt
openssl dgst -sha384 -verify pub.pem -signature sign.bin text.txt

2020-10-21T15:12:02 mushroom -> talar
translate sign.bin to Base64:
openssl base64 sign.bin

2020-10-21T15:12:36 mushroom -> talar
And you will get an example signature, which you will check in Base64.

2020-10-24T09:52:30 mushroom -> talar
Hi. What's changed in the admin. No signature?

2020-10-25T11:58:38 mushroom -> talar
Hi. Is there a signature on the new server?

2020-10-29T10:15:13 mushroom -> talar
Hi. Need keys and a sample signature I will send you?

2020-10-29T10:15:42 mushroom -> talar
I finished modifying the key program to make it work with openssl.

2020-10-29T10:15:56 mushroom -> talar
I can make keys and signatures.
