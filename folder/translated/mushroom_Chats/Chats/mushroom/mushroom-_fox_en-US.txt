It's a backdoor.

2020-08-12T12:53:14 fox -> mushroom
def is silent, is there anything else next?

2020-08-12T12:53:23 mushroom -> fox
Reboot your computer.

2020-08-12T12:53:36 mushroom -> fox
The backdoor should run again.

2020-08-12T12:55:32 fox -> mushroom
Rebooted, backdoor started

2020-08-12T12:56:18 mushroom -> fox
Do you check on other systems? Or are you only interested in Win 10?

2020-08-12T12:56:36 fox -> mushroom
vin10 only

2020-08-12T12:57:15 fox -> mushroom
all on that?

2020-08-12T12:57:26 mushroom -> fox
That's it then. You can remove the backdoor in the registry Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

2020-08-12T12:57:38 mushroom -> fox
And from the temp folder.

2020-08-12T12:57:43 mushroom -> fox
AllU

2020-08-12T12:57:47 mushroom -> fox
That's it.
