Hi. Did Buza give you access to the admin area where the bots write information?

Nope, I have a different link.

Backdoor document.

I'll get to it in the evening when I get there. Caught me at the door)

2020-08-12T13:00:59 hash -> mushroom
After launching, what should happen? Will there be any additional windows and stuff?

2020-08-12T13:01:14 hash -> mushroom
What will the dock end up running?

2020-08-12T13:01:20 mushroom -> hash
Checked for fraudulence. Check it out when you're free.

2020-08-12T13:01:34 mushroom -> hash
The backdoor will be on the command line.

2020-08-12T13:01:49 hash -> mushroom

2020-08-12T13:01:57 mushroom -> hash
Yes.

2020-08-12T13:02:00 hash -> mushroom
Got it

2020-08-12T13:02:03 mushroom -> hash
This is for testing purposes.

2020-08-12T13:02:08 hash -> mushroom
Uh-huh

2020-08-12T13:02:19 mushroom -> hash
Then we'll load it there without a window to work with.

2020-08-12T13:02:29 hash -> mushroom
Got it, good.

MS office 2016, Windows 10, version 2004. When you open instead of enable editing what you see in picture 1. When you click on what we have instead of enable editing this warning appears, press edit anyway, as in picture 2. If you do that you will get an error message and offer to send the file to the MS and this is a warning. On all three points you need to redo. On the first two, the user would be frightened because it clearly says it's a taco. On paragraph 3, even if the first two points, if we do not have - a few users will click on the Send to study the error and get a signal

Got the first two items now I will remove. It's because the TextBox invisible hash of the loader script for the backdoor is inserted, I'll hide it in the backdoor.

Let's try to remove 1 and 2, maybe 3 is directly related to that

2020-08-13T09:20:01 hash -> mushroom
But in general, we are talking about an error

2020-08-13T09:20:19 mushroom -> hash

OK.

2020-08-13T09:58:10 hash -> mushroom
If it has nothing to do with def, of course. Since, now there was a test with it off. But 95% that it's not related.

You tell me, for your work can you set up a server with a bunch of test machines, where there will be individually a certain set of AVs installed?

2020-08-13T14:13:40 mushroom -> hash
Not yet. Fox is a tester, I give it to him to check the stickiness.

2020-08-13T14:14:15 hash -> mushroom
But def isn't everything. We'll have to learn how to work with the rest

2020-08-13T14:14:27 hash -> mushroom
Following the example of the one on the link today

2020-08-13T14:14:49 hash -> mushroom
There are plenty of critical ones.

2020-08-13T14:15:10 mushroom -> hash
dyncheck is there, look at it.

2020-08-13T14:15:33 hash -> mushroom
Dincheck result is too different from the same https://avcheck.net

2020-08-13T14:15:41 hash -> mushroom
Dincek misses a lot.

2020-08-13T14:16:01 hash -> mushroom
Either they update less frequently or it doesn't work as well as it should.

2020-08-13T14:16:22 hash -> mushroom
In my memory I have never seen a detector on a dincheck from the same def

2020-08-13T14:17:07 hash -> mushroom
So it's better to have an account there - it will be more convenient to be informed

2020-08-13T14:18:25 mushroom -> hash
docx fits instead of doc if it does?

2020-08-13T14:18:42 hash -> mushroom
Better docm

2020-08-13T14:18:47 hash -> mushroom
Xlsm

2020-08-13T14:19:10 hash -> mushroom
There have been some difficulties with docx in the past

2020-08-13T14:19:18 mushroom -> hash
Yes docm which is the new format with macros.

2020-08-13T14:19:37 hash -> mushroom
Docx used to have problems with passability

2020-08-13T14:19:43 hash -> mushroom
The postal workers were cutting

2020-08-13T14:19:48 hash -> mushroom
But it is possible to try

2020-08-13T14:19:58 hash -> mushroom
Everything has to be tried, basically.

2020-08-13T14:20:27 mushroom -> hash
docx without macros

2020-08-13T14:20:39 mushroom -> hash
I'm the one who made a mistake with the macros docm.

2020-08-13T14:21:16 hash -> mushroom
You can try everything and make up your mind

2020-08-13T14:21:33 hash -> mushroom
I had one of the docs done without a macro, but with an active x

2020-08-13T14:22:05 hash -> mushroom
That is, you needed a little activity in the field with the dock running

2020-08-13T14:22:21 hash -> mushroom
Mouse cursor, for example, to swipe

2020-08-13T14:23:28 mushroom -> hash
This has interesting results doc 97-2003 sticks, but docm with the same macro does not.

2020-08-13T14:23:50 hash -> mushroom
This could also be

I'll just finish what I started and try to send it to my mailboxes in a couple of hours

2020-08-13T14:41:54 hash -> mushroom
To see how and where it will go

2020-08-13T14:42:19 mushroom -> hash
There's a test backdoor with logs.

2020-08-13T14:42:55 hash -> mushroom
I get it, the boxes will be my own. Just to see if they will skip. So a test backdoor will do.

2020-08-13T14:43:13 mushroom -> hash
Only use it for tests so you don't burn the backdoor. If all goes well, we'll upload a combat backdoor there without logs.

2020-08-13T14:43:26 hash -> mushroom
Ok

2020-08-13T14:43:47 hash -> mushroom
And tell me, how will the payload be triggered?

2020-08-13T14:43:59 hash -> mushroom
Dll is desirable

2020-08-13T14:44:43 mushroom -> hash
The loader itself is ps1, it downloads the backdoor dll and runs it in the explorer process.

2020-08-13T14:45:16 hash -> mushroom
So, in this case, the backdoor is the looder?

2020-08-13T14:45:42 mushroom -> hash
No they are separated so that the backdoor doesn't save to disk at all.

2020-08-13T14:46:13 hash -> mushroom
So what is the lowader then?

2020-08-13T14:46:27 mushroom -> hash
Backdoor can download and run any dll, exe, ps1, bat files with or without saving to disk.

2020-08-13T14:46:41 hash -> mushroom
Ah, got it.

2020-08-13T14:46:41 mushroom -> hash
As a loader script ps1.

2020-08-13T14:47:13 hash -> mushroom
Backdoor download commands are given to the backdoor how? Is there some kind of admin or something else?

2020-08-13T14:47:48 mushroom -> hash
This is how the document works it pulls ps1 out of itself and runs, ps1 downloads and runs the backdoor dll and is still latching onto the system to survive the reboot.

2020-08-13T14:48:17 mushroom -> hash
Yes there is an admin, remember I asked you Booza gave you access to it.

2020-08-13T14:48:18 hash -> mushroom
Well, this pattern is clear.

2020-08-13T14:48:25 hash -> mushroom
Ah, now I get it.

2020-08-13T14:48:31 hash -> mushroom
But I haven't gotten access yet.

2020-08-13T14:48:35 hash -> mushroom
So there will be a later

2020-08-13T14:48:41 hash -> mushroom
He's kind of gone for the whole month of August.

2020-08-13T14:49:01 mushroom -> hash
Yes for the whole month.

2020-08-13T14:49:40 hash -> mushroom
That is, we can send out our dock, and give commands to run this or that file later/daily/etc,

2020-08-13T14:49:41 hash -> mushroom
Right?

2020-08-13T14:50:21 hash -> mushroom
And what info does the backdoor pass to us in the admin area?

2020-08-13T14:51:38 hash -> mushroom

" [17:50:20] <Hash> And what info does the backdoor pass to us in the admin area?
I mean info about the machine it's running on

2020-08-13T14:52:08 hash -> mushroom
Ip, user name, domain, etc.

2020-08-13T14:54:00 hash -> mushroom
Of the wishes on the info will be - this information about the network adapter and the ability to understand this single machine or part of the network. If part of the network, how many machines in the network

2020-08-13T14:55:38 mushroom -> hash
You can send backdoor control commands through the admin area. Once the backdoor connects to it.

2020-08-13T14:56:16 hash -> mushroom
Ok

2020-08-13T14:56:34 hash -> mushroom
