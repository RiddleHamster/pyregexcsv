hi

2020-06-23T10:33:09 target -> mushroom
tell me please

2020-06-23T10:33:09 target -> mushroom
What's the hardest part about cleaning the file

2020-06-23T10:33:17 target -> mushroom
Because you've been doing it a lot in the looder

2020-06-23T10:33:22 target -> mushroom
this rewrites the code

2020-06-23T10:33:35 target -> mushroom
Or the logic changes in how the loader works

2020-06-23T10:33:51 target -> mushroom
Or am I misunderstanding the concept of removing dynamic detection, which crypt over the top does not remove

2020-06-23T10:33:56 target -> mushroom
If you have time, give me an answer, please.

2020-06-23T10:36:10 mushroom -> target
To remove dynamic detection you should change behavior of program which gives this detection, for example if program looks into register and writes there it will be noticed by antivirus. To prevent it from noticing, it is necessary to change behavior, for example to make another program to look in registry and write there another program, for example BITS.

2020-06-23T10:37:47 mushroom -> target
To remove static detection, you need to find that place in program code which gives this detection and change it (e.g. add some trash code, swap lines in code, order of function calls etc.). But this does not change the behavior of the program itself.

2020-06-23T10:38:30 target -> mushroom
give me your wallet

2020-06-23T10:38:32 target -> mushroom
bts

2020-06-23T10:38:32 target -> mushroom
your

2020-06-23T10:40:10 mushroom -> target
To remove the dynamic detection you have to change the logic of the program, and to remove the static you have to change how it looks in binary form (like hash change), but the logic remains the same.

2020-06-23T10:40:29 mushroom -> target
I don't have a wallet.

2020-06-23T10:41:55 target -> mushroom
I see, wanted to send you to the steak, for stupid questions

2020-06-23T10:42:00 target -> mushroom
as a token of gratitude

2020-06-23T10:42:20 target -> mushroom
I usually do this) when I ask stupid questions

2020-06-23T10:43:57 target -> mushroom
how does the loader protect itself from an av and how does the bot (in theory) bypass an av
the question arose from reading threads on forums about "our bot bypasses an av or a protection against av".
such a question

2020-06-23T10:43:57 target -> mushroom
thanks

2020-06-23T10:48:28 target -> mushroom
And probably the most important question for you as a person who joined the team and is involved in the program
I asked this question to many of the guys, I would like to hear your opinion if possible.

not having any idea about programming
don't know anything about it
but knowing what the end goal is (an SM system with API integration into the ringcentral buzzer)

How to set the right task what is needed
where best to look for such specialists
how to determine what kind of profile they should have (pcp, c++, python or what)
how to interview them
how to distribute the work between them
how to organize the implementation process
how to pay them

to eventually get a finished product, not delayed by deadlines, so that a person or people do not overestimate themselves
and most importantly did not waste time for nothing, well, some money

find a specialist, responsible and detailed, like you and Van, who will work in the office for a long time
but not in the specifics of malware, but legal software

2020-06-23T10:49:01 target -> mushroom
and make plz bts wallet, it takes a couple of minutes, or where do you drop $100 on a steak, from the bottom of my heart, for wasting your time and the right answers I always get, thank you

2020-06-23T10:50:20 mushroom -> target
Loider is protected by the fact that it is not known to antiviruses for a while, obfuscation strings (eg strings with server addresses, they are all encrypted), obfuscation of system functions calls (eg functions to send requests to the server), the binary file does not mention these functions, they are only at runtime and called, building by different compilers, crypto. Bot all the same, and it is not saved on disk, on this anti-viruses have nothing to scan, only on suspicious behavior can burn, for this at the beginning of the traps are removed, which set anti-viruses on suspicious function calls.

[05:40:14] <target> thank you
[05:44:49] <target> and probably the most important question for you as a person who himself came to the team and connects with progrmrmovnii

got it?

2020-06-23T11:17:43 mushroom -> target
I didn't come on my own, they found me through an ad. To see what this ringcentral consists of (what languages and libraries are used in it), on the basis of this look for someone who worked with these libraries and knows these languages, test task to come up with based on this. How to distribute the work is not up to me, I've never done it, on payment is also not up to me, I do not do it. It's better that these people have at least some open source projects on github or other places. Even better they should be able to program on different platforms (Windows and Linux) at least.

2020-06-23T11:21:35 target -> mushroom
got it about their language profile
i got it about testing the knowledge to write a module for cfg.
i asked about payment in the context of paying by the month or monthly
bring 10 people to the office and see who can do what and how long they're on probation

2020-06-23T11:22:50 mushroom -> target
Probationary period with reduced salary per month.

What is a cc?

2020-06-23T11:25:49 target -> mushroom
I see you in redmine working on backlog hours
you're the one who sets the time, you hand in the work.
it's like subcontracting in a construction site - if you say he'll do it in a day, he'll do it or he won't do it and you don't understand anything

He can say he will do it for so much, but the pitfalls will come out and he won't do it.

2020-06-23T11:28:05 mushroom -> target
Plus from how that person knows what they are doing.

2020-06-23T11:29:43 target -> mushroom

So we don't have it bypassing uac.

2020-06-26T14:36:26 target -> mushroom
Lowder

2020-06-26T14:36:31 target -> mushroom
Is that why a warning will pop up on win7?

I understand it does not upgrade to administrator privileges

2020-06-26T14:37:09 target -> mushroom
Lowder

2020-06-26T14:37:12 target -> mushroom
or boosts

2020-06-26T14:37:27 target -> mushroom
I think it is supposed to load applications and run them from the admin

2020-06-26T14:37:28 target -> mushroom
please explain

2020-06-26T14:43:00 mushroom -> target
No it doesn't raise the rights. It works from the user.

2020-06-26T14:44:22 mushroom -> target
Warning on win7 because the file was downloaded from the internet. On win 10 the same warning if the file is downloaded from the internet is not popular.

Or not even discussed

2020-06-26T14:45:14 target -> mushroom
I was just reading.

2020-06-26T14:45:16 target -> mushroom
and the mushroom is already gone.

2020-06-26T14:46:04 mushroom -> target
Not discussed, said not to raise privileges in any way. I think the warning will be under administrator as well.

2020-06-26T14:47:19 mushroom -> target
Because the file is unknown and downloaded from the internet, this is how all files get a warning if they are downloaded from the internet. If the user clicked once to execute, no more warnings pop up.

2020-06-26T14:49:43 target -> mushroom
Yes you are absolutely right

2020-06-26T14:49:48 target -> mushroom
I remembered

2020-06-26T14:49:54 target -> mushroom
On tests on vin7 running our pc

2020-06-26T14:49:59 target -> mushroom
It used to crash when you were an admin.

2020-06-26T14:50:51 target -> mushroom
what we were stigmatized with in the first versions of loaders? was it just by the window popping up or something else?
and question 2 - can we return the window in the box and in what form

2020-06-26T14:52:08 target -> mushroom
as I remember you changed the api calls to this detects were at the corp av on runtime or am I mistaken

2020-06-26T14:52:24 target -> mushroom
and on question 2 - it is very important that the window can return at startup we

2020-06-26T14:54:36 mushroom -> target
We can return the window. In first versions loader eventually got into antivirus databases and it was rebuilt with slight modifications, so it would not look like the one in the database. The api calls and strings were obfuscated. The bot was also straying sometimes, but I didn't do it, I don't know how it was cleaned.

2020-06-26T14:58:11 target -> mushroom
please

2020-06-26T14:58:14 target -> mushroom
put it in priority

2020-06-26T14:58:17 target -> mushroom
return the window

2020-06-26T14:58:22 target -> mushroom
and coordinate the implementation with the bouza

2020-06-26T14:58:24 target -> mushroom
I texted him back

2020-06-26T14:58:31 target -> mushroom
But just as long as it's on a rant.

2020-06-26T14:58:35 target -> mushroom
not giving us any trouble

2020-06-26T14:59:03 mushroom -> target
Good.

2020-06-26T14:59:30 target -> mushroom
now

2020-06-26T14:59:32 target -> mushroom
I began to understand

2020-06-26T14:59:36 target -> mushroom
What is getting burned in a rant

2020-06-26T14:59:43 target -> mushroom
And how do you clean it and why does it take so long?

2020-06-26T14:59:45 target -> mushroom
cool)

2020-06-26T15:00:01 target -> mushroom
essentially eo cleans not the deplude

2020-06-26T15:00:04 target -> mushroom
and you with your hands

2020-06-26T15:00:39 target -> mushroom
changing the logic of the api call

2020-06-26T15:00:43 target -> mushroom
Or am I getting it all wrong?

2020-06-26T15:00:53 target -> mushroom
Or just encrypt it

2020-06-26T15:00:56 target -> mushroom
then it's easier for you.

2020-06-26T15:02:23 mushroom -> target
If it behaves badly, change the logic where it behaves badly to get the same result, but in a different way.

2020-06-26T15:04:21 mushroom -> target
If we statically hide api calls, they look like a function call by address, not a function call by name, which will be immediately spoiled.

2020-06-26T15:04:53 mushroom -> target
There are suspicious functions their names antiviruses know.

2020-06-26T15:05:23 mushroom -> target
In what places are these functions, in what order.

2020-06-26T15:07:35 target -> mushroom
mushroom

2020-06-26T15:07:44 target -> mushroom
that still has to be found

2020-06-26T15:07:46 target -> mushroom
What's going on in there?

2020-06-26T15:07:47 target -> mushroom
and where

2020-06-26T15:07:51 target -> mushroom
runoff options

2020-06-26T15:07:53 target -> mushroom
You guys are monsters.

2020-06-26T15:09:26 mushroom -> target
Just disconnect the whole program, build it, see if it sticks, then return one piece of the program, again look, and so on to the place where it starts to stink.

2020-06-26T15:10:13 mushroom -> target
And the behavior of the antivirus itself says that it burned.

2020-06-26T15:58:33 target -> mushroom

Which is odd.

2020-09-22T13:18:13 target -> mushroom
got it

2020-09-22T13:18:21 target -> mushroom
remove all resdinet functions

2020-09-22T13:18:26 target -> mushroom
They're not needed.

2020-09-22T13:18:47 target -> mushroom
remember

2020-09-22T13:18:49 target -> mushroom
you were doing a looder.

2020-09-22T13:18:51 target -> mushroom
in october

2020-09-22T13:18:53 target -> mushroom
which pulled the file

2020-09-22T13:19:07 target -> mushroom
Same thing here + while the bot is online a couple more times we hook the file

2020-09-22T13:19:08 target -> mushroom
and that's it

2020-09-22T13:19:12 target -> mushroom
kill all other functions

2020-09-22T13:19:14 target -> mushroom
remove

2020-09-22T13:19:17 target -> mushroom
only exe and dll

2020-09-22T13:19:19 target -> mushroom
diaper

2020-09-22T13:19:21 target -> mushroom
on command

2020-09-22T13:19:23 target -> mushroom
as long as he's online

2020-09-22T13:19:24 target -> mushroom
again

2020-09-22T13:19:25 target -> mushroom
and ve

2020-09-22T13:19:26 target -> mushroom
all

2020-09-22T13:20:06 mushroom -> target
I checked it has no effect. Now there will be anchoring in the backdoor and optionally, there will be no anchoring in the loader. But that's not what's making it stray.

2020-09-22T13:21:50 target -> mushroom
Van

2020-09-22T13:21:52 target -> mushroom
can you help with that?

2020-09-22T13:22:00 target -> mushroom
so we'll take the win-def off with a cryptom

2020-09-22T13:22:17 target -> mushroom
But not all of the runtime is taken off by the crypt because of the logic of working on the system

2020-09-22T13:22:30 target -> mushroom
all statics are removed by the crypt

2020-09-22T13:22:36 target -> mushroom
do an assembly

2020-09-22T13:22:45 target -> mushroom
without resident module

2020-09-22T13:22:51 target -> mushroom
her on a crypt

2020-09-22T13:23:00 target -> mushroom
And then we'll see what comes out

2020-09-22T13:53:46 target -> mushroom
ok?

2020-09-22T13:54:16 mushroom -> target
Checking again.

2020-09-22T14:01:40 mushroom -> target
What to do with the window?

2020-09-22T14:02:43 mushroom -> target
"Confirmation code for RingCentral Operator #00020"
"ERROR: Update your Adobe Reader or try on another computer."

2020-09-22T14:07:52 target -> mushroom
yes

2020-09-22T14:07:53 target -> mushroom
great

2020-09-22T14:07:55 target -> mushroom
I've already forgotten what it is.

2020-09-22T14:27:17 target -> mushroom
I haven't dealt with this window in a long time)

2020-09-23T14:06:06 mushroom -> target
Hi. This bootloader is fine: https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/7911373c7c715b5f4b1f07d479fe109b

2020-09-23T14:06:46 mushroom -> target
That's the one you said to make primitive.
