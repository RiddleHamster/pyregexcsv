Hi. Green made proxy access to the internet on the computer http\socks using proxifier, the bot works. Receives commands, sends responses.

2020-06-30T10:03:38 mushroom -> buza
Hi. Can you take a look at it? Green made a proxy on the test machine like you said.

Checked. Bot can not connect to the server.

can a browser if a proxy is specified in inetcpl.cpl ?

Hi. Frog has done everything on the loader and the bot at the moment. It remains to obfuscate and test the kit. I'll tell Talar to make him an account on the battle server? So he can test it as in the case.

2020-07-03T10:29:37 mushroom -> buza
Hi. Just a reminder, you need to create an account for frog and a group on the battle server so he can test his kit.

Kinda managed to make an obfuscator on llvm 10. Included all 4 obfuscations at once and compiled the program 308736 bytes, without obfuscations 237056. This is with -O3 optimization enabled.

Hi. Botloader for Hash is ready, but Hash has no access to the combat admin, also Steller has no access to the combat admin. Botloader that did Frog also ready, waiting for your decision who to give it to work.

Hi. I think I cleaned up my x64 loader. You were right, I should have broken the chain of functions that do holoving. The loader now spoofs the image, then restarts itself and finishes the holoving and resumes the spoofed process.

Hi. Clarification.
- download curl package https://curl.haxx.se/windows/dl-7.72.0_3/curl-7.72.0_3-win32-mingw.zip in downloads or temp
- if your system does not have an archiver (winrar, 7zip, winzip, etc. popular archivers), similarly download some official archiver, standalone!

2020-09-16T10:07:00 mushroom -> buza
The Windows system always has its own zip archiver.

In most cases aclean shows memset characters from vcruntime.obj. I don't use these functions, the compiler inserts them implicitly. Maybe it's for initialization of some structures.

Hi. At the moment I made the bootloader for Target like he said, tested them, and I gave them to Bentley. Frog told him to give Bentley a stable version of his Bentley kit as well, and in the meantime he's finishing up team 18. Price is finalizing the loader, and then we'll have to obfuscate everything. Steller is doing the same old thing, he's on vacation. I'm doing scripts now.

Hi. Could it be that visual studio inserts something related to the project name into a binary file, but it's not a string? You can't find it with a hex editor.

Do you have alter online?

2020-10-01T14:21:30 mushroom -> buza
Hi. At this point I made scripts to fix #362 and gave them to Alter, command 18 at the bot. Frog did command 18 at the bot. Price has been on sabbatical.

Hi. Figured out encryption for openssl to understand.
It works like this, each party has two keys ECDSA_P384, they sign with their private key, with someone else's public key they check the signature. These two keys each give the same secret after the Secret Agreement. This secret is then used for AES 256 encryption. So they can encrypt and decrypt what they send to each other.

2020-11-10T13:46:36 mushroom -> buza
Does this option work for you?
