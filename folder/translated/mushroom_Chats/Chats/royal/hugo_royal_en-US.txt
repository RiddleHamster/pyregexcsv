[17.11.21 15:44:22] hugo: I'll create a Msg example later, where one static lib is linked to another.
Can you fix it if anything?

I'm just tired of prescribing additional lib dependencies in VS, I want to automate somehow.
[17.11.21 15:45:42] royal: Msg is kind of example that outputs MessageBox?
[17.11.21 15:45:49] hugo: Yes yes
[11/17/21/221 15:46:21] royal: I'm up to 19:00 MSC. If I need it tomorrow, I can look it up.
[17.11.21 15:46:35] hugo: Yes thanks, I'll send it tomorrow.)
